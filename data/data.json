                "speech":"Madam Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I rise today to recognize Dr. Stanley J. Dudrick and his many contributions to the field of medical science and to his home community in Northeast Pennsylvania.  Dr. Dudrick grew up in Nanticoke, a small Pennsylvania coal mining town, and through hard work and dedication, grew to become a prominent figure in the medical profession. His research led to the development of a technique that revolutionized patient care--the practice of total parenteral nutrition (TPN). TPN allows individuals who are unable to obtain adequate nutrition through the digestive tract to receive much-needed nutrition intravenously. The TPN method has helped save an estimated 10 million children and has been acknowledged as one of the most important advancements in surgery of the past century.  Dr. Dudrick's contributions to the medical profession extend beyond his pioneering research. He has published over 700 works related to the care and management of surgical patients and has authored or co-authored over 2,500 scientific referenced citations--the most for any general surgeon. In addition to serving the residents of Pennsylvania's Ninth Congressional District as the medical director of the physician assistant program at Misericordia University and professor of surgery at The Commonwealth Medical College, Dr. Dudrick is chairman emeritus in the Department of Surgery and director emeritus of Program in Surgery at Saint Mary's Hospital, and professor emeritus of surgery at the Yale University School of Medicine.  Advancements in medical research have allowed us to make important strides in increasing the quality of life for individuals who suffer from a variety of medical conditions, finding more effective and less invasive treatments, and most importantly, saving more lives. Dr. Dudrick is a pioneer in this regard, and his ingenuity, scientific prowess, and dedication to the human condition has made him a fixture in the medical community.  Dr. Dudrick, through his creative thinking and ground-breaking invention, has improved the health of millions around the world and contributed to the survival of countless more. Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing and thanking Dr. Dudrick for his many contributions to the medical community."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize my good friend, Gary Neal, for his many years of hard work and dedicated service to the Port of Morrow, Morrow County, and Eastern Oregon. Gary has served as Port Manager for nearly 30 years, and I would like to pay tribute to his leadership in the region.  After five years as the Manager at the Port of Clarkston, Gary was hired in 1989 to manage the Port of Morrow. Since that time, and thanks to Gary's leadership, the Port has grown to be the second largest Port in the state of Oregon.  The Port now houses facilities for everything from value-added agriculture processing to high tech data centers. It serves the area as an economic powerhouse. In 2017 alone, the Port generated $2.7 billion of economic output and created nearly 8,500 jobs either directly or indirectly. From 2008 to 2013, the second worst economic downturn this country has experienced, the Port grew by 88 percent. All of this was driven by Gary's visionary leadership of the Port.  Despite the multitude of successes, Gary is humble about these achievements. While all the above mentioned statements are fact, Gary often refuses credit, and instead points to his commissioners and the community when explaining the success of the Port.  This focus on community is also evident in the Port's countless efforts to support community development projects. Whether it is parks, schools, or athletic facilities, the Port never hesitates to contribute to the growth of the community.  In addition to his commitment to the Port, Gary has served the community in many other ways. He currently serves on the board for The Bank of Eastern Oregon; Pacific Northwest Waterways Association; is past president of the Oregon Public Ports Association; served on the Infrastructure Finance Authority Board for the State of Oregon for eight years, and is an active committee member with several other groups.  This breadth of experience and involvement has made Gary a great asset to me on a variety of issues affecting the Port and the surrounding area. On everything from issues with the Navy's Boardman Bombing Range and the Army's Umatilla Chemical Depot, to river transportation and renewable energy, I've leaned upon Gary's experience and ideas as we navigated toward solutions.  As Gary begins his well-earned retirement, I know he is looking forward to spending time with his family. Gary and his wife Kathy have been married for 45 years and have two children. Their daughter Rochelle is married and works for Nike. Their son Ryan is taking over as the Manager of the Port of Morrow. The apple didn't fall far from the tree.  Congratulations to my good friend Gary Neal on a much respected and successful career. I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him well as he pursues his next adventure."

Since they were founded, they have only continued to grow and expand their services.  The Rock Energy Cooperative's articles of incorporation were first filed in 1936 and has been bringing electricity to homes across our region ever since. Starting out with 199 members, it has since expanded to draw in thousands of members. In 2007, Rock Energy Cooperative expanded their operations to Illinois when they acquired South Beloit Water, Gas & Electric from Alliant Energy. Following this addition to their service, the membership increased by ten thousand and now reached across two states, Wisconsin and Illinois. However, electricity is not the only service they deliver as they also provide natural gas to people across Illinois. Throughout all of their years of service and powering homes across our region, they have consistently met their member's needs, especially those living in rural areas.  It is because of businesses such as the Rock Energy Cooperative that I am especially proud to serve Illinois' 17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to again formally congratulate the Rock Energy Cooperative on its 83 years of service to the community."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, today I rise to honor Second Baptist Church of Elgin, a spiritual pillar of the Elgin, Illinois African-American community for over 150 years. During Black History Month, I want to celebrate the beginnings of this vibrant congregation and the important contributions it has made over its long and rich history.  The first African-American residents of Elgin, former slaves who sought shelter with Union Troops after the battle of Shiloh, arrived in 1862. These newly freed citizens, regarded as ``contraband'' property seized by Union armies, were sent north in Union railway cars.With the assistance of clergy from First Baptist Church of Elgin, they settled in the area to form the cornerstone of a new African-American community. Desirous of having a place of worship they could call their own, the newcomers founded Second Baptist Church of Elgin on December 2, 1866.  Under the leadership of Reverend Dr. Nathaniel Edmund, affectionately known as Pastor Nate, Second Baptist Church honors the determination and courage of its founders with its sacred presence and community involvement. The church is a spiritual home to thousands of worshipers, and in 2008 expanded its capacity to serve with the construction of an award-winning multi-purpose building adding classrooms, a nursery, a welcome center, and a recreation and performance auditorium to its campus. In recent years, Second Baptist Church has broadened its reach through initiatives including the Prison Ministry, the ``Operation Joshua'' street ministry, and the SAFE Ministry to break the cycle of domestic violence. The church partners with Sheridan Elementary School and Larsen Middle School to mentor and tutor students identified as at-risk youth and has hosted numerous summits on issues of concern to the community. And emblematic of the church's outward focus, Pastor Nate has served on boards or in other capacities for a variety of important organizations in the Elgin area, including the Alignment Collaborative for Education, Advocate Sherman Hospital, the United Way of Elgin, Judson University, U-46 School District, the NAACP of Greater Elgin, and the African-American Christian Ministers Alliance of Elgin.  The ministry of Second Baptist Church is not limited to the local community, and an important part of its mission is to provide comfort and support wherever the need is most urgent. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Second Baptist Church rallied to aid families rendered homeless by the storm's devastation and adopted survivors who resettled in the Elgin area. In 2007, as part of its effort to support the ongoing ministry of World Vision, the church extended its generosity and compassion to a community in Tanzania, helping to build a housing complex for teachers and pledging continuing monetary support to over 130 Tanzanian children.  I believe the newly emancipated founders of Second Baptist Church would be deeply gratified by the congregation they established, now spanning three centuries of service. Madam Speaker, I want to recognize this profoundly American story of faith, determination, and good works, and acknowledge the tireless service of Second Baptist Church of Elgin to our community in the 8th Congressional District, as well as to all in need throughout the world."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan resolution supporting the concurrent-track approach to the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. I want to acknowledge and thank my colleagues, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, and Representatives David Schweikert and Rob Woodall, for introducing this resolution with me today.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict presents an immensely difficult challenge--a challenge to which there are no easy answers. Successive United States Presidential administrations have pursued peace agreements between the parties for over three decades, from the 1982 Reagan Plan for Middle East Peace to the 1993 Oslo Accords, Camp David Summit, Clinton Parameters, Annapolis Conference, and efforts to restart the peace process under the Obama Administration. President Donald Trump has announced that he too will soon unveil a plan for peace.  Despite a lack of progress on a formal agreement, Israel and some of her Arab neighbors have worked quietly and behind the scenes to improve bilateral relations in recent years. Common threats posed by Iran and violent extremism allowed for new dialogue to take root, and today, Israel enjoys closer relations to many of its neighbors in the region. These efforts represent an opportunity to improve security, stability, and prosperity in the Middle East. The concurrent-track approach--where Arab and Muslim-majority states work to improve their bilateral relations with Israel as Israel and the Palestinian Authority work concurrently to advance the Israeli-Palestinian peace process--should be embraced by our government as a new paradigm for the region. The resolution I am introducing today expresses support for this approach and commends Arab and Muslim-majority states that have already taken steps to improve their bilateral relations with Israel.  I, like nearly all of my colleagues in Congress, continue to support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, negotiated between the State of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and resulting in two states for two peoples, living side-by-side in peace, security, and mutual recognition. This is the only way to ensure that both the Israeli people and the Palestinian people can have sovereign homelands. The inability to achieve a two-state solution threatens the State of Israel's security and identity as the democratic homeland of the Jewish people, just as it impedes the well-being and self-determination of the Palestinian people.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure passage of this resolution."

Fidencio Hooper-Campos has much to celebrate following a stellar career as a steelworker and a public servant.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. Nathan Firestone, a resident of the Tenth District and a World War II era veteran prisoner of war on the occasion of his 100th birthday.  Mr. Firestone entered the service in 1943 as a member of a B-24 Liberator heavy bomber squadron. He flew 27 successful missions over Europe as an officer and navigator.  In 1944, his bomber was shot down under heavy enemy fire, and Mr. Firestone sustained serious injuries. He and his crew spent six days wandering through the Austrian Alps before being captured by local police and taken to a Nazi POW camp near the German-Polish border. As a prisoner of war, Mr. Firestone persevered despite access to little food, adequate clothing, heat and other basic necessities.  When his captors interrogated Mr. Firestone and asked him why he bombed Austria, he responded simply: ``Ich bin Juden (I am a Jew).''  During a relocation march, Firestone and several other prisoners managed to escape and reunited several days later with American soldiers.  After returning home to the United States in 1945, Mr. Firestone studied at Northwestern University and became a certified public accountant. He married, had children and raised his family in Highland Park. He suffered lifelong repercussions of his internment as a POW, seeking medical assistance from Hines VA Hospital near Chicago.  He is an active member of the American Legion, Jewish War Veterans, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. He also published a nonfiction book in 2002 about his experience in the war.  As he celebrates his 100th birthday, it is my great honor and privilege to recognize Nathan Firestone for his service to our country during World War II and his deep involvement in our community."

Professor Danziger passed from this life at the age of eighty years on January 8, 2019. He was memorialized at Epworth United Methodist Church in Toledo on February 16, 2019.  Edmund Danziger was born in Newark, New Jersey and spent his childhood with brother Doug tramping through the outdoors near their Hillside home. After graduating from high school in 1956, he felt a call to ministry. However, he found a different call to history and research while a student at the College of Wooster, graduating in 1960. He went on to receive his doctorate from the University of Illinois. Along the way he married his wife, Margaret, and together they raised two children, John and Anne. They moved to Bowling Green Ohio, where he began his 46 year teaching career at Bowling Green State University.  A noted researcher and expert on Ohio and Native American history, Professor Danziger's work led to the publication of books including Indians and Bureaucrats: Administering the Reservation Policy during the Civil War and Regeneration: Detroit's American Indian Community along with many scholarly articles. He became chair of the BGSU History Department, receiving teaching and faculty excellence awards and a special university achievement award for excellence. In 1995, BGSU Trustees named him ``distinguished teaching professor,'' only the seventh in the school's history.  Admired and respected by colleagues and students, Edmund Danziger explained, ``A master teacher will ignite a flame with his or her students--a flame which will guide them in further academic studies and more generally along life's challenging path.'' This philosophy sums up Professor Danziger's career. He took students on field trips to Fort Meigs, Walpole Island First Nation, and hiking the Appalachian Trail. He guided graduate students through theses and dissertations. A former student now an assistant professor of history himself said, ``He was the kind of person who elevated everybody he was around. He genuinely cared about humanity. He cared about students.'' What better reflection of a life well lived?  We send our heartfelt sympathy to the Danziger family. We hope they find some comfort in the gift of his life, those he touched and those who were made better by knowing Edmund Jefferson Danziger. Godspeed."

Mr. Joseph grew up in Knox, Indiana as one of five children. At age 17 he moved to Chicago and took a job working the soda fountain in the lobby of the Hotel Sherman, where he met an Army Lieutenant who encouraged him to enlist.  Mr. Joseph completed his basic training at Fort Sheridan in the Tenth District, and then was stationed in North Carolina and New York before shipping out to Europe. He served in the Seventh Army, which was the first U.S. field army to experience combat in World War II, as a Staff Sergeant in the 682nd Ordinance Ammunition unit. The Seventh advanced over 1,000 miles in nine months of continuous fighting, capturing Palermo and Messina, and liberating Marseilles and other cities during the course of the War.  Joseph worked supplying food to the armed forces. He received several awards for his service, including the Bronze Service Arrowhead and a Good Conduct Medal.  After the war ended, Mr. Joseph returned to Indiana and soon married his late wife, Beatrice. The couple then moved to Chicago, where they opened ``Jake's,'' an innovative burger joint on Armitage Avenue. ``Jake's'' became a hometown favorite, and Mr. Joseph opened several other locations in the Chicago-land area and in the Tenth District, as well as launched a retail line of frozen foods.  Eventually, Mr. Joseph and his wife moved to Northbrook to raise their two children. In Northbrook, Mr. Joseph continued to exercise his entrepreneurial spirit, receiving patents for designs of a paper towel holder and a napkin holder. He still enjoys creating and building replica models and spending time with his two grandchildren.  As he approaches his 100th birthday, it is my great honor and privilege to recognize Jacob Joseph for his service to our country and allies during World War II and his continued contributions to the Tenth District community."

On June 4, 1919, citizens of Tioga County joined together and signed a charter to create the Owego Chamber of Commerce. The charter stated that the purpose of the corporation would be to promote the general welfare of Owego and the surrounding communities. Even though their name may be different these one hundred years later, their mission remains the same.  The Owego Chamber of Commerce began as a corporation to encourage the growth of business in the Greater Owego area through the management of real estate. By purchasing properties and then improving those properties, the Chamber helped to create environments that welcomed new businesses.  As the times have changed, so has the Chamber. In its early years, it overcame the adversity of the Great Depression and worked to help their community through economic struggles. During World War II, the Chamber assisted with the selling of war bonds to aid in the war effort. Today, the Chamber continues a tradition started in 1999 with their annual business show. The business show brings new businesses and existing businesses together, putting them in contact with each other and the general public.  One hundred years of service to the community is certainly a cause for celebration. I congratulate the Tioga County Chamber of Commerce for their impressive record of hard work and look forward to many more years of them supporting businesses in our communities.

For the past couple of weeks, in conference with their House counterparts, they have worked in good faith to reach a compromise to address urgent priorities, including funding for our Nation's border security.  The product of this work is a compromise that no side will view as a perfect deal. For instance, I am frustrated by House Democrats' cynical opposition to including commonsense extensions of the Violence Against Women Act and other important items. Nevertheless, this agreement is something both sides should view as an important step, and today, I hope we will vote to advance it.  When the Senate votes on the agreement, we will be voting to avoid a second partial shutdown and provide the certainty of a fully functioning Federal Government. We will be voting to deliver another downpayment on the President's commitment to securing our Nation's borders and keeping American communities safe. And we will do it free from the influence of poison pills that sought to derail progress and stifle compromise.  To be sure, in recent months, we have seen the radical left go out of its way to try to gum up the works. Even the Speaker of the House threw her support behind wild assertions that tried-and-true methods of securing sovereign borders were now immoral. They said there wouldn't be more than one dollar for border barriers. They said there should be fewer tools for the men and women who enforce our immigration laws. Fortunately, none of that nonsense has carried the day.  So here we are, with a solemn deal in front of us. As the Senate prepares to vote later today, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to Chairman Shelby, along with Ranking Member Leahy and my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee. This legislation will mark success for our bipartisan process by finalizing all the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year. Thanks, as well, to Shannon Hines and the entire Appropriations staff, whose hard work made this agreement and all of last year's progress possible.  Later today, I hope each of my colleagues will join me in moving forward with the agreement produced by this hard work, and the President will sign it into law."

                "speech":"Madam President, a year ago this afternoon, I was sitting in my office in the Russell Office Building when a news report began to flash about a shooting at a high school in South Florida. I was the father at the time--in the case of one of my two older children--of a child who was still a high school student in South Florida. You would normally be interested, just in being a Senator from the State, but you would be most particularly interested as a parent. As it turns out, the incident and the shooting took place at a school that was about 50 miles--about 50 minutes--from my home, and we all know of the story and of the lives that were lost in this terrible tragedy.  On a personal level, it is clearly an issue that has affected me, first, because I am one of two Senators who represent the State. Every person who was impacted--every victim, everyone who was wounded--is a constituent of ours. Yet, as I have also pointed out, my two oldest children are the same ages as the victims. When you see the pictures and you hear the stories, you can't help but recognize the stories and the pictures, maybe just not individually. I didn't know any of the victims personally, but the stories are familiar. They are the stories of my children and their friends, who are of the same age and are at the same times in their lives.  It is impossible to fully comprehend unless you have gone through the loss of a child--by the grace of God, I have not--particularly under such tragic and traumatic circumstances. Throughout the last 12 months, as we have reached different milestones in my two daughters' lives, whether it was their proms or graduation days, or whether it was dropping off my oldest at college or attending a class ring ceremony for a junior, we have been almost reminded, for just a moment, of the parents who had expected to have been doing the same during this time of the year but have been unable.  I have learned a lot from those parents, many of whom I have gotten to know personally and have worked alongside, in the last year, on a number of issues. In the year that has passed, they have, as have the students, turned their grief into effective activism. The parents, in particular, are the ones with whom I have interacted the most here in Washington on a regular basis, and it is why I thought it appropriate to come to the floor today. I think they would say that the best way to honor the memories of the children they lost is to take actions that will work to make sure that no other parent will ever have to face this again.  Several of the parents have publicly described what happened a year ago today as the most avoidable mass murder in American history, but what was it that enabled this to happen? Why was it avoidable? What could have been done to address it?  In the brief moments that we have here--my colleague from Florida will have additional statements as well--I want to point to some of the things we now know that we didn't know a year ago today or in the days that followed.  From it, not only should that spark outrage, but it should also spark ideas about how to fix those things so never again will any parent have to face what they did and none of my colleagues will have to stand here and give a speech like the ones my colleague from Florida and I have to give today.  At the outset, let me say that the credit for much of what I am about to speak about belongs to the extraordinary journalists at the South Florida Sun Sentinel, who have done a remarkable job over the last 10 months of revealing to the public many facts that would have been unknown otherwise.  At a time when there is so much debate about journalism and its role in our society and in public service and in politics, they deserve tremendous credit for bringing this to light, and I think it is an example of why journalism remains an important institution in our country.  A lot of the attention in this debate has been paid to the issues that we are familiar with and have been debating long before this tragedy: a ban on certain weapons, universal background checks, taking on what is described as the gun lobby. These issues dominated the national media coverage, and support for these positions is not new. They predate this tragedy.  In our Republic, people most certainly have the right to advocate for this or against it. They have the right to lobby for it. They have the right to vote for candidates who support these positions and to vote against those who do not. They are valid issues to debate on public policy, but at the end of the day, neither go directly to the heart of this particular case and to the facts that led up to it.  At the heart of this is that the killer, the perpetrator of this terrible tragedy, was known to be dangerous for a long time by many people in positions of power and authority at the school district, the sheriff's office, and at the FBI, and no one did anything about it. This is now a documented fact.  Early in the days after this, we saw images of the sheriff and the superintendent lecturing people and talking about what a great job they had done, but the facts will show that it was their incompetence that allowed this to happen, and, then, even worse, they tried to cover it up.  There is an article entitled ``Schools culture of tolerance lets students like [the killer] slide,'' by Megan O'Matz and Scott Travis, reporters at the South Florida Sun Sentinel. I am going to read from it, and then I am going to introduce it into the Record. I am not going to read the whole article.  Here is how it opens:       Broward schools have grown so tolerant of misbehavior that      students like [the killer] are able to slide by for years      without strict punishment for conduct that could be criminal.       The culture of leniency allows children to engage in an      endless loop of violations and second chances, creating a      system where kids who commit the same offense for the 10th      time may be treated like it's the first. . . .       [The killer] was suspended at least 67 days over less than      a year and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his      problems continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. .      . .  The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained the killer's discipline records, they reviewed discipline policies, and here is what they found:       Students can be considered first-time offenders even if      they commit the same offense year after year.       The district's claim of reforming bad behavior is      exaggerated.       Lenient discipline has an added PR benefit for the      district: lower suspensions, expulsions and arrests along      with rising graduation rates.  It goes on to say:       Many teachers and parents say Broward has created a culture      in which teachers are expressly told or subtly pressured not      to send students to the administration for punishment so a      school's image is not tarnished.  One teacher who taught for 37 years in the district before retiring said she retired early due to her concerns about student discipline.  Here is a quote:       It was so many things. I had three students bring knives to      my classroom. One was out of the classroom for one day.      Another had so many things on his record, he was gone for      five days. None were expelled.  Part of this leniency is a program called the Promise program, which the superintendent of the district claims has a 90-percent success rate by keeping students from reoffending. That is a misleading statistic because, ``A student can commit a subsequent infraction without being considered a repeat offender as long as it's not the exact same violation, in the exact same year.  Each year they start with a clean slate.  In the interest of time, I ask unanimous consent that the rest of this article be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Schools' Culture of Tolerance Lets Students Like Nikolas Cruz Slide                   (By Megan O'Matz and Scott Travis)       Broward Schools have grown so tolerant of misbehavior that      students like Nikolas Cruz are able to slide by for years      without strict punishment for conduct that could be criminal.       The culture of leniency allows children to engage in an      endless loop of violations and second chances, creating a      system where kids who commit the same offense for the 10th      time may be treated like it's the first, according to records      and interviews with people familiar with the process.       Cruz was suspended at least 67 days over less than a year      and a half at Westglades Middle School, and his problems      continued at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, until he      finally was forced to leave.       The South Florida Sun Sentinel obtained Cruz's discipline      records, reviewed discipline policies and found:       Students can be considered first-time offenders even if      they commit the same offenses year after year.       The district's claim of reforming bad behavior is      exaggerated.       Lenient discipline has an added PR benefit for the      district: lower suspensions, expulsions and arrests along      with rising graduation rates. School district shuts down information after Stoneman Douglas shooting       The forgiving attitude goes beyond the schools'      controversial Promise program, the target of considerable      public scrutiny for enabling students to avoid criminal      charges for misdemeanor offenses.       The program, the pride of Superintendent Robert Runcie, was      designed to use counseling and mentoring to help students      avoid the school-to-prison pipeline. Under former zero-     tolerance policies, black students ended up suspended,      expelled and arrested at rates that were widely      disproportionate to their peers.       Desmond Blackburn, then Broward's chief school performance      and accountability officer, specifically instructed teachers      and staff in a video years ago to challenge and nurture      students, while using suspensions, expulsions and arrests as      ``absolute last resorts.''       Now, many teachers and parents say Broward has created a      culture in which teachers are expressly told or subtly      pressured not to send students to the administration for      punishment so a school's image is not tarnished.       Mary Fitzgerald taught for 37 years in the district before      retiring from Sunrise Middle in Fort Lauderdale in 2016. She      said she retired a year early due to her concerns about      student discipline.       ``It was so many things. I had three students bring knives      to my classroom. One was out of the classroom for one day.      Another had so many things on his record, he was gone for      five days. None were expelled.'' No one heeded warning signs about Nikolas Cruz before school shooting       Safety concerns at Sunrise were brought up at faculty      meetings. ``The message out there is that the students are      untouchable. Habitual negative behavior means nothing      anymore,'' state the minutes of a Faculty Council meeting on      Feb. 2, 2015.       ``My principal basically would tell me it was his job to      market the school. He was adamant about not looking bad,''      Fitzgerald said.       Runcie, in an interview with the Sun Sentinel, acknowledged      there are complaints that discipline isn't consistently      enforced.       In a memo to principals Wednesday, Runcie said he      reinforced that ``we have to be vigilant in reporting every      incident so that we can ensure our students who are victims,      as well as offenders, get the appropriate intervention and      support.       ``We're going to try to make sure, from the top, we're      sending the right message related to discipline and holding      our schools accountable,'' he said.       The superintendent said in the memo that he will propose      the School Board create a Climate and Discipline Department      to ``better monitor and support school teams as they address      students with major challenges and concerns.''                          The Promise program       The Pine Ridge Education Center, just outside Fort      Lauderdale, houses the Promise program, as well as secure      classrooms for other children who have been expelled from      their regular school but need supervision and guidance.       The principal describes it as a ``school of promise and      encouragement, not a school of punishment.'' Students call it      the ``Zap School,'' as in you've been ``zapped'' and sent      there as punishment.       Runcie claims the Promise program has a 90 percent success      rate at keeping children from re-offending, but that      statistic can be deceiving.       A student can commit a subsequent infraction without being      considered a repeat offender, as long as it's not the exact      same violation, in the exact same year.       The following year, they start with a clean slate.       ``It's extremely problematic,'' said Tim Sternberg, a      former assistant principal at Pine Ridge Educational Center      who administered the Promise program. ``You can develop a      psyche that it is OK to commit crime because you can refresh      the clock every year.''       Sternberg says he doesn't have confidence in the district's      data. ``They aren't tracking kids over time.''       Asked about kids starting each year anew, without marks      against them from prior semesters, Runcie told the Sun      Sentinel he will review it.       ``We'll make whatever adjustments we need to. We review the      discipline policy every year and have made some adjustments      and continue to take feedback.''                           Inside the Matrix       The district's Student Code of Conduct, first created in      2004-05, includes a complicated discipline ``matrix'' that      lists the prescribed punishment for a litany of offenses:      skipping school, violating rules, being disruptive, having      drugs, fighting, destroying property, committing a crime.       It was designed to help staff make fairer and more      equitable decisions in handing out penalties. But potential      punishments have become more lenient over the years.       More than five years ago, a high school student who used      profanity toward a staff member would receive a three- to 10-     day suspension. That was reduced to one to two days after the      discipline chart was revised.       The first violation for disruptive classroom behavior      called for an in-school suspension of one to five days.      Later, it was reduced to a suspension of under one day.       Since the 2012-13 school year, suspensions have declined 27      percent, according to the Florida Department of Education.      Incidents reported to law enforcement have fallen 8 percent.      The number of arrests per 1,000 students: down 64 percent.       The district's menu of choices for dealing with rule-     breaking students include detention, internal suspension,      out-of-school suspension and expulsion, where children can be      sent to an alternative education center.       Or another option: the Promise program.                              Under attack       Runcie is proud and protective of the program, which was      launched under his leadership in November 2013 when the      Broward Sheriff's Office, the Public Defender's Office, the      NAACP, the state Department of Juvenile Justice and the State      Attorney signed an agreement to reduce school-based arrests.       But the program is under attack because of widespread      allegations that Cruz, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas school      shooter, benefited from it.       Runcie had insisted that Cruz was not in the Promise      program, but he did an abrupt shift this week and said Cruz      had been referred to it in 2013 for vandalizing a bathroom.      Cruz did not complete the three-day stint, the district said,      but administrators haven't said why.  Broward schools backtrack on gunman Nikolas Cruz's Promise program                                connection       A couple of months later, he was sent to a special school      for children with severe emotional and behavioral disorders.      As a tot, he was found to be developmentally delayed and had      been considered a special needs child in school, entitled to      certain services and protections under law.       Some parents and community leaders have criticized the      superintendent for misleading the public about Cruz, and the      school district appears not to be able to make sense of all      of the records it has on him.       ``To me, it's an indication that the various discipline      programs in place at the district are confusing, poorly      implemented and executed, and clearly if we take the district      at its statement, they've been difficult to track,'' said      Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was one of 17 people shot      to death in Cruz's Valentine's Day massacre. ``If the records      are this difficult to find, clearly it would be difficult to      know whether this is helping students or not.''       Despite Cruz's history of discipline problems, neither the      schools nor police ever steered him to the justice system.The second article--I will be brief on this--is from the Sun Sentinel, by Scott Travis: ``Broward schools fought against 2013 plan for more security money.''  They turned down a proposal to levy $55 million in tax dollars for school safety, and one of the quotes is this: One of the school board members slammed the proposal. They      said they'd rather ask voters for money to improve technology      and renovate old schools, which they did in November of 2014.  In hindsight, that was a terrible mistake.  There is another article from the Sun Sentinel: ``What's being done to stop another school shooting.'' Again, it is a very long article. I will just say this:       Once he decided to shoot up a school, there wasn't much to      stop [the killer].       His threats were ignored, the campus was wide open, the      school doors were unlocked and students had nowhere to hide.  What has changed after 10 months since the shooting? This was back on December 29, 2018.       At least a quarter of campuses do not have single-entry      points to control intruders. Safe spaces to protect children      in classrooms haven't been identified.  The killer wasn't welcome at that high school, by the way.       He was known by former classmates and even administrators      as a potential school shooter. And still he walked right onto      campus.  It goes on to say:       [The killer] didn't keep his homicidal urges quiet. But the      schools incompetently handled the threat he represented to      his fellow classmates and teachers.       [The killer's] lust for violence had been documented      officially 69 times in his life. At least 30 people knew of      his troubling behavior before the shooting.  In fact, I have here with me the record of those 69 discipline points. It is extensive, and I ask unanimous consent that that record be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       The table below shows the history of incidents involving      Nikolas Cruz as reported by school officials during his time      at Westglades Middle School and Marjory Stoneman Douglas      High. In between those schools, Cruz attended Cross Creek, a      public school in Pompano Beach for students with emotional      and behavioral disorders.Wrapping up on this point, there is another article from the Sun Sentinel entitled ``Hide, deny, spin, threaten: How the school district tried to mask failures that led to Parkland shooting.'' It talks about efforts that were made by the school district to keep from the public the sorts of things that we are now finding out.  Finally, ``Here's what the [school district] knew about the Parkland shooter'' is another article that talks about, time and again, how this killer told people he was going to do this--not just one person, but multiple people--and nothing was in place to do anything about it.  I wrap up with a couple of points. The first is that the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission empaneled by the State looked at these shootings and from it, I think, are pretty instructive of some of the things I hope we can work on together. It looked at a 20-year period and found that 48 individuals committed 46 of these attacks, and 35 were students, and 10 were former students. So 45 of the 48 were either students or former students.  It found that the most typical weapon used was a semiautomatic pistol. It found that 50 percent of these attacks were done with weapons that were taken from the home--not even purchased, but taken from the home. It found that in four of five incidents, at least one person had some knowledge that they were going to do this, and in more than half of the cases, at least two people knew they were going to do this.  It is on the basis of these discoveries, working with many of the parents whose children lost their lives a yearago today, that last year we pursued on a bipartisan basis and passed the STOP School Violence Act, which provides, over a 10-year period, $100 million a year for strengthening school security, providing school training to identify threats before they take action, and creating school threat assessments and crisis intervention. That has passed.  It is why this year I have reintroduced the Extreme Risk Protection Order and Violence Protection Act, which will dedicate the Department of Justice funds to incentivize States to give law enforcement the authority to prevent individuals that pose a threat to themselves or others the ability to purchase or possess firearms, so that if information like what was available to authorities in Parkland is available to people now, they can actually go to court--to prove their case with due process, and take the guns away from this person before they go out and commit this crime. More importantly, they can alert their parents to secure the guns at home so they don't use that gun to commit the crime.  I have also introduced a bipartisan bill, the Threat Assessment Prevention and Safety Act. It creates a task force of experts to provide recommendations for a national strategy to keep our communities safe from targeted violence through threat assessment and management, which experts say is the best way to identify potential killers before they act.  If something like this had been in place, it is highly likely that authorities, putting all this together--what we know today--would have said this individual is a serious threat and we need to do something about it before they take action.  And, finally, yesterday, Senator Grassley and I reintroduced the EAGLES Act, which would reauthorize and expand the U.S. Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center to help communities proactively mitigate threats of violence in schools.  It is my hope that this terrible tragedy and what we have learned about it will guide us and will provide us a road map of concrete steps that we can take to empower communities, schools, and police departments and parents and families with the tools they need, not just to identify people who are potentially violent but to prevent it from happening and to get out ahead of it--maybe it is a risk assessment or maybe it is institutionalized mental health or wraparound services, but anything that can be done.  I raise all of this today because if you were to speak to the families, as I know my colleague from Florida and I often do, they will tell you that the most important thing we can do to honor the memory of their children whom they lost in this terrible tragedy is to make sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.  Now, there is one more thing we would like to do to honor the victims of this tragedy. My colleague Senator Scott and I have put forth a resolution that commemorates this day. It honors the survivors. It pledges continued support for their recovery. It recognizes the strength and resiliency of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School and the community that surrounds it. It expresses gratitude to the emergency medical and healthcare professionals of the community for their efforts in responding and caring for the victims and survivors. Most of all, it commemorates the victims who were killed in the attack, and it offers the Senate's heartfelt condolences and deepest sympathies to the families, loved ones, and friends of the victims.  Madam President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 71, submitted earlier today."

They were sons and daughters, brothers and sisters; they were students and athletes and musicians and teachers. Not a day goes that I don't think about that day and the amazing people who were snuffed out by the deranged actions of a madman.  Over the course of the last year, I have spent countless hours with the families of the victims. Unfortunately, I wish we had never met like this. They have been partners in our efforts to ensure that this never happens again. We worked together, along with educators, mental health professionals, and law enforcement, to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, to make sure our State does everything in its power to prevent tragedies like this from happening again.  Today, the State of Florida stands united with heavy hearts. Nothing we say here today can bring back the lives that were lost. Nothing we do can replace the angels of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School who were taken from us too soon. But we must never forget them. We must honor their memory every day, and we must rededicate ourselves to the goal of ending violence in our schools.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, later today we will vote on the agreement by the conference committee to keep the government open, as well as provide additional border security. Once again, I applaud the members of the conference committee and their staffs. They were the nub here, and they did outstanding work, nights and weekends, to reach an agreement. We knew that if the conference committee were allowed to work, they could bring this together. The agreement is a validation of the idea that when you put Members of both parties in a room to negotiate in good faith, when everyone is willing to give and take, progress is never out of reach. So, again, I thank the members of the committee.  The agreement is a reasonable compromise. It provides additional funding for smart, effective border security. It does not fund the President's wall, but it does fund smart border security initiatives that both parties have always supported, including increased security at our ports of entry and humanitarian assistance at our border. Most importantly, it will keep our government open.  Everyone, I believe, including the President, wants to avoid a repeat of what happened before Christmas. Everyone wants to avoid another senseless government shutdown. I expect Congress will pass this bill sometime this afternoon, and President Trump should sign it immediately. The Green New Deal  Madam President, on another subject, this morning, I challenge Leader McConnell to say that our climate change crisis is real, that it is caused by humans, and that Congress needs to act. Let me elaborate.  The Republican leader fashions himself as someone who doesn't waste time with political stunts. I am not sure I could count the number of times he has shrugged off a piece of legislation by calling it a ``futile gesture'' because the President will not sign it or because he thinks it would be a waste of the Senate's time.  Yet, on Tuesday, the Republican leader announced he would bring up his Green New Deal resolution for a vote because he wants to make sure everybody has the ``opportunity to go on record and see how they feel'' about it, knowing full well his entire party will vote against it, including himself, and that it will not pass.  Since Republicans took control of this Chamber in 2015, they have not brought a single Republican bill to meaningfully reduce carbon emissions to the floor of the Senate--not one bill. Republicans have controlled this Chamber for 4 years and have not brought a single bill to significantly reduce carbon emissions.  We are supposed to conduct the business of the Nation. We are supposed to tackle our country's greatest challenges. Well, climate change is the No. 1 threat to our planet, yet not a single Republican bill that addresses climate change in a meaningful way has reached the floor--not a one. In fact, the Republican majority has spent the Senate's time on legislation that would make climate change even worse. In one instance, the Republican leader moved to repeal a commonsense and vital program to reduce methane emissions, and it failed only because a few brave Republicans joined all of the Democrats in voting no.  Now, with amazing irony, the first measure to address climate change from the Republican leader--the first one in 4 years--will be one that he wants all of his Members to vote against. Let me say that again. The Republican leader announced he is going to bring up a resolution he intends to vote against.  That is what the American people hate about Congress, the pointless partisan games. Next time you see congressional approval level hovering around 15 percent, don't ask why. This is why: Leader McConnell proposing resolutions so he can vote against them and never proposing anything on this subject, climate change, that is constructive.  I hope the American people are paying attention because they need to see what is going on here. The American people need to see that this is all there is to the Republican plan to deal with climate change. This is all they can muster--a political stunt, not designed to make progress, not designed to move the ball forward. They are bringing a resolution forward so that they can all vote against it.  This cheap, cynical ploy evidently represents the sum total of Senate Republicans' leadership on the vital issue of climate change, an issue that cries out for serious engagement by Members of both parties. But rather than seriously engage on the issue, our Republican colleagues are taking a page from President Trump's petty playbook, trying to make this a game of political ``gotcha.'' They are taking their lead from the President, a man who is so willfully ignorant and foolish that he thinks he is clever by ridiculing the global scientific consensus on climate change whenever it snows.  Well, the American people are not laughing. They weren't laughing when a U.S. Senator brought a snowball to the floor of this Chamber to mock climate science. They weren't laughing when President Trump called climate change a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese. The rest of the world isn't laughing either, not when basically every country in the world--including Syria, North Korea, and Iran--is working together to reduce carbon emissions while the Trump administration has forced the United States to sit on the sidelines. I would say to our Republican colleagues that this is no game, and it is no joke. Climate change is deadly serious, and the time for all of us to treat it that way is now, before it is too late.  So when the Republican leader says he wants to bring the Green New Deal resolution up for a vote, I say: Go for it. Bring it on. You think it might embarrass Democrats to vote on a nonbinding resolution that some of us may support but not others. Trust me, we will be fine because the American people know that our entire party actually believes that climate change is happening and it is caused by humans. We actually believe the consensus of the worldwide scientific community that climate change is an existential threat to this planet, one that threatens not only our children and our grandchildren but all of us right now.  We actually believe that we need to do something about climate change. Do Republicans believe that? Do Republicans agree with the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community? Does Leader McConnell? I seriously want to know, and so do the American people.  So today, I am issuing a challenge to the majority leader. I don't do this often, and my colleagues know I would rather work in a bipartisan way on climate change, but this stunt--his cynical stunt--demands a response.  I challenge Leader McConnell to say that our climate change crisis is real, that it is caused by humans, and that Congress needs to act. That is what two-thirds of the American people agree with--two-thirds.  My strong suspicion, unfortunately, however, is that McConnell can't say that and won't. Leader McConnell has voted six times against sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that climate change is real and human activity has contributed to it. He has dodged the issue time and again, but maybe his opinion has changed. So when Leader McConnell brings his Green New Deal resolution forward for a vote, we Democrats demand our own amendment votes. Let's see if anything has changed since 2015, when only five brave Republicans were able to vote yes on a resolution saying climate change is real and caused by humans. Two of them aren't even here anymore.  If Leader McConnell blocks amendments, we will know where he and his party stand: against science, against fact--ostriches with their heads buried in the sand as the tide comes in.  If Leader McConnell allows amendments, allows an actual, real debate on climate change, we will see which of our Republican friends are finally ready to admit that climate change is real--is happening right now--and are ready to act on it. Unlike what Leader McConnell is proposing, that would be actual progress.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, let me start by thanking Leader Schumer for his incredible remarks this morning. There is a surge of energy around this issue. He has represented that surge of energy very well. He challenged the other side of the aisle to bring it on. Let me sign up right now as the proud member of the ``bring it on'' caucus. Bring it on. We are looking forward to this conversation on our side.  It is clear that the people of America want action. The polling is immensely strong on this issue. It is clear that the people of America see this issue in their daily lives. This is not academic theory any longer. They see the wildfires. They see the droughts. They see the floods. They see the sea level rise. They see the fish moving about. This is in their lives now, and the polling shows that.  A vast majority of Americans say they are--and this is the word in the poll--``worried'' about climate change. The world has reported they see this as the No. 1 issue facing the world's security.  Against that backdrop of an active, engaged, and knowledgeable American population and a world that is looking for the United States to lead, the city on the hill, what--what--do we get from the Republican majority in the Senate? We get a bill, a measure brought to the floor--the first time, as Leader Schumer pointed out, that the Republican-controlled majority has brought any meaningful legislation related to climate change to the floor--that they intend to vote against.  Who brings a bill to the floor that you intend to vote against? How is that possibly sincere or serious, and what is your alternative? If you don't like the Green New Deal, what is your plan? Where is there one?  The fact is, since the Citizens United decision and since the fossil fuel industry powered up its political efforts, there is now no Republican Senator in the Senate who has cosponsored any serious bill to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. They stay away from this issue like the plague.  The world has changed around us. The 2020 election has already begun, in many respects. Voters are alert to this. A Democratic House is ready to produce real legislation, meaningful legislation. With any luck--actually on the House side, somewhat bipartisan legislation, and here in the Senate, the blockade continues, and the only measure brought to the floor is a trick vote that its sponsors will actually vote against. That is a pathetic statement of where our friends on the other side are on this.  I hope this actually turns into a breakthrough moment in which there are some serious conversations on the other side to say this is not tenable; this is ridiculous; we are going to be embarrassed by this; but on our side, we say bring it on.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, our friends on the other side of the aisle--the Republicans--are misreading the moment. The planet is in an emergency situation, and instead of coming to the table with ideas on how to fix it, they are running the same play they always run; that is, that they take a popular idea--investing in clean energy, maybe making college more affordable, making the Tax Code more fair--and they try to characterize it as a liberal project so people put on their partisan uniforms.  Our ideas are popular, and what they have done recently is, they have taken a batch of our ideas and have said: Socialism. You are going to turn into Venezuela if you do all of these things. I know you think you want affordable college. I know you think you want climate action. I know you think you want to not get ripped off by the Tax Code, but that will cause you to be Venezuela.  This is the play they run every time, and they run it with cover from the Wall Street Journal's editorial board and FOX News to try to trick the American people into opposing ideas they actually like.  That is what is happening with this nonbinding resolution that 12 Senators have cosponsored. Republicans are trying to take frequently asked questions--a document that was posted on the website of a new Member of Congress, and then subsequently taken down and disavowed, and make you believe this is what Democrats want to do when it comes to climate action. They want you to believe we want to take away ice cream and aviation and everything that is good in the world because they know their position on climate change is absolutely untenable.  Over the last couple of days, I read some what we call very serious people in Washington, DC, sort of marveling at Leader McConnell's trolling exercise. This is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. It is not Twitter. This is supposed to be where we solve the greatest problems facing the United States. This is not where we troll each other. This is where we are supposed to have the great debates.  Senate Democrats have done all sorts of work on climate: the ITC and the PTC for solar and wind, conservation and efficiency, carbon pricing, fighting deforestation. So Republicans do not have the high ground here. They are trying to make this a partisan exercise, where you have several news organizations churning because they don't want to deal with climate change.  If the Senate Republican leadership wants to bring up anything about climate, I echo the words of Senator Schumer and Senator Whitehouse: We have never been more fired up. We are going to take this opportunity to have a real debate about climate because Republicans do not have a plan to address climate change. That is not a rhetorical flourish. That is not an accusation. That is just an observation. They don't have a plan to stop climate pollution. They do not agree with 99 percent of the scientific community saying not just that this problem exists but that Congress must act.  If you look at the last session of Congress, it is actually worse than that. I want to put this in context. The last session of Congress spanned two of the worst years of weather in U.S. history.  In 2017, there were about 10 million acres that were burned by wildfires. There were Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. In 2018, we had the costliest and deadliest wildfires California had ever seen. In these two record-setting years, climate change cost the economy and the taxpayers billions of dollars. Communities all across the country struggled to rebuild and recover. People lost their lives, their homes, and their livelihoods.  In these 2 years, the number of pieces of legislation that Republicans put forward to address climate change--even if I thought they were inadequate, even if I thought they were the wrong approach, even if I thought they were half measures or too private sector-oriented, whatever the criticism might have been, I can't even make criticisms of their climate policy. They have no climate policy other than to make things worse.  They have allowed coal companies to leak dirty water and waste into streams without having to clean it up. They voted to make it easier for oil and mining companies to pay foreign governments. They allowed the President to start the process of pulling out of the Paris accords. They allowed him to begin the process of rolling back your fuel efficiency standards, to repeal the Clean Power Plan, to prop up coal--even though it makes no economic sense in a lot of instances anymore--and they put climate deniers in top science positions in the government.  They put Secretary Zinke in charge of the Department of the Interior, and the first thing he did was to open up lands for oil and gas leases. They put Scott Pruitt in charge of the EPA, and when he finally proved to be a political liability--not for his climate policy but because of his personal habits--they replaced him with someone with the same policies, Andrew Wheeler, who is literally a coal lobbyist.  If you wrote all of this into a screenplay, people would say: That is a little too on the nose. That is a little too obvious. This is ridiculous. This is not actually how Washington works. They wouldn't put a coal lobbyist in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency, would they? They did. They did.  It is not just that Republicans don't have a plan to make things better, it is that the Democratic approach is to treat this like the emergency it is and invest in clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure, and the Republican approach is to put polluters in charge to actively, aggressively, and proudly make climate change worse.  I have seen the right approach work in Hawaii. For decades, since the demise of the sugar plantation, we relied on imports of fossil fuels for our energy needs. As recently as 2010, we got more than 90 percent of our electricity from burning oil, which is the dumbest way to do things. It is very expensive and very dirty. Less than a decade later, we are well on our way to 100 percent clean energy.  We have addressed the legitimate concerns, we ignored trolls, and we moved forward together. We have quintupled clean energy, lowered electricity rates, and created tons of jobs. Clean energy is the future for Hawaii, and it is the future for the United States. This can be done. Do not be afraid.  If Republicans think the Democratic ideas are no good, fine; then offer a different plan. They are the only major political party in the developed world that doesn't even believe climate change is a problem. There is no other issue where the majority party denies that the problem exists at all, not cyber security, not healthcare, not even income inequality. This is not tenable.  Whenever a Senate Democrat or a group of Senate Democrats come to the floor to talk about climate change, we usually have a good little group over here, and always--always--in my 7 years in the U.S. Senate, there is always an empty Chamber on the Republican side--empty. The only Republican I am ever talking to is someone who is maybe waiting to give a speech about something else or the Presiding Officer. That is because Republicans in the Senate have no plan at all as it relates to climate change.  We have trillions of dollars in infrastructure that needs to be addressed over the next couple of decades. We could make those investments in ways that also address climate. We could offer tax breaks for clean energy. We should reenter the Paris accord, but they are pulling the same play they always do, to make this so partisan, to mock the issue itself so they can continue to do nothing. They are whistling past the graveyard.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, how do we make our communities, our States, our Nation, and our planet better for our children? How do we make it better for our children's children and their children? Isn't that the task we have in the U.S. Senate, to make things work better, not worse?  We have this question before us: Do we have a carbon pollution problem? What is the answer, yes or no? I ask each of my colleagues, yes or no?  Presiding today is a new Member of the Senate from Florida. I have been down to Florida. I will tell you that I heard about the rising seawater polluting the aquifers and creating freshwater supply problems for communities in Florida. I heard about coastal erosion. I heard about coral reefs being damaged and the fish offshore. I heard about the toxic red algae on the gulf side--so toxic it is killing fish and dolphins and turtles and manatees, and they are washing up on the shore of Florida on the gulf side.  The people have two problems. The toxic algae is creating breathing problems, and then there is a stench arising from the dying sea life. People on the gulf side of Florida say: We have to take inland vacations.  I know my colleague presiding today knows about these issues in his State because we see the impacts of carbon pollution and climate chaos in every single State. We certainly see it in my State. We see it through the more powerful forest fires--hotter, more acreage, and more destruction. We see it in the smoke affecting the communities and the economies throughout Oregon. Of course, we saw the devastating forest fires in California, wiping out the town of Paradise and afflicting so many other communities.  It is not just the impact on the natural world; it is the impact on the people. When you affect the fisheries, you affect the fishermen. When you affect the forests, you affect the timber industry. When you proceed to produce conditions of more floods and more droughts, you affect the farmers and ranchers of America. It is the people of America.  How about the Panhandle of Florida. It was wiped out by a more powerful hurricane, driven by those warmer ocean temperatures. What does one say to them--that there is not an issue; that we don't have a problem?  The entire scientific community of the world has said you can see the facts on the ground, but we don't need them to see the facts on the ground. We see it through the everyday impacts on Americans, on our farmers, our ranchers, and on our communities plagued by smoke or wiped out by hurricanes.  So we do have a problem. The answer is, yes, we do have a problem. If you say there is no problem, then your head is stuck in the tar sands, and you are failing your responsibility not just as a U.S. Senator, you are failing your responsibility as a human being. You are failing your constituents if you think there is no problem, while their lives and their economy are being so dramatically impacted by this issue.  I ask my colleagues, did you come here to fail your constituents, to fail as a Senator, to fail as a human being to address this issue? Did you come to fail, or did you come to take on the issues that face us and build a better world for your children?  If you believe there is a significant challenge, what are you doing about it? What actions are you planning? Because if you believe there is a problem and you are not putting forward a plan to address it, then your leadership is a failure.  So we have a choice on the Republican side of the aisle. Is it that you are too obsessed with the power of the Koch Brothers to address the needs of the citizens of the United States of America, that you have your heads stuck in the tar sands? Is that the issue, or is it that you want to sit on the sidelines? You know there is a problem, but you want to sit on the sidelines and do nothing, in which case you are a failed leader.  So how about reject ignorance, and how about reject failed leadership and come together to make a better world for our children. That is what we need to do, all of us, together, because the impacts we see from carbon pollution and climate chaos--those are not impacts affecting blue America or red America; they touch the lives of every citizen, no matter which political party they belong to. It is going to affect every child we have now and every child born in the future, whether they register as a Democrat or a Republican. We have already wasted decades in getting at this issue. Let's waste no more time.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, before I begin with my remarks, I would like to take a moment, as I think everybody here in the country should, to remember and honor all the lives lost 1 year ago today during the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL. It was a horrible act, as the Presiding Officer of the Senate is well aware, and its reverberations are still felt deeply today, especially among those who lost friends and loved ones, many of whom work day in and day out to keep their memory alive.  We have before us on the floor today a bipartisan government funding measure, and as the chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I rise in support of the conference agreement to secure our border and fund our government and end any possibility of a shutdown at the same time. This agreement is a compromise between Republicans and Democrats, between the House and the Senate, and because it is a compromise, none of us really got everything we wanted.  When you are working to reach an agreement, whether you are in government or in a family, it is important to understand the difference between compromising on details and compromising on your principles. While this agreement may compromise on some of the specifics, it does not compromise on our commitment to our Nation and to secure our Nation. That commitment is also shared by our President, who has been unwavering in his promise to strengthen our border. It is a goal we must achieve in a smart and informed way to address the real and ever-changing challenges we face as a nation.  On the border itself, I have been very clear that our agreement had to include three critical elements, three legs of the stool: physical barriers, technology, and personnel.  There were a few sticking points with our Democratic colleagues. We did hear from the Speaker of the House that there would be no wall or there would not be $1 for the wall. Instead, this agreement provides almost triple the money for new wall construction that we appropriated last year. In fact, we will pay for 55 new miles of wall in the Rio Grande Valley where Customs and Border Protection has told us it is desperately needed. This agreement will build twice as many miles of new wall as last year's appropriations, despite the fact that we were negotiating with those who didn't want to have any wall.  Would I have preferred more money for the wall? Of course. But this bill provides the most money ever in a single appropriations bill for a barrier. I drafted legislation--passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee last June--that would have fully funded the President's budget request for the wall. I would have voted for higher amounts--and did, actually, in committee--of funding for the wall. That is because I believe strongly that physical barriers are a vital part of securing our border. I saw it myself when I toured the borders in California and Texas. I saw the need. I saw how the walls work. And I will stand side by side with the President as he works to secure additional money to construct a border wall in the future.  We got $1.375 billion, and that is a long way from $1. It is a critical downpayment on the President's ultimate border security goal. The best path forward to secure our border today is to pass this agreement.  The bill also stands with the men and women of ICE, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A statutory cap on the number of ICE detention beds would have required dangerous criminals to be released from ICE custody. It would have posed a threat to families and communities across the country, and it would have compromised an important principle. This agreement rejects that anti-ICE proposal.  I have said many times that I support the men and women of ICE and their important work to secure our Nation, and that is why the agreement before us gives ICE the operational flexibility it needs to accomplish its goals. Taking advantage of the flexibility this bill provides, ICE can utilize 18 percent more detention beds than they are currently using. That means ICE can continue interior enforcement efforts and be ready to respond to any surges on the border, so it gives ICE the flexibility they need.  I say to my friends who, like me, want more money for the wall: This agreement is better for the wall and better for ICE than any other alternative. Rejecting this agreement will cost dozens of miles of new wall and jeopardize ICE's ability to detain dangerous criminals.  Another government shutdown cannot and should not be allowed to happen. We need to provide certainty to our Federal workers and the American people whom we serve. I also think we need to restore trust in our ability to work across the aisle, to work across party lines to reach settlement, negotiated settlement that moves us forward, because if we are in a stalemate, we are standing still. In my opinion, if you are standing still, you are actually going backward, and we don't want to do that as a nation.  The work done by the men and women in our Federal workforce during the shutdown should continue to be applauded. Without pay and in a period of great uncertainty, thousands of men and women did their jobs at the highest level. We should be thankful for their service, and we are.  One of the things I am proud of in this bill is a 1.9-percent pay increase for the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. This is ICE. This is Border Patrol. To the Coast Guard, Secret Service, FEMA, we salute you.  Under this agreement, we will also hire 200 new Border Patrol agents over the fiscal year 2018 funded level to defend and police our border, and we will add $600 million for nonintrusive inspection technology.  As I have said before, border wall, personnel, and technology are all vital parts of securing our border. They are very critical in addressing the drug epidemic that has plagued my State of West Virginia and many other parts of this country.  This bill includes the highest level of funding ever in a homeland security appropriations bill to combat the opioid epidemic--more than $700 million--and it has funds for investigations when it comes to human trafficking, looking into the dark web, and other crimes.  The homeland security portion of this agreement also takes a major step forward in advancing our Nation's Coast Guard by building a new polar security cutter to help address operational needs in the Arctic. This is critical to our homeland security. We also address the needs of the TSA, the Secret Service, and FEMA--to name just a few of the other entities within this title.  This bill is not the bill I would have written alone. I don't get to do that. It is the product of give-and-take that is necessary to forge a bipartisan consensus. It is a strong compromise that will help secure our border and make America safer.  Senator Jon Tester, the ranking member of our subcommittee and the Senator from Montana, has been an excellent partner as we have worked to deliver a bill worthy of the men and women of the Department of Homeland Security. So I thank him for his efforts throughout this process. We have worked very well together.  I also want to thank Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy for their work in guiding the Appropriations Committee to a deal. These are seasoned appropriators who know how to get the job done. Their leadership has demonstrated that the Appropriations Committee can come together and forge bipartisan consensus in the national interest.  The leaders of the House Appropriations Committee, Chairman Nita Lowey, whom I know very well; and Ranking Member Kay Granger, who is a good friend of mine from my service in the House; as well as my counterpart in the House and chairman of Homeland Security, Lucille Roybal-Allard; and Ranking Member Chuck Fleischmann, of the Homeland Security Subcommittee. They deserve our gratitude for forging ahead with a willingness to negotiate.  I also appreciate the contributions of all the members of our conference committee, and I would like to thank a group of individuals who have dedicated a lot of nights, weekends, and family time to this effort. Their knowledge of the facts and their commitment to the cause never waned, even though their time to sleep did wane. Shannon Hines, who is Chairman Shelby's right-hand woman on the committee, was fantastic. Thank you to Adam Telle, Peter Babb, Christian Lee, Chris Cook, and Thompson Moore of the Homeland Security Subcommittee staff, which I chair, as well as to my own appropriations staffer, J.T. Jezierski. I say thank you--a big thank you.  I have spent the majority of my time today and the last several weeks on my bill--our bill. My thanks and congratulations also go to my fellow chairmen who have titles in this package. They have produced legislation that will help West Virginia expand access to broadband, combat the opioid epidemic, enhance our transportation, foster economic development, and advance scientific research and discovery. They, too, faced similar challenges to draft bipartisan legislation, and they too got it done.  In closing, although conferees compromised on details, we did not compromise our principles. Passing this conference agreement is in our national security interest. It will provide the resources, the direction, and the support that the President has said many times he needs to protect our Nation.  I am very proud to have been a part of this process, and I encourage my colleagues to join me in a bipartisan fashion in passing this bill later this afternoon.  Thank you.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"James Baldwin once said:       Not everything that is faced can be changed. But nothing      can be changed until it is faced.  That is why we are here again today, to face the history of lynching in this country. From 1882 to 1986, the U.S. Congress failed to pass anti-lynching legislation when it had the opportunity more than 200 times.  We have an opportunity, once again, to right this wrong and face the ugly history of lynching in America. Let's recall this stain on America's history. Lynching is an act of terror. It is murder.  These were summary executions. Victims of lynching were dragged out of their homes. They had ropes wrapped around their necks. They were hanged on trees. In many cases, they were castrated and burned as crowds of people watched and applauded. The premise underlying all of these acts was that Black people were not full human beings.  According to the Equal Justice Initiative, lynching was used as an instrument of terror and intimidation 4,084 times during the late 19th and 20th centuries.  In 1955, Emmett Till, a 14-year-old African-American boy, was lynched in Mississippi after being accused of offending a woman in her family's grocery store. When Emmett Till's mother held open her son's casket at his funeral, the image of his body became one of the starkest examples of racial violence in America.  These lynchings, I think no one can deny, were acts of violence. They were needless, horrendous acts of violence, and they were motivated by racism. Lynchings were crimes that were committed against innocent Americans. These crimes, for the most part, did not go without consequence. They rarely were followed by an arrest or the charging of a crime or the prosecution of a crime or the punishment for the crime. Of course, the victims of these acts and their families never received justice in our courts of law or in their community.  This is an uncomfortable history to think of, to talk about, and understandably makes many people uncomfortable because of the violence we are describing, because it is part of America's history, because it is something we have never truly acknowledged and recognized, in terms of the crime it was, the crime it is, and how we, through our laws, must recognize the seriousness of it.  Today we have that opportunity, and we must recognize the context in which we discuss it today. Just in the last month, we have had difficult and high-profile conversations about slavery and blackface, issues that are claimed to be part of a bygone era. However, it is clear that in many ways our past is our present.  Lynching is not a relic of the past. In 2011, three men in Brandon, MS, murdered an African-American man, James Craig Anderson. They robbed him, beat him, and ran him over with a truck. That is modern-day lynching.  Let's be clear. No one should have to fear for their life because of their race, national origin, religion, or sexual orientation. We must confront hate directly.  In December of 2018, our Senate colleagues, I am proud to say, voted unanimously, in a bipartisan way, to pass the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act, which I proudly introduced with Senators Booker and Scott. After 100 years and more than 200 failed attempts in the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Senate finally spoke the truth about lynching.  Today I have reintroduced the bill and will ask the Senate to pass it again. The Justice for Victims of Lynching Act is a historic piece of legislation that would make lynching a Federal crime for the first time in American history. With this bill, we finally have a chance to speak the truth about our past and make clear that these hateful acts should never happen again and, God forbid, they do, we are making clear there will be swift, serious, and severe consequences.  We can now finally offer some long overdue justice and recognition to the victims of lynching and their families. As Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., said: ``The time is always right to do what is right.''  I now yield the floor to my friend and colleague, the great Senator from the great State of New Jersey, Cory Booker."

                "speech":"Thank you.  Mr. President, I thank Senator Harris for her partnership and leadership on this bill. I also thank my colleague and my friend, Tim Scott from South Carolina, for his leadership and partnership on this legislation.  As Senator Harris just said, this is not the first time we have come down to the floor of the U.S. Senate to implore this body to recognize lynching for what it is--bias-related terror. It is not the first time we have come down to this body to try to right the wrongs of history. After numerous attempts--dozens and dozens--during the height of lynchings in the United States, this body failed to act. This body did not stand up to protect American citizens and condemn the horrors of lynching.  In December of last year, as Senator Harris and I were standing here, this body actually made a historic decision. It was a profound moment, an emotional moment. They made the decision to pass the Justice for Victims of Lynching Act by unanimous consent--no opposition.  After a long, painful, and shameful history of this body, the U.S. Senate finally voted unanimously to make lynching a Federal crime. Unfortunately, the bill was not taken up in the House before the end of the last Congress. So we are here today with the hope and expectation that for the second time this body will make history by passing Federal anti-lynching legislation and that, for the first time in history, this bill will actually become the law of the land.  Senator Harris referenced the Equal Justice Initiative, which documented over 4,000 cases of racially motivated lynchings between 1877 and well into the 20th century. Lynchings were used to terrorize, marginalize, and oppress Black communities, to kill human beings in order to sow deeper fear, inequality, and injustice for generations.  The use of lynching to inflict racial terror is ugly, disturbing. It is a tragic part of our history, but we know its legacy does not just live in our history books. Less than 2 weeks ago, an actor and activist was brutally attacked in Chicago by two men yelling racial and homophobic epithets.  Lynching is not a relic of the past. We are seeing in the present pernicious evil, and we still have yet to confront this in this body. Bias-motivated acts of violence and intimidation in America are actually on the rise. Hate crimes are on the rise for the third year in a row. Hate crimes against Black Americans are on the rise. Hate crimes against Jewish Americans are on the rise. Hate crimes against LGBTQ Americans and Muslim Americans are on the rise. This is unacceptable. Justice for the victims of lynching has been too long denied, and as we look forward we must collectively in this body make a strong, unequivocal statement.  The last time Senator Harris and I came to the floor with this request, I read from an excerpt of a speech given by Congressman George Henry White, the first Member of Congress to introduce an anti-lynching bill more than a century ago and the last Black Member of Congress to serve for decades following Reconstruction.  In 1901, in the last speech he ever gave on the floor, the last speech of a Black Congressman for decades, he said about the terror of lynching: ``This evil peculiar to America, yes, to the United States, must be met somehow, some day.''  For too long in this body, in the U.S. Congress, we have relied on the inevitability of ``some day'' when it comes to addressing this profound injustice. For too long we have failed--failed--to ensure justice for the victims of lynching, and failed to make clear that in the United States of America, in this great country, lynching is and always has been not just a Federal crime but a moral failure.  We have the opportunity right now, again, to make history in this moment. We have the opportunity right now to recognize the wrongs of both our history and our recent past, to honor the memories of those so brutally murdered, and to leave a legacy that future generations can look back on. We will know, after some 200 attempts in this body in more than 100 years, that on this day, this moment in American history--notably Valentine's Day; as one leader once said, ``Never forget that justice is what love looks like in public''--that on this day, we can right this wrong.  I would like to recognize the Senator from California.  Ms. HARRIS. Thank you, Senator Booker. Happy Valentine's Day to you.  Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 488, introduced earlier today."

                "speech":"Mr. President, late last night, we received the text of the appropriations agreement to fund the remaining portions of the government through the end of this fiscal year, which is through the end of September.  We were successful in doing something that we had not done in a long time previously, which was to fund 75 percent of the Federal Government, leaving 25 percent remaining. Unfortunately, the remaining 25 percent was held hostage to this unreasonable and unnecessary debate over whether we should fund border security. I say the debate was unnecessary because I thought that we all shared a conviction that it was important to secure our border.  It is important to note that most of the bill that we will vote on later today has been out in the public domain for more than 6 months. It is the product of bipartisan deliberation by the Appropriations Committee and has been available to any Senator who might want to be acquainted with the details.  The part that is relatively new is the detail relative to border security. I am pleased that, notwithstanding Speaker Pelosi's statement that physical barriers are somehow immoral, this does authorize and fund up to 55 miles of additional fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border.  I believe that border security consists of three components: physical barriers in hard-to-control locations; technology, which is important as a force multiplier; and then, of course, the boots on the ground--the Border Patrol agents, who are absolutely essential. I am pleased to say that this piece of legislation incorporates all three of those components of what makes up smart and sensible border security.  I am also happy to see that the initial demands made by our colleagues across the aisle that we limit the number of detention beds are not in this bill and that law enforcement can continue to detain people with criminal records who happen to be illegally in this country so that we can discourage and deter further illegal immigration.  One of the worst aspects of our broken immigration system is this notion of catch-and-release. During the George W. Bush administration, I remember talking to Secretary Chertoff about this huge upsurge in Brazilians coming across our border. I asked Secretary Chertoff why we were seeing all these Brazilians coming. He said it was catch-and-release. They knew that if there were no penalty associated with coming across or if they wouldn't be detained, there was no deterrence.  I am glad to see that this appropriations bill, which will prevent another government shutdown, contains no cap on detention beds to detain criminal aliens and others who are exploiting vulnerabilities in our immigration system.  I would say, though, one of the things that is notably absent in this bill is an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which provides resources to assist women who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Republicans made absolutely clear from the get-go that we wanted to extend the current law. I am incredulous that our Democratic colleagues objected to extending the current law, the Violence Against Women Act.  It is really hard for me to believe that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats object to a modest extension of this critical legislation, which helped countless victims receive the support they need, but because of the political jockeying, the Violence Against Women Act will expire at midnight tomorrow. There were two options available to us. One was to provide an extension through the end of the fiscal year--through the end of September--which would have allowed us to work on a long-term reauthorization under regular order. The second option, which our Democratic colleagues chose, is to do nothing and let this important legislation expire while trying to plot out a long-term plan. The choice seemed pretty obvious to me, but apparently not to Speaker Pelosi and not to the Democratic leader here in the Senate.  Since my days as attorney general, I have long been a believer in advocating for victims' rights. I am beyond disappointed that we have ended up in this situation. It is shameful to play politics with the Violence Against Women Act. But because of their obstruction, this important resource for victims across the country will lapse tomorrow night at midnight.                           The Green New Deal  Mr. President, we have seen a lot of discussion lately about the so-called Green New Deal. It has been stealing headlines and capturing people's imaginations. It has been the subject of a lot of social media interaction and certainly has had a lot of coverage on TV and in the papers.  It has ended up causing quite a headache for our colleagues across the aisle who have tried to explain exactly what they are trying to do and how they are trying to do it. Last week, the junior Senator from Massachusetts introduced with Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez of New York a resolution that was framed as a way to create jobs and fight climate change. A number of Presidential aspirants here in the Senate--and there are a lot--quickly embraced this resolution.  If you lived in a vacuum and you saw only the text of the resolution, you might say: Well, this is a pretty good idea. It mentions things like creating high-wage jobs, ensuring economic prosperity, investing in infrastructure and industry, and securing clean air and water for all. That sounds pretty good. But the resolution does not spell out how we are supposed to achieve all of those things.  Fortunately, one of the authors released a summary, which, oddly enough, provided more details on what the Green New Deal strives to do. It tells us more than the actual resolution does. One of the lines of the resolution says to ensure ``prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States.'' But the summary clarifies that this is, in reality, a new entitlement program on steroids. This, at a time when our national debt just hit $22 trillion, adds additional entitlement spending on top of it.  This provision would guarantee every person in the United States a job, healthcare, education, healthy food, and paid vacations. They might have thrown in free beer and pizza too. But they take it even a step further. According to the Green New Deal, the government will foot the bill for any person who is ``unable or unwilling to work.'' If you don't like your job, don't want to get out of bed in the morning, don't feel like going to the office today, no worries. The Green New Deal says you don't have to go to work. And the people who do go to work--the hard-working taxpayers of America--will foot the bill.  Another component of this Green New Deal is to move to 100 percent clean and renewable energy in just 10 years. I come from an energy State, the State of Texas. When people think about Texas, they think about oil and gas, but we actually believe in all of the above. We generate more electricity from wind than any other State in the country because we have more infrastructure deployed for that.  I actually think moving toward cleaner and renewable energy is a good thing. But they want to do it in 10 years, and they don't answer the question about how much it will cost. Some estimates put the pricetag at $5.7 trillion. That is $2 trillion more than our annual tax revenue. In other words, it would add $3.7 trillion to the national debt.  Remember, that is just for the energy portion of the Green New Deal. There are other components, as well. There is Medicare for All, which, of course, would destroy the private insurance industry and employer-provided coverage and would be unaffordable. They offer free college, paying the way for people who are able but don't want to work.  This is an extraordinary wish list, combining the most costly ideas of the radical fringes on the left in one place. It is really remarkable they were able to condense all of these into one place, where we could understand the entire picture.  The resolution also commits to update ``all existing buildings . . . to achieve maximal energy efficiency, water efficiency, safety, affordability, comfort, and durability.'' I am all for local and State government and, where it is appropriate, Federal Government to talk about building codes and energy efficiency. That is a desirable thing. But to try to retrofit every government building, every airport, every football stadium, every home, every grocery store, and every shopping mall--every single building in the United States would have to be updated. How crazy is that? How much would that cost?  On second thought, I guess we don't have to worry about updating airports because the Green New Deal also calls for building ``high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.'' I saw an interview with our friend the Senator from Hawaii, who was asked about that component of the Green New Deal. She said: Well, that wouldn't work very well for Hawaii. High-speed rail wouldn't exactly get you from the west coast out to Hawaii.  I hate to burst their bubble, but this is not something that is feasible or easy to do. Look at California talking about high-speed rail. Earlier this week, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the State was hitting the brakes on a high-speed rail project because it would take too long and cost too much. I bet Governor Newsom and I don't agree on a lot from a political standpoint, but I agree with him on that.  Last March, California estimated that the project would cost between $77 and $98 billion, and that is just to connect Northern and Southern California. I can't imagine how much it would cost to build a high-speed rail to connect California to Maine. If the word ``green'' refers to the amount of money this would cost, then at least that point is accurate.  There are no details on how we are going to pay for all of this, of course, because our Democratic colleagues know that the Green New Deal is entirely fantasy--it is unrealistic. These are just talking points that have been designed to appeal to the fringe of their political party and to make a political statement. That is why a number of our colleagues on the Democratic side changed their tune once the majority leader announced that the Senate would vote on this resolution.  Generally speaking, in my experience in the Senate, if you introduce a bill or a resolution, you are thrilled to hear the majority leader say he is going to schedule it for a vote on the floor--but not the Senator from Massachusetts, one of the proponents of the Green New Deal. Following the leader's announcement, he released a statement that decried Senator McConnell's effort to ``sabotage'' the Green New Deal by his giving them a vote on their resolution. Apparently, holding a vote on something you have introduced is now a form of sabotage in this wild and wacky world in which we currently live. The Senator from Minnesota, who announced her bid for President, later downplayed her support and brushed it all off as aspirational.  Our constituents didn't send us to Washington to advocate for partisan wish lists that will never be voted on. They want us to be accountable as their elected Representatives. They sent us here to craft legislation that can and will make our country stronger. This Green New Deal is nothing more than a Socialist agenda that is being disguised as feel-good environmental policy, and it is indicative, unfortunately, of the hard left turn our friends across the aisle, the Democratic Party, have taken.  The Green New Deal is not what our country needs, and as we have heard from both Republicans and Democrats over the last several days, it is not what our country wants.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, later today, we hope we will have an opportunity to vote on legislation that will fund the government and provide much needed support for border security. While no agreement is perfect and not everybody gets everything one wants, this makes a significant downpayment on a border wall as well as on other border security measures. At the same time, it funds all of the appropriations bills for this fiscal year.  I hope, as our Members review the text, they will have an opportunity to conclude that we will be able to get the votes that will be necessary to move the legislation through the Senate and, hopefully, ultimately, through the House and to the President and that the President will be able to sign it into law. So stay tuned on that. Hopefully, that will all transpire later today.                               Tax Reform  Mr. President, tax reform is working. When Republicans took office 2 years ago, we had one goal in mind, and that was to make life better for the American people. Key to that goal was getting our economy going again after years of economic stagnation under the Obama administration. We took action to lift burdensome regulations, and in December of 2017, we passed the historic, comprehensive reform of our Nation's Tax Code.  Why the Tax Code?  Well, the Tax Code plays a huge role in the health of our economy. It helps to determine how much money individuals and families have to spend and to save. It helps to determine whether a small business can expand and hire. It helps to determine whether larger businesses hire, invest, and stay in the United States. A small business owner who faces a huge tax bill is highly unlikely to be able to expand her business or to hire a new employee. A larger business is going to find it hard to create jobs or to improve benefits for employees if it is struggling to stay competitive against foreign businesses that pay much less in taxes. A larger business is also unlikely to keep jobs and investment in the United States if the Tax Code makes it vastly more expensive to hire American workers.  Before we passed tax reform a year ago in December, our Tax Code was not helping our economy. It was taking way too much money from American families, and it was making it harder for businesses, large and small, to create jobs, increase wages, and grow. That is why, after months of work, we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  This legislation cut tax rates for American families, doubled the child tax credit, and nearly doubled the standard deduction. It lowered tax rates across the board for owners of small- and medium-sized businesses, farms, and ranches. It lowered our Nation's massive corporate tax rate, which, up until January 1 of last year, was the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. It expanded business owners' ability to recover the costs of the investments they make in their businesses, which frees up cash that they can reinvest in their operations and in their workers. It also brought the U.S. international tax system into the 21st century so that American businesses would not be operating at a competitive disadvantage next to their foreign counterparts.  I am proud to report that the Republicans' economic policies are working. Our economy is thriving. The economy grew at a robust 3.4 percent in the third quarter of 2018. January marked the 11th straight month that unemployment has been at or below 4 percent. That is the longest streak in nearly five decades. The number of job openings hit a record high in December. Once again, there were more job openings than job seekers. In fact, job openings outnumbered job seekers by more than a million jobs. Think about that. There are more job openings than there are people who are looking for work. It is not just by a little but by a lot--by a million job openings.  The Department of Labor reports that the number of job openings has outnumbered the number of job seekers now for 10 straight months. Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a rate of 3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage growth reached this level was in 2009--a decade ago.  A Bloomberg article from yesterday reported:       A strong labor market is proving to be [a] blessing for job      switchers as they pocket bigger raises amid record openings.      Median wage growth for those who jumped to new positions      picked up to 4.6 percent in January from a year earlier--the      fastest pace since October of 2007.  Median household income is at an all-time, inflation-adjusted high of $61,372, and the list goes on.  These are a lot of statistics, but behind those numbers are American families whose lives are improving, thanks to Republican economic policies--American families who no longer have to choose between a car repair and a dentist's bill; American families who now have a little extra every month to put away for the kids' college or for their retirement. Thanks to Republican economic policies, Americans are feeling more optimistic and more hopeful about their futures.  Gallup reports: ``Americans' optimism about their personal finances has climbed to levels not seen in more than 16 years, with 69 percent now saying they expect to be financially better off `at this time next year.' ''  There are 57 percent of Americans who ``rate the economy as excellent or good,'' according to Gallup, which is the highest level since January of 2001.  There are 69 percent of Americans who say that now is a good time to find a quality job, which is the highest percentage that Gallup has ever recorded.  There is optimism in this country. There is optimism within families, and there is optimism within small businesses. There is optimism at every level when it comes to this economy and the jobs and the wages that are being created as a result of these economic policies.  When it came time to draft tax reform, we had hoped it could have been a bipartisan endeavor. After all, many of the ideas that we included were the product of both Republican and Democratic proposals. As someone who has been around tax policy for a number of years and had served as a member of the Senate Finance Committee when tax reform was written, I have seen many of the bills that have been introduced.  A few years ago, I led a task force that took ideas from both sides and incorporated them into a document that we put out there that provided for many of the ideas that were included in tax reform, and some of those were Democratic ideas. What happened, unfortunately, was that the Democrats were not over the 2016 election, and they absolutely refused to collaborate on tax reform legislation. Now they are trying to pretend that the economic progress we have made over the past 2 years doesn't exist.  In a recent tweet, one Democrat Presidential hopeful here in the Senate went so far as to actively mislead Americans about tax reform by falsely suggesting that tax reform raised taxes for the middle class when, instead, it lowered taxes for an estimated 90 percent of middle-class Americans. The Washington Post called her tweet ``nonsensical and misleading.'' Presumably, most Americans are well aware that the size of their tax refunds has nothing to do with the size of their tax bills.  That statement--made by a Democratic candidate for President--peddles a blatantly false narrative in the hopes of scoring political points, and for that statement, she was awarded four Pinocchios by the Washington Post, which is about as big a whopper as you can get. Luckily, no matter how much the Democrats try to pretend that our economy isn't improving, they can't hide the reality that Republican economic policies are making life better for American families.  I am proud of everything we have accomplished so far, and we are going to keep working to ensure that our economy can thrive for the long term and to make sure that every American will have access to a secure and prosperous future.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the government funding agreement announced last night. I greatly appreciate the work of Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy, and the Appropriations Committee in their efforts to reach a bipartisan agreement. I appreciate the efforts of Senator McConnell, Senator Schumer, and our House counterparts, as well, to reach an agreement.  I am glad we will avert another government shutdown and also make critical investments in several areas that are important to my home State of Minnesota; however, there is an important piece of unfinished business that wasn't included in the agreement, and that is to provide backpay for the employees of Federal contractors who were forced out of work for more than a month during the shutdown.  During the longest Federal shutdown in history, thousands of Americans who serve as contractors to the Federal Government lost over a month's pay through no fault of their own, and these are people who work as security guards and clean office buildings, and they work shoulder to shoulder with Federal employees for all of us. Unfortunately, and this is important, while Federal employees have received backpay--a bill this Chamber passed unanimously--their contractor counterparts have been left out in the cold with no backpay.  I have introduced legislation, which has bipartisan support, which would right this wrong, and it should have been included in the final budget deal, but it appears that the White House blocked it.  I have talked with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle here in the Senate Chamber, and I have not found a single person who says contractors don't deserve backpay. We all agree on this, and that is why every Democrat in this Chamber has cosponsored my bill, and that is why several of my Republican colleagues and many others in this room have not only cosponsored but have also expressed support for finding a solution to this challenge.  So why not provide backpay to contractors in the funding bill before us today? Because it appears the White House apparently has said not to do it. But I have talked to the White House just in the last week. I didn't hear any fundamental reasons why our plan couldn't go forward and why challenges couldn't be resolved.  While I don't claim to know the White House's motivation in opposing this bill, I do know there are several misconceptions about this legislation that I would like to address today.  First, some have claimed that the problem is just too complicated to solve or that it would involve an untested process, but that is not right.  My bill would allow Agencies to make what is called equitable adjustment to contract prices to compensate contractors who provide backpay to their furloughed employees. This equitable adjustment process is used regularly by contracting officers and contractors. It has already been used to address other shutdown-related claims, including hundreds of claims for shutdown-related compensation this year alone. This process has already been used to pay contractors, just not for backpay. So my bill would build on the existing processes already in place. These processes are established, and it is just not that complicated.  Second, some have claimed that the administrative costs of the bill would just be too large, and that is simply false.  It is true that Agencies would need to take administrative steps to implement the bill, just as they do with the passage of any legislation. But, again, my bill builds on an existing administrative process that is used regularly and efficiently without large administrative costs.  Let me be clear. If the White House or anyone has suggestions on ways to improve this legislation to make it easier to implement, we are all ears. We would be happy to accommodate any reasonable suggestion; we just haven't seen any. We haven't received any specific suggestions.  Too often, contractors are invisible to the public, but they suffered greatly during this recent shutdown. Representative Ayanna Pressley and I recently authored an op-ed about this, and it included a story about a woman named Tamela, whom we both met. We wrote in our op-ed:       Tamela was worried that she would fall behind on her      mortgage and car payments, ruining the good credit she'd      worked so long and so hard to build. And as she spoke, beads      of sweat rolled down her face. Was she nervous about speaking      in front of a crowd? No. As Tamela explained, she's diabetic      and has high blood pressure. Without her regular paycheck,      she hadn't been able to afford the co-pay for a doctor's      appointment to have her blood pressure tested and her      prescription renewed. So she was going without her medicine.  I recently received a letter from Annie, a Federal contractor in Duluth. Annie wrote to me:       I am losing wages that I count on each month to make      significant payments towards my student loans and      contributions to my savings, (including my retirement      savings). I can honestly say I never thought I'd be applying      for unemployment, especially as a 31-year-old, but today I      did just that.  These employees deserve backpay. They had nothing to do with creating this crisis, and we should all be able to come together in a bipartisan way to make sure these Federal contract employees receive backpay. So I stand here today to say I am going to continue working to get this bill passed, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find a path forward.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today we hope to vote on a bipartisan, bicameral agreement that will fully fund the government and provide additional measures to strengthen our border security.  I want to applaud all of the members of the conference committee who worked on this agreement. I particularly want to recognize those Senate Members, led by Chairman Shelby and Vice Chairman Leahy, for negotiating a bipartisan compromise that will keep the government's doors open. Neither side got everything they wanted--that is why it is called a compromise--but in the end, fully funding the government and keeping it open is what is best for the American people.  What we saw during the 35-day government shutdown was that it took a terrible toll on our Federal workers, and it cost the U.S. economy $11 billion--including $3 billion that is gone forever, according to the Congressional Budget Office.  Across the country, Federal workers have been very anxiously waiting to see if we were going to come to an agreement, if they were going to be able to pay their mortgages, afford groceries, and get their prescriptions. Well, today, hopefully we can put their minds at ease. We can pass this legislation, and hopefully the President will sign it, because failure to do so would once again deprive Americans of important government services and throw our economy into a tailspin.  I urge all of our colleagues in Congress to take up this funding legislation, to pass it, and the President to sign it as soon as it reaches his desk.  Protecting our borders should not be an exercise in partisanship, and I am glad to see that this bill supports commonsense investments that focus on the technology, infrastructure, and personnel that are needed at the southern and northern borders to provide actual security that works.  The bill provides $1.375 billion for targeted fencing in vulnerable areas along the southern border and more than $800 million for Border Patrol agents, better surveillance and screening technologies, and increased security at our ports of entry. When resourced and deployed appropriately, these types of smart investments are far more likely to interrupt the flow of narcotics than a costly and ineffective border wall.  Importantly, the legislation also includes $77 million for opioid equipment and staffing to interdict fentanyl and other synthetic opioids that are shipped through international mail and express consignment facilities. This is particularly important to States like mine, New Hampshire, where we have the second highest overdose death rate from opioids in the country. So many of those deaths are caused by the synthetic fentanyl. The opioid epidemic is a true national emergency, and Federal investments like these are needed to stop the illegal flow of these drugs into the country.  When Congress takes up and passes this deal, it will not only pass the appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security but also six other appropriations bills that have unfortunately been waylaid by our shutdown. This appropriations package supports critical Federal investments across all government Agencies, and I want to highlight just a few of those, starting with the programs funded in the bipartisan Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2019.  As ranking member of the CJS Subcommittee, I worked closely with my colleague Senator Moran from Kansas, who chairs the subcommittee, and we crafted what I believe is a truly bipartisan bill that will promote the economy, protect the American people, and secure our Nation's leadership in science and innovation.  For example, the fiscal year 2019 CJS bill provides $468 million in dedicated Justice Department grant programs to tackle the opioid epidemic. The legislation will provide funding to State and local governments and those organizations working on the frontlines--providing a balanced approach of law enforcement, treatment, and recovery resources to help our communities that are dealing with opioid and fentanyl deaths. This amount is $21 million higher than the fiscal year 2018 level and $336 million higher than the President's budget request. For communities desperately fighting opioid addiction, any further delay in funding is dangerous and could be deadly, so it is critical that we pass this bill today.  Importantly, the legislation also contains the highest funding level ever for the Office on Violence Against Women--$497.5 million for critical programs that provide training for police officers and prosecutors, rape prevention programs, and funding for women's shelters.  While I am glad that the appropriations package provides funding for these Violence Against Women Act programs, more work needs to be done to better support survivors of domestic and sexual violence. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the complex issue of domestic violence.  The appropriations package also supports investments in our national infrastructure and provides more than $49 billion to the Federal Highway Administration to modernize our highways and repair our bridges.  This legislation would also provide a $1.3 billion increase for housing programs like rental assistance and homeless support services. For us in New Hampshire, that means that 9,500 low-income households will continue to have a place they can call home.  I am pleased that the appropriations package includes a 1.9-percent pay increase for Federal civilian employees. This is a cost-of-living increase that is long overdue.  During the shutdown, I had a chance to meet with a number of our Federal workers, and one of the things that impressed me the most was the dedication those workers had to their jobs and to serving the people of this country. They were going to work without getting paid and without knowing when they were going to get paid. Yet they showed up every day because of their commitment to the people of this country.  In addition to passing this appropriations package, Congress should take further action to provide financial security to Federal employees and contractors. We just heard our colleague Tina Smith talking about the importance of providing the pay to those people who so far are not slated to get backpay. I have cosponsored legislation to secure backpay for the Federal contractor employees, including janitorial, food, and security service workers who were furloughed or forced to accept reduced work hours as a result of the shutdown. I hope we in Congress will take up and pass the bills Senator Smith outlined as soon as possible.  I know you know this, Mr. President, because we have talked about it, but Americans are tired of partisanship. They expect their elected officials to work together to come to a bipartisan compromise and to do what is good for the country, and I couldn't agree more.  The Senate will soon consider an appropriations package to supply Federal investments for programs that support national defense, small businesses, conservation of public lands, food assistance for low-income families, and so much more. This package also includes compromised proposals to improve our border security.  I hope that we will pass this package this afternoon and that the President will sign this legislation into law as soon as it passes the House.  Federal workers are dedicated to serving the American people, and they have families to care for. They should never again be used as pawns. We should never again use shutting down the Federal Government as an excuse over disagreements over policy issues. It is time for our elected leaders to move away from the partisan politics and to live up to the expectations of our constituents. Let's fund the government, and let's do it today."

I have carefully reviewed his record, listened to his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and questioned him for an hour in my office. Given the significant issues before the Department of Justice and the fact that it is currently led by an unconfirmed, Acting Attorney General, I will vote to confirm Mr. Barr.  It is imperative that the Senate confirm an Attorney General who is committed to allowing the Special Counsel to complete his investigation unimpeded. Mr. Barr gave this commitment under oath to the Judiciary Committee and again to me in our private meeting. He testified clearly that he will not permit any interference in Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. In fact, Mr. Barr told the committee that he believes ``the overarching public interest is to allow [Special Counsel Mueller] to finish.'' He also said he would resign if he were ordered by the President to fire the Special Counsel without good cause. Mr. Barr testified, ``The country needs a credible resolution to these issues, and if confirmed, I will not permit partisan politics, personal interests, or any other improper consideration to interfere with this or any other investigation. I will follow the Special Counsel regulations scrupulously and in good faith, and on my watch, Bob [Mueller] will be allowed to finish his work.''  Not only must the Special Counsel be allowed to finish his work, but also his conclusions must be as open and transparent to the public as possible. The Special Counsel regulations, put in place during the Clinton administration, have guided administrations from both parties for two decades. Those regulations instruct the Special Counsel to submit a confidential report to the Attorney General, and Mr. Barr testified that he will be as transparent as possible about the report, consistent with the law. He told me he will always err on the side of disclosure and believes transparency is critical to the public's confidence in the investigation. When asked whether he would allow the President or his attorneys to edit any report, Mr. Barr told the committee, ``That will not happen.''  Mr. Barr and I also discussed the memo he wrote in 2018 about obstruction of justice and his views on executive power. I asked him whether suborning perjury would be obstruction. He said yes. I asked him what he would do if the President asked him to stop an otherwise lawful investigation. He said he would resign. We discussed the political checks that exist to limit Executive power, and he described the Special Counsel as a ``super charged political check.''  Some have suggested, however, that Mr. Barr's memo means he believes the President cannot obstruct justice at all. In a letter to Chairman Graham, Mr. Barr responded: ``Quite the contrary, [the memo] expressed my belief that a President, just like anyone else, can obstruct justice if he or she engages in wrongful actions that impair the availability of evidence. Nor did the memorandum claim, as some have incorrectly suggested, that a President can never obstruct justice whenever he or she is exercising a constitutional function. If a President, acting with the requisite intent, engages in the kind of evidence impairment the statute prohibits--regardless whether it involves the exercise of his or her constitutional powers or not--then a President commits obstruction of justice under the statute. It is as simple as that.''  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein has said publicly that Mr. Barr's memo had no impact on the investigation. Mr. Rosenstein also noted, ``Lots of people offer opinions to the Department of Justice, but they don't influence our own decision making.''  Mr. Barr's views on executive power, while legitimate, differ from my own and do concern me as a member of the legislative branch. His opinions highlight the tension that sometimes emerges among the branches of government and which is rooted in the separation of powers. On any given matter, I would likely argue for a more limited approach to Executive power. Regardless of his philosophy, Mr. Barr has noted correctly that the President is not above the law.  Mr. Barr brings considerable experience to bear on important legal policy matters at the DOJ. He testified that he supports efforts to protect the civil rights of LGBT individuals and that he is against discrimination against anyone on account of their gender identity or sexual orientation. He further stated that he is willing to support ``red flag laws'' as a step toward preventing gun violence.  Mr. Barr offered his commitment to implementing the newly enacted FIRST STEP Act, a bill I supported and that he described as one that ``recognizes the progress we have made over the past three decades in fighting violent crime.'' Mr. Barr is also committed to combating scams and fraudulent schemes that target seniors, which, as chairman of the Senate Aging Committee, I have investigated and urged the Department to prioritize.  Finally, Mr. Barr has served our country previously with distinction. One hundred and twenty former officials and employees from various administrations have praised Mr. Barr's ``character of unwavering commitment to the rule of law without regard to favor or politics.'' His nomination is supported by many leaders from the law enforcement community, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association. In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Barr pledged to run the Department of Justice with professionalism and integrity. He noted that the President did not seek any promises from him and that he made none to the President.  Mr. Barr has pledged his allegiance to the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American people. He has served our country honorably in the past, and I believe he will do so once again."

After meeting with Mr. Barr, I am convinced he is a qualified candidate and is committed to upholding our constitutional liberties.  Mr. Barr's record of achievement and civil service to our country stretches back over 30 years. Early in his career, he served as an intelligence analyst at the CIA and an assistant attorney general in the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel. He was later appointed Deputy Attorney General in the George H.W. Bush administration before becoming our 77th United States Attorney General. Mr. Barr's suitability for the role of attorney general has been tested before; in fact, he has excelled in that capacity.  Concerns have been raised regarding Mr. Barr's position with respect to the Second Amendment. Wyoming is a State of gunowners, and I am a strong defender of our Second Amendment rights, so naturally I probed these concerns. I had the opportunity to personally meet with Mr. Barr and directly ask him about his stance on the Second Amendment. He gave me direct answers and made it clear that he does not support limiting our Second Amendment rights.  Ultimately, the Constitution solely grants Congress power of law-making. I am prepared to work with my Senate colleagues to protect against any efforts that would undermine our constitutional rights, and I will continue to conduct congressional oversight on the executive branch, a duty I take very seriously."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise to vote against William Barr's nomination to serve as Attorney General. Although Mr. Barr has served as Attorney General in the past, I do not believe he is the right candidate to lead the Department of Justice at this time.  Americans are facing unprecedented times. The President fired former FBI Director James Comey to circumvent and frustrate a Federal investigation. Former Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe confirmed today that he opened an investigation into the President himself regarding his potential ties to Russia after Comey's firing. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump and his campaign for collusion and Russian interference in the 2016 Presidential elections. Some of the President's close confidants have been indicted, pled guilty and are cooperating with the Special Counsel. Yesterday, a judge ruled that President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, lied to Federal investigators about his interactions with Russians during the campaign.  During this tumultuous time, Americans need an Attorney General who values transparency, who is independent, and who can stand up to a President who has shown repeatedly that he believes that the Attorney General of the United States is his personal attorney and not the attorney of the American people. After closely following Barr's nomination hearing and analyzing his record, I do not believe he will stand up to the President and effectively lead the Department.  Before Barr was formally nominated to be Attorney General, he wrote and distributed a 19-page memo where he characterized the Mueller investigation as ``fatally misconceived'' with ``potentially disastrous implications not just for the Presidency, but for the Executive branch as a whole and for the Department in particular.'' Barr wrote this memo well aware that his knowledge of the facts surrounding the Mueller probe is severely limited to public reporting.  Nevertheless, Barr concluded that Trump's publicly reported interactions with former FBI Director James Comey could not constitute obstruction of justice and sent the memo to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, Assistant Attorney General Steve Engel, the Solicitor General, White House Special Counsel, Jared Kushner's attorney, and Donald Trump's personal attorneys. He made certain that everyone in Trump's orbit knew his name and knew about this memo.  This behavior should alarm not only Senators but every American. Former FBI Director Comey testified under oath that President Trump said to him, ``I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.'' President Trump publicly railed against former Attorney General Sessions for following the guidance of Department of Justice ethics officials and recusing himself from anything pertaining to the Russia investigation. During his confirmation hearing, Barr would not commit to following the advice of career ethics officials at DOJ if they recommend that he recuse himself from the Russia investigation to avoid any appearance of conflicts of interest. Instead, he said that he would rely on his own judgment. Mr. Barr is essentially asking Senators to trust him and his judgment. Why should Senators trust his judgment when there are systems and processes in place that were created for this exact circumstance? Mr. Barr cannot call himself an institutionalist concerned with maintaining the rule of law while seemingly being unwilling to submit to the rule of law when it applies to him.  It is not surprising that the President would select as his next Attorney General someone who not only refuses to recuse himself from the investigation but also believes that elements of Mueller's probe are ``fatally misconceived.''  Finally, during his confirmation hearing, Barr was repeatedly pressed by Republicans and Democrats on whether or not he would agree to release the final Mueller report in its entirety. Barr would not commit to do so. I believe that the report should be made available not only to Members of Congress but to all Americans so that they can see the evidence for themselves and reach their own conclusions. If we want Americans to trust their judicial system, we must insist on transparency and honesty.  Beyond those issues, I am concerned about Mr. Barr's commitment to civil rights. During his confirmation hearing, he seemed ignorant about the disparate treatment between Whites and Blacks in our criminal justice system. When he served as Attorney General under President George W. Bush, he advocated for policies that have in turn led to mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders. In 2015, he publicly opposed the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, bipartisan legislation that would have reduced Federal mandatory minimums, and required the Bureau of Prisons to provide more rehabilitative programming to prisoners.  Last year, Congress passed the First Step Act with broad bipartisan support. The First Step Act included similar provisions to the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act. The First Step Act will not be successful without direction from the Attorney General. I intend to use my position on the Appropriations Committee to hold Barr accountable and to make sure he is proactively implementing this law.  Americans deserve to have an Attorney General who is loyal to the office and not to the President. I do not believe Mr. Barr is that Attorney General."

                "speech":"Mr. President, it is no secret that the 116th Congress got off to a rocky start as we tried to address the ongoing partial shutdown. Despite that, I remain optimistic that we can work together to get things done for the American people.  Those looking for an example of how to find common ground should look no further than the important work Congress has done, and continues to do, for our veterans. The hearing room of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is traditionally one of the most bipartisan places in Washington. It is also one of the busiest.  Last Congress, under Chairman Isakson's leadership, we held 30 hearings, considered 56 pieces of legislation, and sent to the full Senate 17 of President Trump's nominees to serve our veterans.  That spirit of cooperation continued here on the floor. During the last session of Congress, the Senate passed 23 major pieces of veteran-related legislation. As a result, the President signed into law bills that significantly enhance healthcare, education, retirement, and other benefits for our veterans.  I want to talk briefly about two of the more notable measures--the VA MISSION Act and the Forever GI bill--to underscore why it is so important for Congress to operate in a collaborative manner. Bipartisan oversight of the Departments and Agencies that implement the laws we pass in that Chamber is critical to ensuring that the executive branch follows the intent of Congress. These two laws highlight just how important that is.  Let's start with the VA MISSION Act. This law was passed to replace the Veterans Choice Act, which was created in response to the VA Health Administration scandal of 2014. This was a good first step. The Choice Program addressed many shortcomings within the VA system. However, my colleagues and I quickly learned it had its own share of troubles. Specifically, we heard repeated stories of difficulties navigating the complex and confusing bureaucratic process. Despite the new reforms, many veterans were still facing unacceptably long wait times at VA medical centers. Through our oversight of the Choice Program, we recognized that more needed to be done to strengthen and streamline VA healthcare services and its community care programs. That was the genesis of the VA MISSION Act. One of the key reforms in the VA MISSION Act is that it enables veterans to seek quality healthcare services in their own communities, whether inside the VA system or from a private sector provider.  Specifically, the law requires the Department to establish access and quality standards that will be used as the framework for the VA and the veteran to decide when to get care in a VA facility and when to get care in the community. If the VA is unable to meet certain designated access standards, veterans will be given the option to receive care in the community. Last week, the VA announced the proposed new access standards to determine a veteran's eligibility for the community care that will take effect this June.  I am pleased that the VA maintained the spirit of the law in its proposed access standards. We understood that by providing additional access to community healthcare resources, there would be an added cost. As chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the VA, the entire committee will be closely working with the Department and my colleagues. Together, we will have the responsibility of making sure that the allocation of resources to support veterans' healthcare is spent wisely.  Oversight is also crucial to uncover negligence on the part of the Agencies charged with implementing the law. This is exactly what happened when the VA failed to fully comply with the housing stipend rates set by the Forever GI bill.  Passage of the initial GI bill after World War II was seen as a turning point in the way our Nation treated those who have served. The program is designed to give service men and women the building blocks they needed to succeed after leaving the military. The problem is, those building blocks have changed in the 70-plus years since the GI bill was first instituted. Since then, Congress modernized the GI bill when it passed the post 9/11 GI bill. After 17 years of war, it was once again time for an update.  The Harry W. Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act--also known as the Forever GI bill--brings educational benefits to veterans so that they can receive them in this modern era. It became apparent, however, that the VA was implementing key provisions of the law incorrectly. When Secretary Wilkie testified before the VA Committee last September, I pressed him about the Department's failure to fully award the housing allowances for more than 340,000 Forever GI bill beneficiaries.  According to the statute, the VA should have used the Department of Defense's 2018 basic allowance for housing rates. This should have been calculated based on the ZIP Code where the student takes the majority of classes, rather than on the ZIP Code in which the school's main campus is located. Instead, some GI bill recipients were receiving housing stipends at the 2017 rate and based on the school's ZIP Code. This was clearly unacceptable.  Once it was evident that the VA was not following the statute, Congress had an obligation to act. That is why Senator Schatz and I introduced the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act to demand an immediate fix from the VA. That bill became law within a matter of weeks from its introduction.  With this law, what we are asking of the VA is really threefold. The first is to make every unpaid or underpaid veteran whole. The second is to be accountable for the errors that have happened and prevent them from recurring in the future. The third is to fix the problems to prevent them from recurring so that we will not go through this problem again. It is promising to see that the VA has begun to carry out some of the requirements that have been dictated in the Forever GI Bill Housing Payment Fulfillment Act.  The VA recently announced the members of the tiger team that the VA is required to assemble per the statute. For those who are unfamiliar with the term, a tiger team is a team of specialists tasked to achieve a specific goal. In this case, it is comprised of six senior benefits and IT officials at the VA who will be tasked with providing Congress a detailed plan to correct this egregious error. Hopefully, the move to quickly establish this team is reflective of the seriousness with which the Department takes this mandate. It is frustrating that it has taken another act of Congress to get to this point, but all of us are committed to ensuring that the VA follows the law as written.  In a spirit of cooperation, the leadership of the congressional committees who oversee the Department recently sent a letter to Secretary Wilkie to request that the VA work collaboratively with Congress throughout the implementation process. This message was echoed during a recent subcommittee hearing I chaired about the VA's implementation of a modern, commercial, electronic health record. It is important to ensure that the VA is able to share information with the Department of Defense and community healthcare providers while it undertakes the largest health record modernization project in the Nation's history. With all of the reforms getting underway simultaneously, it is vital for the VA to share information openly, even predecisional information, so that we can work together and have a common understanding of the impact of changes, including costs, and can assess the challenges that may arise.  The laws we pass in this Chamber are a key part of our legacy, but our oversight responsibilities are of equal importance. The bipartisan manner in which the Veterans' Affairs Committee works to uphold that oversight responsibility sets an excellent example for the rest of Washington to follow.  We appreciate the hard work of Secretary Wilkie and that of his team and all of those in the VA system who work so very hard on behalf of our Nation's veterans. In working together, we can ensure that veterans receive the benefits they deserve and were promised.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":" I thank the Presiding Officer.  Mr. President, from time to time, I come to the floor of the Senate to share with my colleagues stories of the victims of gun violence. I had hoped the statistics that consistently show this country has a gun violence rate that is 10 to 20 times higher than those of other similar high-income nations--data that shows this continuing epidemic of mass slaughter during which we average a mass shooting almost every day--would have compelled my colleagues to action. It hasn't. So I have tried to come down to the floor as often as I can to explain who these people are and to explain the genius that has been lost from this world when lives are cut so short by gun violence--gun violence that is largely preventable in this country.  I come to the floor with an unusually heavy heart because I want to talk about some of the lives that were lost a year ago today at the shooting in Parkland, FL, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. It was a year ago that I was actually walking to the floor to give a speech on immigration when I learned of another mass shooting. It hits hard for those of us who represent Connecticut because we are still working through the ripples of grief that never ever disappear in a community that has been shattered by an episode of catastrophic gun violence--in our case, in Sandy Hook, CT.  In February of last year, 17 students and teachers were gunned down in their classrooms at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. One of them was Peter Wang.  Peter was 15 years old. He was a U.S. Army Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps cadet. He was getting ready to celebrate the Chinese New Year with his family. His two younger siblings and many other friends called him a natural leader.  When the shooter entered the high school, Peter had a choice to make: He could run and protect himself or he could try to help his fellow students in need. He chose the latter. He chose to hold a door open to help his classmates escape. He saved other people's lives while he lost his own.  Classmate Jared Burns said: ``For as long as we remember him, he is a hero.''  ``He yanked open a door that allowed dozens of classmates, teachers and staffers to escape,'' officials said.  His middle school basketball coach said that he was just a ``joyful person.'' His sacrifice, according to his coach, ``just made perfect sense'' because he was that selfless.  Peter was posthumously accepted to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point for his heroic actions on that day.  Alex Schachter was a freshman who played the trombone and baritone in the marching band, and he loved to play basketball. He loved music so much that in middle school, he took two band classes so that he could get ready to join the marching band in high school, which was his dream. His Eagle Regiment Marching Band actually won the State championship in Tampa.  His dad said that he was just a sweetheart of a kid. He said that he just wanted to do well to make his parents' happy.  His dream was to attend the University of Connecticut. He told everybody. He was only a freshman, but he knew where he was going to college. He wanted to go to my State, to Connecticut. He wore a UConn sweatshirt almost every single day to school. His favorite song was an old one by Chicago, ``25 or 6 to 4,'' which is kind of an odd choice for a 14-year-old. Yet UConn's band actually chose to play that song at halftime at one of UConn's football games, and UConn admitted Alex posthumously because his dream was to be a UConn Husky.  Helena Ramsay was full of laughter and had this infectious smile. She was 17 when she was shot that day. She loved all kinds of music, although she was mostly into K-pop. She had all sorts of other interests too. She was interested in human rights and the environment. She joined the school's United Nations Club and the Christian faith-based First Priority Group. She was always looking out for her friends.  One of her friends said: ``When I was stressed out from my chemistry lab that I thought I was going to fail, she calmed me down and told me that it was going to be OK.''  One of her best friends said that she was ``one of the kindest people I've ever met.''  When the gunman walked into her classroom, she turned to her friend to make sure that her friend was safe and told her to shield herself with books. People described it as a ``moment of bravery in the face of horror.''  Another hero that day was Aaron Feis. He was an assistant football coach, and he was a security guard. He threw himself in front of his kids. That is how he died that day.  The football program's spokesperson said:       [Aaron] died the same way he lived--he put himself second.      . . . He was a very kind soul, a very nice man. He died a      hero.  One of his football players who had been going through leukemia treatments remembered that Aaron had guided him through those treatments.       He would send me prayers. He would send me Bible scripts      and just stuff to cheer up my day.  Aaron died while protecting the kids at that school.  These 4 stories are amongst those of the 17 people who died at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Yet 93 people die every day from gun violence. Most of those are suicides. A bunch of them are homicides. Others are accidental shootings, but they are all preventable.  As we remember today the mass shooting at Parkland, it is important that even on those days on which nobody puts up on cable news a mass shooting, there are still somewhere around 90 people who die every day, and I will tell you about one of them.  Corey Dodd was 25 years old when he died last month in Baltimore, MD. That morning, he told Marissa, his wife, to stay home and rest with their 3-year-old and their 3-week-old while he took the 5-year-old twins to school. After he dropped the twins off at school and pulled up outside their home, he was shot to death. The 3-year-old was inside. Marissa had to tell her kids that Daddy wasn't coming home.  She said:       I've told the kids that Daddy is done. He's not coming      back.  Their family was planning to move because Corey was looking for work, and they were going to move to wherever he found work. He had recently finished a program to earn his commercial driver's license. Things were looking up for Corey and Marissa and their four kids.  I didn't know Corey, but I know something about his death because I happened to be in Baltimore on that day. I happened to be at Corey's kids' school at the moment he was shot. I was inside that school when an announcement came over the loud speaker that there was a code green. I didn't know what a code green meant. A few minutes later, I found out that it is what happens inside schools in Baltimore when there is a shooting in the neighborhood. They locked down the school and our classroom and pulled down the shades, and we turned off the lights. A few minutes later, the police notified us that the scene was clear, that the school was safe, and that the day could go on. Yet, unbeknownst to me, just down the hall from me inside that school were two twins whose father had been shot blocks away from that school. Their lives will never be the same.  Part of the reason we care so much about this epidemic is that it is not just the victims; it is also about the people who are left behind. Imagine going to an elementary school in which you fear for your life when you walk to and from school and where parents of your friends are shot at 10:30 in the morning. It changes their brains, the trauma these kids go through in a school like that. It makes their little, tiny, developing brains unable to learn. There is a biological process that actually happens to these kids. That trauma is what Parkland has been going through for the last year, and that trauma is what kids in Baltimore, New Haven, Hartford, Chicago, and New Orleans go through every single day. We are ruining millions of children all across this country because of an epidemic that we could choose to solve, that we could choose to do something about.  This week, the House of Representatives had a hearing and a meeting to move forward with a universal background checks bill that is supported by 97 percent of Americans. It will pass the House of Representatives, with Republican and Democratic support, with flying colors. Do you know what that tells us? It tells us that the most important thing we could do to save lives, to cut down on the 93 people who are killed every day, is to pass that universal background checks bill. In States that have universal background checks, there is about 30 percent less gun crime and fewer gun homicides than in States that don't have those universal background checks.  As we remember 1 year since the massacre at Parkland and as we strive to understand that this is an epidemic that takes 90 people every day, know that it is within our power to do something about it. We can't eliminate every single gun death. We can't stop every suicide or every homicide, but with commonsense legislation that is supported by 97 percent of Americans, we can make a big difference, and we can send a signal to would-be shooters who are contemplating violence that they should not interpret our silence as a quiet endorsement. It is up to us.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, one of the reasons why I continue to be here in Washington rather than visiting with family and friends of Congressman Jones is that we have a very important vote that we expect the Senate to take up here sometime this afternoon.  It is a vote that is borne out of compromise. To quote Winston Churchill--I think it was--it is the worst possible option except for all the other options considered up to this point.  It is not perfect, but it is important that we get the votes and that we encourage the President to sign this bill into law.  Now, I walked through the hallway this morning, and I had the press come up to me. Some in the press probably want to report honestly, but others want to create a narrative.  So the latest narrative is this: Senator, how do you feel about a bill that just got published last night--1,200 pages--and you are going to be asked to vote on it today?  I told them, specifically, because I have been following this measure since the last Congress. I said: Are you referring to the almost-1,200-page bill, of which all but 41 pages were matters that were taken up in the Appropriations Committee, voted out of committee unanimously in all but one case and with 26 votes in the other case? Are you referring to that bill?  If the Senators are doing their job and the Congressmen are doing their job, they read that months ago when they were passed out of the Appropriations Committee. Most of this is not new information. About 41 pages of it relates to the compromise that ultimately--because we couldn't get a compromise back in December--resulted in the government shutdown.  It absolutely funds some of the President's priorities for border security. There are people that get caught up on either end of the spectrum. It reminds me of how my kids used to fight in the back of the minivan when we used to take them on vacations. It is a childish argument: It is a wall.  No, it is not.  It is a wall.  No, it is not.  Look, it is steps taken forward in a positive way for border security. It is a structure that makes sense. It is technology. It is personnel. It is what we need to ultimately secure the border.  Some people can call it a wall because you could argue that in total it is. Other people could say it is not a wall. I don't care as long as you ultimately recognize that voting for this measure and sending the signal to the President that we have his back, that we understand his priorities, and that we will continue to work on other measures on a bipartisan basis makes sense.  So I intend to support it today. It is not a vote that I am going to enjoy, but sometimes we have to do things here to make progress, to compromise, and to move on. We owe it to the American people to keep the government open. We owe it to border security to listen to their recommendations to fund people, technology, and infrastructure. This is a step in the right direction."

One is that in the 12 years that I have been in public service, I have virtually spent none of those Valentine's Days at home. Last year, I was thinking about how I messed up. I didn't even order flowers or do the things that I would normally do, although, I usually get flowers on Valentine's Day.  But then I started contemplating the Senate rules, and I know that there are a number of, well, things you just can't do on the floor.  I determined, for example, that you can't do an ad hoc prop and say something because it would be a violation of the rules. So although I thought about putting this heart up and presenting this and saying, ``I love my wife Susan Tillis of 32 years,'' I am not going to do that because I think it would be a violation of the rules.  But in the event that someday we do change the rules and we are able to come to the floor and express our love for our spouses and people who sacrifice as much as we do, I hope someday to be able to give that speech on the Senate floor.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to talk about an experience I had this weekend that was extremely memorable to me.  I used to live in Texas. I used to be involved in businesses in the Valley, as they call it there--from Brownsville to Weslaco, to Edinburg, to McCowan. This past weekend, a good colleague of mine, Senator Steve Daines from Montana, and I traveled to the southern border to visit the Customs and Border Patrol people, to visit with ICE people, and to see firsthand what goes on in a typical night. We were there overnight on Sunday night. We had a remarkable evening, and we saw firsthand what these people are up against.  Before I make my comments, I want to say that from Deputy Chief Ortiz all the way down in the organization in that sector--the McCowan sector that we were in--the best of America is in uniform right now, every day and night, protecting our rights and privileges here in the United States. I was proud to meet these people and to be a part of this trip.  What we saw this weekend is disturbing on many levels. We spoke directly to Border Patrol agents. We went to the retention center. We saw firsthand that we have not just illegal immigration there, but we have a national security crisis. We saw it firsthand.  This is a situation that the border agents face every day, and it is a grim situation. It is shameful that we here in Congress have not given Border Patrol agents adequate resources to do their jobs.  First, the real tragedy at the border is the dramatic increase in illegal drug trafficking. Even though the conversation in this room deals mainly with illegal immigration across that border, in this sector, the drug traffic increases are remarkable.  This year alone, fiscal year 2018--this is from October 1 to today--we had a 22-percent increase of heroin seized at the southern border, a 38-percent increase of methamphetamine and a 73-percent increase in fentanyl.  The amount of fentanyl seized by ICE so far this year is enough to kill every American citizen by overdose. Let me say that again. The tonnage of fentanyl seized is up 73 percent this year across the entire southern border, and that is not 100 percent of what is crossing that border. That is a 73-percent increase over the last year. The tonnage that has been seized this year is enough to kill every American citizen by overdose.  What is so remarkable is the estimate that only 7 to 10 percent of the drugs that they are attempting to bring across the border are actually interdicted--less than 10 percent. That is consistent with what our SOUTHCOM combatant commander tells us repeatedly year after year. By the end of fiscal year 2019, CPB--Customs and Border Patrol--will have seized 1.7 million pounds of narcotics at the border.  The Border Patrol agents we spoke to estimate that they are only able to stop, again, about 10 percent, and that is because they don't have the resources.  The movement of drugs from Mexico to the United States at the southern border is the greatest drug threat to our country. These drugs pouring across the border are destroying communities across the Nation. Congress has to act to give these Border Patrol agents and our ICE agents the infrastructure they need to address this dramatic spike in illegal drug trafficking.  I know that the illegal immigration topic is a hot topic. I don't disagree with that, but we are not talking about this at the level that we should.  We have had historic opioid legislation. I was a supporter of that. Now we need to move on and make sure we secure the southern border.  The second point I want to make is that agents on the ground told us how Mexican drug cartels just across the border use migrants--illegal immigrants coming up out of Central America--to camouflage what they are doing and to distract our border agents from the real war that is going on, and that is the intrusion of illegal drugs into the country.  The cartels charge a toll for every individual who comes through their area of control. It is amazing right now. The charge is $8,000 per person. There are some estimates that this toll business on illegal immigrants coming across the southern border is somewhere around $2.1 billion in revenue for the cartels. These are the illegal cartels just south of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. This doesn't account for the billions of dollars these cartels earn from the drug trade every year, which is a primary business.  There are some estimates that the $2 billion they get in tolls for illegal immigrants coming into the United States is overshadowed by tenfold, relative to the drug trade. Some estimates are $25 to $30 billion of first cost value in revenue from the drugs that are coming across that border.  Many of the illegal immigrants being exploited by these cartels are unaccompanied children and family units. We met some of these people. It breaks your heart. The number of these to claim asylum has surged at our southern border since 2014. This massive surge is due to loopholes in our asylum and immigration laws.  These laws allow unaccompanied minors and family units to easily assert broad asylum claims. Again, the number of family units, individuals with children, and unaccompanied children has skyrocketed over the last 5 years.  Due to certain provisions in the law and court rulings currently enforced, these children and individuals are released into the United States while they are theoretically waiting for their formal removal proceedings to begin months or years down the road.  These loopholes, combined with programs like DACA, have led to a staggering increase in the number of unaccompanied children and family units at the border.  In fiscal year 2019 to date, there is a 280-percent increase in the number of family units apprehended at the border compared to the same point in fiscal year 2018. From just 1 year ago, there is a 280-percent increase.  The monthly apprehension numbers we are currently seeing even surpass those during the Obama administration. I think this chart shows it best. We see what happened over here, in blue, under the last administration. This is a dramatic increase in the number of illegal apprehensions at the southern border, primarily driven by catch-and-release and the implementation of some of these loopholes we are talking about right now. That was a dramatic increase--more than a 2 1/2  times increase--250 percent in just 8 years.  The word got out that the new President, who was elected in November--right here--said: Well, we are going to enforce the law. They began to do that, and we saw a dramatic decrease in illegal immigrants coming across the border--a dramatic decrease.  Then there was a court case that said: Well, you can't really do that. That court case is being appealed, and what we have seen since then is that the cartels are back in business. This is one measure of the drug trade that we don't talk about. These are the poor souls who are coming across our border illegally right now.  By the way, we are at a point now that is higher than at the peak during the Obama administration. People say: Well, you know, we don't have a crisis here. It is not a problem. Well, the numbers are down.  I don't know what numbers they are looking at, but these are the numbers. These are facts. I believe right now we have a full-blown crisis at the southern border.  I am not trying to define how we use money to put up a border wall or anything. That is not what I am trying to do in this speech. What I am trying to do is point out that we have a full-blown crisis of illegal immigrants and illegal drugs crossing the southern border. I saw it firsthand on patrol with our border agents over the weekend. I am contrasting that with years ago, when I used to go across that same border, when this was not a crisis.  The last four Presidents have built 654 miles of barriers. We saw some of it in this sector. They have built 654 miles of barriers. Now we have 2,000 miles of total southern border. The four Presidents--from George H. W. Bush all the way to President Obama--have built border barriers because they all agreed that this is a crisis. It was intended to stop or slow down drug trafficking and the illegal incursion of illegal immigrants.  President Obama built 135 miles. President Trump has 124 miles under construction right now. What we have been talking about here in the last few weeks is just 55 miles; we heard today it is an additional 55 miles.  The question is, Do these barriers work? Well, we have three areas where, over the last 30 years, border barriers have been built--San Diego, Tucson, El Paso--and we have actual numbers to show that the illegal crossing of drugs and illegal immigrants in those sectors where those barriers were put up dropped 95 percent. But what they have done is, they have pushed this traffic to areas that don't have those barriers. One of those was the McCowan district, which we visited this weekend.  There are 250 miles of border across 19 counties. It is a crisis down there. Right now, what we have there is 55 miles of barrier with 35 gaps in it. They have 55 miles that were built in 2006 in this sector. It is totally ineffective. The quickest thing we could do in that sector is close the 35 gaps. There were supposed to be gates, but there are no gates there. There is some litigation regarding that, but we need to fix that and make that barrier effective.  The U.S. Capitol Police--who do such an outstanding job protecting Members of Congress, our staffs, the Capitol building, and several blocks around every day--employs about 2,000 officers. The Metropolitan Police Department here in Washington has over 4,000 employees to help protect an area of 68 square miles.  Let's put that in perspective. There are 55 miles of barrier with 35 miles of gaps in it, and only 3,000 agents in that entire sector. I think you can see where the problem might be.  We have to give these men and women the tools they need to be successful and to protect our country. The longer we wait to take action, the more money cartels will make off drug trafficking, the more people will die, the more families will be destroyed, and the longer our communities will be in danger.  Some estimates show that my home State of Georgia has over 70,000 gang members in it--70,000. It is a destination for these people.  There were Hondurans who were apprehended that night while we were on patrol. We asked them where they were going. One said New York; one said Miami; and one said Woodstock, GA.  As we continue to debate this issue, I want to say clearly and unequivocally that Congress has to do better. We all must do better. For the men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our Nation's border, we must do better for our country.  We can start by passing disaster funding for the people in Georgia and other States who are hurting from historic hurricanes and fires. It is outrageous that the funding package being considered here today does nothing to help these farmers and victims of these wildfires out west and of the hurricanes in the southeast.  When President Trump came to Georgia to tour the damage after the hurricane, he said:       Farmers really got hurt, especially in Georgia, but we're      going to get it taken care of.  Vice President Pence said:       We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We will      restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region      bigger and better than ever before.  We have a moment right now in time where Congress needs to act. Today we have to get this funding done and move forward. We have to get this disaster relief, I think, moved forward in a supplemental, if that is what we are going to do, but this has to happen immediately. Disaster relief should be considered right now--no more excuses. I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today I want my colleagues to listen to some ideas that I have about tariffs, generally, and where we are on tariffs and where we might be on tariffs in a couple of weeks, depending on what the Secretary of Commerce says, because in a few days, that Secretary is expected to provide the President a report.  This report will detail his Department's findings in the investigation of whether imports of automobiles and auto parts pose a national threat to the United States. Common sense tells me it doesn't. Let me repeat that because I think it is important for us to understand whether the cars that everyday Americans rely on to get to work, to drive their children to schools, to visit their families--whether or not the importation of those automobiles threatens national security.  Now, having said that, you might think that I disagree with the President--and I don't--that we must have fair and enforceable trade agreements that benefit Americans. Sometimes we have to make hard decisions in order to get and have fair and enforceable agreements. I do not agree that we should alienate our allies or jeopardize the health of our economy to achieve the good outcomes of fair and enforceable agreements.  The Tax Foundation has found that a 25-percent tariff on auto imports would amount to roughly a $73.1 billion tax increase. According to the Center for Automotive Research, a 25-percent tariff on auto imports would also result in the loss of 700,000 jobs and raise the price of an average car by nearly $7,000.  Dealers would see a decline in annual sales by as many as 2 million vehicles. Consumers would face up to a 10-percent increase in the cost of repairs and replacement parts. In short, raising tariffs on cars and parts would be a huge tax on consumers who buy or service their cars, whether those cars are imported or domestically produced. Make no mistake, Americans will be paying those taxes.  Tariffs are a tax paid at the time of import. Historically, they have been a protectionist tool intended to prop up domestically produced goods by making foreign goods more expensive. Tariffs are not a long-term solution, and nobody wins with the producing of tariffs.  While they may provide short-term protection for domestic industries, they do so at the expense of ordinary consumers and industries increasingly dependent on a complex global supply chain. On the whole, I think this all adds up to damaging the economy. For an administration, including this Senator and most Republicans on this side of the aisle, who have been crowing about the benefits of the tax bill of late 2017 and the jobs it has created and the good it has done for workers, why would you want to put on a $73 billion tax increase through tariffs that would undo a lot of good that we say and the President says the tax bill has done. Let me repeat it again. On a whole, this is going to be damaging to the economy.  A 2018 study by the International Monetary Fund reviewed tariff changes across 151 countries between the decades of the 1960s to 2014. The International Monetary Fund found that tariff increases led to less output and less productivity, and, then, you know what happens. There is more unemployment, and when you have more unemployment, you get greater inequality.  The recent U.S. tariff increases have invited tariff retaliation from our trading partners. I know because Iowans are bearing the brunt of this retaliation. Imposing tariffs on auto parts will inevitably invite more retaliation, and we simply can't afford more of that.  The United States must continue to lead the world on trade and economic issues, as we have for at least the period of time since World War II. We have benefitted from one of the most open markets in the world, and we must continue to lead the world by providing a good example. We have led to a better world since World War II, and the results have been these. Several decades ago, 50 percent of the world's population was in poverty. Today, it is less than 10 percent. Recently, in two or three references I have seen, the fact is that right now or next year, as for major middle class status in the various countries around the world and in different ways around the world, half of the world is middle class. President Trump is right to hold our trading partners accountable. So I don't find fault with him there.  We can't take benefits we have received from international trade for granted. International trade has been a tremendous benefit to farmers and businesses in my State of Iowa and across the country. We are better off because we can sell our products around the world.  Our farmers say they don't want aid from the Federal Treasury. They want markets. They want to trade. You develop those markets and you keep those markets. Tariffs and retaliation send a signal to other countries that you might not be a reliable supplier, and they go elsewhere to create relationships that they can depend on. America ought to be able to be depended upon any place in the world from the standpoint of trade.  When you talk about America and Iowa exporting products, these are some of the best products in the world. In this vein, then, I hope the President will heed my call to forego the auto tariffs and instead focus on opening up new markets.  The U.S. auto industry is a major driver of our economy, supporting nearly 10 million American jobs and accounting for 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Without question, any tariffs that are imposed will have a negative effect on the U.S. auto industry and our economy.  Our focus, instead, should be on strengthening our relationships with our allies, while targeting China's harmful trade practices and policies. Tariffs on autos and auto parts will not help us achieve these critical priorities."

                "speech":"On another subject, I would like to, as I did yesterday, remind my colleagues about some of the benefits of tax policy. This is speaking about tax policy that I thought would be adopted as part of the upcoming appropriation bill to make sure we don't shut down government.  For several months now, we have been working to extend a set of tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017. Around here we commonly refer to these as ``tax extenders.'' We have also been working to enact bipartisan disaster tax relief to help families and businesses that continue to recover from the disasters that occurred across the country in 2018, and I thought that, too, would be in the bill we are going to vote on later today.  The best and most timely option to advance these provisions is with the government funding deal being worked on this week, but that isn't going to happen. There have been press reports stating that if the extenders aren't part of the funding bill, they are dead, and I reject that conclusion.  Regardless of what happens on the bill to keep the government open, I will continue to fight to get the extenders enacted and to work toward a longer term resolution. Since the House has failed to send us a government funding bill that includes the tax extenders and disaster tax relief provisions, look for me to introduce a bill addressing these tax matters here in the Senate, and I would ask my colleagues on the Finance Committee to join me in that effort.  When these provisions were extended early last year, the tax extenders had been expired for more than a year already. Now we are back in the very same place, with these tax incentives now expired for more than a year, again.  It seems to me that the right thing to do now is to extend these provisions for 2018 and 2019. Some people are saying you ought to do it longer. Why 2 years?  First, we need to provide clarity for taxpayers trying to file their 2018 returns, which are due in just over eight weeks. Even though the year has obviously ended, a repeated extension of many of these provisions has led individuals and businesses to assume that we will do so again. These business people relied on last year to make business decisions. In other words, people did what we wanted them to do when these provisions were created. We shouldn't retroactively punish them now for making those decisions that we wanted them to make.  Second, we should provide certainty for this year to give room to take a long-term view on all of the tax extenders. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term resolution of these provisions so that we can stop repeated extensions of temporary tax policy, but while we work on that, these extenders are intended to be incentives, and, to be successful, they need to be in effect when individuals and businesses are considering whether to make the investments required to take advantage of these particular tax extenders.  I want to go into more detail on what the tax extenders are. The numbers have changed over time, but there are now currently around 26 temporary tax provisions that expired at the end of 2017. At one time we were dealing with 50 to 55 such tax extenders, so we have reduced the number considerably. What we are dealing with now include provisions incentivizing alternative fuels, electric vehicles, and the construction of energy-efficient homes. These are provisions that incentivize the production of coal on Indian lands, provide an exclusion from income of the discharge of indebtedness on a principal residence, and provide a deduction for tuition and related expenses. Within these 26 provisions there is probably something that is very important to all 100 Senators, whether you are Republican or Democrat.  I want to focus on two of them in particular. The first is the railroad track maintenance credit, otherwise known as the short line credit. This provision provides short line railroads a credit equal to a percentage of the capital they invest to maintain and improve their tracks.  Short line railroads are small business railroads that are vital to keeping rural and small town America connected to the national economy. They are a particularly important part of our transportation system for getting agricultural and other products to market across the country and, hopefully, abroad.  For example, the Iowa Interstate Railroad, which operates between Council Bluffs and Chicago, connects Iowa companies such as the Elite Octane ethanol plant in Atlantic, IA, to the world market.  According to the American Short Line and Regional Rail Association, short line railroads operate more than 47,500 miles of track and make up 29 percent of the freight rail network of our Nation.  In a report prepared by PWC last year, it was noted that the short line industry directly provided more than 17,000 jobs in the United States in 2016 and supported more than 61,000 jobs overall. This credit has been extended many times since it was first enacted on a temporary basis in 2004. Legislation introduced in the last Congress would have made the short line credit permanent, and the bill had 56 cosponsors in the Senate. The bill is led by Senators Crapo and Wyden and has already been reintroduced for this Congress.  Another tax extender that is very important, particularly for Iowa, is the biodiesel tax credit. Generally, this provision provides a tax credit of $1 per gallon for biodiesel and renewable diesel. This credit helps provide for a more sustainable future by reducing our dependency on fossil fuels and promoting a renewable domestic resource.  Plans for promoting environmental efficiency have been in the news lately, and an extension of the biodiesel tax credit is needed to keep more people working at their jobs in this industry. For example, I have learned that Western Iowa Energy in Wall Lake, IA, has reduced runtime forecasts by 60 percent, consequently running at 40 percent capacity. They are also putting capital improvement projects on hold.  In Wall Lake, this reduction in runtimes means that there are 26 trucks per day that are not operating, and potential layoffs are on the horizon if the tax credit is not extended as soon as possible.  According to the National Biodiesel Board, the U.S. biodiesel industry supports more than 60,000 jobs and generates more than 11 billion in economic impact.  A group of renewable energy stakeholders wrote to congressional leaders last week. Their letter reads in part: ``Allowing these tax incentives to lapse has created uncertainty for investors and the industry--``jeopardizing the long-term investments necessary for the development of these biofuels.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters to Congress regarding tax extenders from biofuel and biodiesel businesses and associations across the United States.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as someone who has been here for some period of time, I was glad to see Republicans and Democrats, both in the House and the Senate, come together in the past few weeks, especially this week.  We ignored the distractions and tweetstorms coming from the White House. We reached an agreement to fund our government and make responsible investments for the American people.  Not one of us--none of the final four who did the negotiations, sitting in that room, felt that this was an agreement that any one of us would have individually written.  There are things in this bill that I support and things I disagree with, but that could be said by all four of us, Republicans and Democrats. You try to find as much common ground as you can. Everybody had to give something, but we ended up with a bipartisan compromise. We had to deal with facts that are based on reality, not rhetoric based on political fantasy.  Democrats have always supported border security, but we support smart border security, targeted strategies that address the real problems facing us at our southwest border. That is what we tried to accomplish here. We stood together. We rejected the toxic and hate-filled immigration tweets coming from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.  The agreement does not fund President Trump's wasteful wall. After all, he gave his solemn promise to the American public that Mexico would pay for it, so let them work on that. It does not fund President Trump's requested deportation force, and it rejects the unjustified and dramatic increase in the detention bed levels the President would have used to enforce his extreme immigration policy.  But just as important as what this agreement rejects is what we were able to accomplish.  We invested hundreds of millions of dollars in new technology to stop the flow of illegal drugs through our ports of entry. All Republicans and all Democrats supported that. We provide funds to hire more judges to address the immigration backlog in our country. We provide more than half a billion dollars to support Central American countries, addressing the root causes of undocumented migration. We included $400 million to improve medical care and address the humanitarian concerns at the border. Every one of us has seen enough of what is going on there; we are trying to show that America--the greatest Nation on Earth, also the wealthiest and the most humanitarian--will address it.  This is what a compromise looks like. This is how the American people expect our government to function--not by tweets but by reasonable, reality-based compromise.  Unfortunately, often lost in this debate over border security were the more than 800,000 public servants and their families who were held hostage by the Trump shutdown for weeks. They once again lived in fear and uncertainty that their next paycheck may not come because the President chose to use them as hostages. This agreement ensures that these public servants remain on the job doing the important work of the American people through the end of the fiscal year, and also all those who are not on a government payroll but support all our different Agencies that were involved in this. They weren't paid either.  This agreement funds nine Federal Departments. Keep in mind--it is not just the borders; it is nine Federal Departments and their related Agencies. I will give a couple of examples. It increases funding for the Environmental Protection Agency. It supports our national parks. It rejects the anti-science know-nothingism of the administration by supporting research and our dedicated scientists.  This is extremely important to me because Senator Crapo and I wrote the last Violence Against Women authorization. We wrote the expansion of that law. Our bill today provides the highest funding level ever for the Office on Violence Against Women to support programs that prevent domestic violence. It also provides more than half a billion dollars to combat the opioid crisis. In my earlier career, I saw too many deaths because of the violence against women. I saw too many deaths of young people from drug overdoses, and the numbers have only dramatically increased from the days when I was a prosecutor. Supporting the Violence Against Women Act brought Republicans and Democrats together.  The agreement invests in rural America, secures our interests abroad, rebuilds our highways, and supports public housing.  This week, four of us met--first in Chairman Shelby's Appropriations Committee office and then later into the evening several times in my office here in the Capitol. Senator Shelby, Representative Lowey, Representative Granger, and I proved that we can set aside the political struggles in Washington to find a path to progress for the American people--two Republicans and two Democrats who are four of the most senior Members of the House and the Senate. I thank them for their effort.  If I can go to a personal matter for just a moment, I want to thank Senator Shelby for his friendship and his partnership. Senator Shelby and I come from different parts of the country. We are much different politically, but he is one of the closest friends I have here. He and his wonderful wife, Dr. Annette Shelby, my wife Marcelle, and I have traveled to so many places together. Some were very grim areas of this world. But we understand how grownups have to act in the Congress and how they have to work together. We worked together with our House counterparts--the senior Democrat and senior Republican in the House--on this conference. We worked together. We didn't pass just Homeland Security; we passed all 12 appropriations bills on a bipartisan basis. I hope we do the same thing for fiscal year 2020. I hope that we can begin very soon, with Senator Shelby and me working together, to pass the fiscal year 2020 bills. We passed the ones last year out of our committee virtually unanimously. We were able to get Members of both parties to join us. I thank him.  I also thank the Appropriations Committee staff on both sides of the aisle for their hard work. I joke that Senators are merely constitutional impediments to their staff. Evening after evening, sometimes into the wee hours of the morning, weekend after weekend, I saw dedicated men and women in the Appropriations Committee staff working line by line to try to get us through this.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of their names be printed in the Record. I conclude by saying it takes a lot of long days and it takes a lot of long nights to produce a bill of this magnitude. I appreciate their hard work.  I think we may have others who will want to speak.  Mr. President, how much time do we have before the vote?"

The agreement was a product of a lot of hard work and long nights and weekends by members of the conference committee and their staffs. I want to salute Senator Leahy and Senator Shelby. I want to salute all of the conferees.  When Leader McConnell and I met--as we moved to open up the government for a short period of time--I suggested that we do a conference committee because I had a great deal of faith in the members of the conference committees on both sides of the aisle, and that faith has proved to be vindicated. I thank Senator Leahy, Senator Shelby, their staffs, and all the members of the conference committee for the great job they have done.

It will provide desperately needed humanitarian assistance--medical support, transportation, food, and clothing--for children and families in detention. It will provide funding to our neighbors in Central America to fight the actual root causes of migration--the violent gangs and drug cartels.  In short, it represents a fair compromise that includes priorities from both sides of the aisle. I expect the legislation will pass this Chamber with a significant bipartisan majority, pass the House, and be sent to the President with plenty of time to avoid a government shutdown tomorrow at midnight.  There is word that the President will declare a national emergency. I hope he won't. That would be a very wrong thing to do. Leader Pelosi and I will be responding to that in short order, but before that, I just want to say that in order to reach this point, in order to attain this bipartisan compromise, 800,000 public servants were forced to suffer without pay for over a month as President Trump put the country through a completely unnecessary shutdown that snarled airports, delayed loans for farmers and small businesses, trashed our national parks, and took billions of dollars out of our economy.  We still need to address the plight of government contractors who still have not been made whole. Regrettably, we were unable to include that in the agreement, but we are going to keep working and fighting for Senator Smith's proposal to ensure our contractors are made whole again.  The Senate was in the very same position just before Christmas, with a deal in hand, when the President reversed himself and engineered the longest shutdown in American history. After all of the pain of the shutdown caused by President Trump, we are basically right back where we started, with nearly the same parameters of a bipartisan agreement we were ready to pass around Christmas. Leader Pelosi and I, for instance, offered the President $1.37 billion for border security with the same language that would have prohibited the wall then as is in the agreement now.  Let this be a lesson. Government shutdowns don't work. I hope President Trump has learned that lesson once and for all. I hope we never go down the road to shutdowns again. The American people suffer and very little is accomplished.  President Trump should sign this bill ASAP.  I yield the floor."

First of all, I thank Senator Leahy, the vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who worked diligently for the past year to get to where we are today in a bipartisan way and also, recently, in the conference committee, which we thought last week had broken down. I also thank Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader. I thank everybody else who has contributed to get us to this point.  Nothing is perfect, but we think this is a good bill for the American people. It opens up all of the government--the 25 percent that we had not addressed.  The conference report includes a robust and comprehensive investment in border security, providing funding for personnel, technology, and infrastructure that is critical to keeping our nation secure and our people safe. Critically, the bill provides nearly $1,400,000,000 to further construction of a barrier along the southwest border. But that is only a down payment. More resources are required. Fortunately, the President has at his disposal both constitutional and existing statutory authorities that allow him to supplement the congressional investment in border security that was made today. This bill preserves those authorities, and I support action by the President to use them to the fullest extent permissible to secure our border. In particular, this bill does not restrict the President's ability to declare a national emergency or to exercise emergency authorities under such a declaration. Nor does this bill further restrict the Administration's ability, previously granted by the Congress, to transfer funds in support of efforts to gain operational control of our southwest border and to cease the trafficking of persons and drugs across it.  I am going to get on with the vote.  I want to say thank you to everybody, including Shannon Hines on our staff and everybody else who contributed to this.  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to waive the mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture vote on the conference report to accompany H.J. Res. 31."

It is good news that we passed it by a lot of votes, and I hope the House does it by a lot, too.  I need to comment on the news that President Trump may declare a national emergency in an attempt to build his border wall. If President Trump decides to go forward with a disaster declaration, he will be making a tremendous mistake.  Declaring a national emergency would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the Presidency, and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for the wall. It will be another demonstration of President Trump's naked contempt for the rule of law and congressional authority.  Congress just debated this very issue. There was not support for the President's position. Congressional intent on this issue is very clear. The President's wall has been before Congress several times and has never garnered enough votes to even merit consideration. For the President to declare an emergency now would be an unprecedented subversion of Congress's constitutional prerogative.  The fact is, this is not an emergency, and the President's fearmongering doesn't make it one. A policy dispute about our southern border does not constitute a national emergency. Democrats support and have always supported strong border security, but the fact is, according to the CBP, apprehensions at our southern border are at historic lows.  President Trump couldn't convince Mexico, he couldn't convince the American people, and he couldn't convince their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall. Now he is trying an end run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it. Make no mistake--Congress will defend our constitutional authorities in every way that we can.

                "speech":" Mr. President, over the last 2 years, many of us have grappled with a very difficult question about our President. It is a question that never before could we even imagine thinking about an American President, let alone saying it out loud on the floor of the Senate. I am talking about the entirely legitimate question of whether Donald Trump could be compromised by the Russian Government. It is more than a legitimate question; it is the natural question that comes to mind every time we learn more about the links between President Trump, his associates, and the Russian Government.  With the Mueller investigation possibly coming to a close in the near future, we may be forced to deal with--both Congress and the American public--some very stark facts about the President's ties to Russia. Just think about the reported revelations over the last month or so.  We have learned that President Trump took unprecedented steps to conceal the contents of his conversations with Putin from his own advisers.  We have learned that following one of the meetings with Putin, Trump phoned a New York Times reporter to argue that Russia did not interfere in the 2016 election--once again carrying the Kremlin's water in direct conflict with the entire U.S. intelligence community.  We have learned that over the past year, President Trump repeatedly argued for pulling the United States out of NATO--something that Putin desires.  We continue to learn new details about Paul Manafort's--President Trump's campaign chairman--meetings with Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian national with suspected ties to Russian intelligence and an associate of Oleg Deripaska's. We know that Manafort met with Kilimnik repeatedly, provided him with polling data, and discussed ending U.S. sanctions and adopting a Russia-friendly peace plan for Ukraine. This is perhaps the most significant indication that Trump's inner circle was discussing pro-Kremlin policies in the months before the election.  Tellingly, just last night, we learned that Manafort has lied again and again about the truth of his contacts and his conversations. Did Manafort determine that lying to prosecutors was a better alternative to telling the truth?  Finally, let's not forget the revelation from just a few weeks ago that the Nation's top law enforcement agency reportedly opened a counterintelligence investigation into the President, in part for firing the FBI Director because of ``this Russia thing.''  You can't make this stuff up. Not even in your wildest dreams, not even on the TV set of ``Homeland'' could you make this stuff up. The news of a possible counterintelligence investigation against a sitting President should shake us all to the core. Instead, we are barely even surprised.  For the rightwing pundits who spoon-feed a warped reality to President Trump every hour of the day, it is just one more excuse to paint him--the most powerful man in the world--as a victim, but for the rest of us, these revelations only sharpen the dread that gnaws at us as we search our minds for any explanation for President Trump's perplexing posture toward Russia.  Look, I may have my differences with the President on tax policy, on immigration policy, on healthcare policy, and more, but let me assure you, every time he was set to meet with Putin, I, for one, hoped and prayed that our President would prove our suspicions wrong.  I hoped that the President of the United States would stand up to Putin and demand accountability for Russia's interference in the 2016 elections--the cyber attacks, the stolen data, the malign social influence campaigns designed to stoke division and doubt in the American people. I hoped President Trump would make clear to Putin that legal aggression against Ukraine and the continual denial of Ukrainian sovereignty is unacceptable and will result in consequences. I hoped President Trump would not congratulate Putin on another sham election victory but operate from a position of truth about his grip on power--that it comes from the oppression of the Russian people, the seizure of their assets, the torture and murder of dissenters, the building of a chemical weapons arsenal, and the denial of a free press and basic human rights. And of course I hoped President Trump would not budge an inch on sanctions on the Kremlin.  But time and again, our President has let us down. He has let our country down. He has left Americans to lie awake at night asking themselves: What does Putin have on our President? Why won't he hold Russia accountable? Why won't he champion the values of democracy, freedom, and human rights that transcend political parties and define our greatest ideals as a nation?  Instead, our President champions talking points that could have only come out of the Kremlin. Let me provide just a few examples.  He told the leaders of the G7 that Crimea should be a part of Russia. He told the President of France to leave the EU. He said that Montenegro, a NATO member, could start World War III because they are ``very aggressive people.'' He said that the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan because ``terrorists were going into Russia'' and Russia was ``right to be there.''  The Wall Street Journal rightly said that ``we cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President.''  I challenge anyone to find one person--one person in the State Department, the Defense Department, the National Security Council--who believes these statements and would have put them in the President's ear. So who does he get these ideas from? I can think of only one person--his good friend Vladimir Putin.  Thus far, our greatest insights into what may be driving President Trump's peculiar behavior toward Russia have come out of Special Counsel Mueller's investigation and the additional investigations spawned by it. With every new court filing, we learn that the tentacles of Russian influence over the President and his associates are wrapped tighter than we previously thought.  Meanwhile, the President and his cheerleaders on FOX News continue to discredit the Mueller probe as some kind of partisan witch hunt, when the truth is that it has already resulted in 4 individual sentences, 7 guilty pleas, and a total of more than 30 people and 3 Russian entities charged.  But all of this still begs the question why. Why does President Trump behave as though he has been compromised by the Russian Government? Why is he so deferential to Putin? We saw that at the Helsinki summit. Why have those around the President gone to such great lengths to cover up and lie about the extent of their interactions with Russia and with Russians?  Of course, if we can consider the possibility that the President is an asset of the Russian Government, we then have to wonder whether he is a witting or an unwitting asset.  On the one hand, it seems as though most of what President Trump does is unwitting. Perhaps his refusal to take Russian interference in 2016 seriously is merely an outgrowth of his narcissism, a symptom of a fragile ego that cannot accept that maybe, just maybe the unprecedented malign influence campaign orchestrated by the Kremlin did indeed sway some votes on election day.  On the other hand, the more I learn about President Trump's strange behavior toward Russia, the more I wonder if he knows exactly what is going on; the more I wonder if he knows that his campaign was making promises about pro-Kremlin positions and rolling back sanctions; the more I wonder if Trump knows that he is indebted to Russia and cannot allow the truth of his business dealings to come to light, for the truth may tell us that Trump's overtures to Putin, his disparaging of NATO, his refusal to fully apply congressionally mandated sanctions, and his mixed messages on Ukraine are actually instances of conspiracy with the Kremlin in real time.  Perhaps it is because I am from New Jersey and I have lived through decades of Donald Trump's questionable business dealings, but I cannot understand why anyone would flat out reject the proposition that he is indebted to Russia. He is the first Presidential candidate in decades to refuse to disclose his tax returns. He is the first President in modern history to refuse to divest from his business interests, leaving us wondering whether he and his family are profiting from his position in the Oval Office.  Beyond the myth of the man, Trump is no business genius. He was a millionaire by age 8, thanks to his father. He ran the business into the ground. He defaulted on debt, refused to pay workers, and declared multiple corporate bankruptcies. Eventually, American banks saw through him and refused to lend him money, so Trump had to look elsewhere for cash. When you have been essentially blacklisted from the U.S. banking system, where do you turn? You turn to less savory sources.  The fact that the Trump Organization courted and sold real estate to wealthy Russian buyers and financiers is no secret, nor is the reality that to be wealthy in Putin's Russia means to have close ties to the Kremlin. Much of the stolen wealth amassed by Putin and his cronies must be hidden from the global financial system, so where do you turn? Real estate.  After a string of bankruptcies and racking up debt for years, the Trump Organization suddenly began making a spate of large, unexplainable cash purchases, totaling $400 million over 9 years. Giant, mysterious, inexplicable cash transactions are the hallmark of money laundering. So where did they get the cash? Well, if we are to believe the words of the President and his sons, much of it came from Russia. In fact, it was Donald Junior who said in 2008 that ``we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia'' and Eric Trump who reportedly said in 2014 that ``we don't rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.''  We know that several Trump projects, like Trump SoHo and Trump Toronto, received significant funding from Kremlin-linked financiers. In fact, Trump Toronto was funded by an asset sale by the Russian bank VTB--a transaction that would have likely needed approval from Putin himself. We now know that the Trump Organization pursued the Trump Moscow project for far longer than he led on, including well into his campaign for President.  The President has unequivocally said that he has ``zero investments in Russia.'' Well, here is the problem: Donald Trump may not have investments in Russia, but it is quite possible that the Kremlin has an investment in him.  That is what keeps me up at night.  That is why I believe the time is now to pass legislation requiring all Presidential candidates to disclose their tax returns and why I am the sponsor of such legislation.  So many of my colleagues decried Trump's shattering of this norm, but since he arrived at White House, the Republicans have done nothing to stop it from becoming the new normal.  We still don't know who is behind the vast majority of the Trump organization projects around the world, many of which continue to this day. We have to follow the money to get to the truth. How else will we ever know why our President is either unable or unwilling to publicly stand up to Putin?  What too many of my Republican colleagues seem to forget is that at the end of the day, this is not about Donald Trump; it is about the American people. It is about whether an American President may be beholden to foreign interests and how those interests fare against our own.  When the President embraces our greatest adversaries and gives the back of the hand to our closest allies; when he continually denies Russia's interference in 2016 and belittles the findings of our entire intelligence community; when, in spite of those findings, he suggests lifting sanctions on the Russians; when he backs down from challenging Putin after Russia commits an unacceptable act of aggression against Ukraine in the Sea of Azov, an international border, then we need a Congress willing to live up to its role as a coequal branch of government.  We cannot blindly follow a potentially compromised President down this dangerous path in which our alliances are suffering, our leadership on the global stage is waning, and our competitors are seeking to fill the void.  We need to know the facts--not the latest spin dropped by Rudy Giuliani--the facts. The American people deserve to know whom they elected to be their President. They deserve to know if he is, in fact, putting America's interests first. They deserve to know if Donald Trump is wittingly or unwittingly an agent for the Russian Federation.  Congress must carry out its constitutional duty to fully and thoroughly investigate where the facts lead. That is why we must protect the integrity of all oversight efforts including the objective, sober investigation still being conducted by Robert Mueller, and that is why we must push for his final report to be made public to the American people.  At the same time, this administration's deference to the Kremlin demands Congress be proactive in shaping U.S. foreign policy toward Russia, especially with respect to sanctions. We saw that with the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions or CAATSA law passed in 2017 with the support of 98 Senators.  Given the circumstances we face today, we need additional legislation to protect American interests. That is why Senator Graham and I introduced just yesterday the Defending America's Security from Kremlin Aggression Act or DASKA, a bipartisan piece of legislation that is joined by several of our Republican colleagues.  This comprehensive legislation will ensure our diplomats have the tools to advance our interests and stand up to the bully in the Kremlin. It includes new sanctions, as well as provisions designed to harden our democratic institutions and make us less vulnerable to attack. Perhaps most urgently, DASKA requires Senate consent, should the President act on his desire to pull the United States out of NATO. To risk letting this President pull our Nation out of a military alliance so vital to America's security would be a tragedy fit for the ages.  The collapse of NATO is No. 1 on Mr. Putin's wish list, and with leaders like Secretary Mattis no longer around to babysit this President, Congress has a responsibility to act. This bipartisan bill is essential to giving the United States a more solid footing against the Kremlin moving forward.  We should treat DASKA with urgency. The time to pass this legislation is now. We need hearings, a vote on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and swift consideration on the floor of the Senate.  Likewise, we must finally pass legislation to protect the Mueller investigation and to require that all Presidential candidates release their tax returns.  I know, deep down, that many of my Republican colleagues share my concerns. I have talked with them, a fair number of them, yet they are afraid of angering the Party of Trump. Well, I believe that they would be seen as American heroes.  Should the facts confirm our greatest fears to be true, I ask my colleagues to consider what the history books will say about those who knew the President of the United States might very well be compromised by a foreign power, yet still did nothing. I am talking about my Republican colleagues who seem to have numbed themselves to the latest bombshell revelations about the President's posture on Russia. Apparently, they don't want to know why Russia interfered in 2016 to help Trump win. They don't want to know why the Republican platform's strong language on Russia was watered down by the Trump team. They don't want to know how someone deeply indebted to Russian oligarchs and later caught giving polling data to Russian intelligence contacts became chairman of the campaign. They don't want to know why Russia began hacking Hillary Clinton's emails the same day that Candidate Trump asked them to do so. They don't want to know why the President undermines our intelligence community and attacks law enforcement for investigating Russian interference. They don't want to know why he seeks to dismantle NATO, a pillar of security, prosperity, and the defense of western democratic ideals. They don't want to know why he shares Putin's joy when discord unfolds in Europe. They don't want to know why Trump forbade his interpreter from disclosing the contents of his conversations with Putin and took his notes. In short, they don't want to know the truth.  Well, now is not the time to ignore the facts or avoid the truth. We are living in a time of unthinkable questions, and should the facts reveal the most unthinkable of answers, we must do what is necessary to protect the interests of the United States of America.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":" Mr. President, first, let me commend the Senator from New Jersey for his very articulate, detailed, and factually specific discussion of Russian malign influence across the globe but, particularly, here in the United States.                         Russian Hybrid Warfare  Mr. President, today I rise to continue my series of speeches with regard to Russian hybrid warfare and, specifically, to provide policy recommendations in response to the threat from Russia, particularly the threat from information warfare, which was exhibited so substantially in the 2016 election.  The first part of the speech I gave on January 24 of this year, but let me briefly recap. As I described in my previous speech, Russia is prosecuting an ongoing, persistent campaign of information warfare targeted at the United States and Western democracies. These information operations are conducted along specific lines of effort and employ tactics, techniques, and procedures that Russia has developed over years of experimentation. Russia has been particularly effective in adapting its information warfare playbook to the digital age, weaponizing social media to magnify fear and mistrust, create chaos, and undermine our ability to respond effectively.  There are four steps we must adopt to more effectively counter Russian information warfare. First, we need the President to fulfill the obligations of his office and unite the American people in confronting this national security threat. Second, we need a coordinated strategy across our government and society to counter those threats. Third, and flowing from the coordinated strategy, we need to ensure our government and society are organized and have the right capabilities to manage this ongoing confrontation in the information space. Finally, we need to develop, in coordination with our allies and partners, our own playbook to fight back.  Let me address each of these proposals in turn.  First of all, we need the President to be straight with the American people. The President's own national security officials and intelligence community agree about the existence and seriousness of the attacks being conducted by Russia against our democracy. The President, as our Nation's leader, must embrace the same conclusion. By conveying to the American people the urgency of this national security threat, the President can ensure that as a nation we are responding with the same level of commitment as we would to a military threat. This will elevate the urgency and gravity of the matter and help ensure we are committing the necessary level of resources for both military and nonmilitary measures to counter the Russian threat and build resilience against these malign activities.  Presidential leadership is necessary to help us move past domestic parochial politics. We have already seen how the failure to put national security over partisan politics all but decimated our ability to counter Russian information warfare during the 2016 election. The German Marshall Fund concluded in their policy blueprint from last year that ``removing partisanship from the calculus in responding to this threat is critical.'' This is not a Democratic or a Republican problem. This is a national security problem, and it is severe. If we are going to overcome Russian efforts to magnify fear and distrust, we need our President to put our national security first.  Presidential leadership is just as imperative beyond our borders. The President speaks to the American people. His words must send a clear and consistent message to the Kremlin that we will not tolerate attacks against the United States. A real opportunity was missed when the President did not use his platform during the State of the Union to denounce Russian attacks on our democracy and showcase to the world the depth of his commitment in countering this threat.  The world must understand that the President is serious and committed to protecting the United States, its allies, and its partners against information warfare and will do so for as long as required. As a recent report by the Treasury Department on efforts by the United States to combat illicit finance noted: ``Russia must . . . realize that the United States and its allies will not waver in our determination to prevent it from undermining our democracies, economies, institutions, and the values on which these pillars of global stability--ensured by United States leadership--will continue to stand.''  The President should heed his own administration's guidance. He should do so publicly and with the resolve expected of the Commander in Chief.  Unfortunately, the President's history on this subject to date is far from encouraging. His policy positions do not follow dictums outlined by the Treasury Department and others in his administration but, instead, mirror Russian strategic objectives. His foreign policy goals and those of Russia seem to overlap. The President's devastating threats to withdraw from NATO and his denigration of the European Union, our trading partners, and those he considers his domestic political adversaries create or exacerbate internal divisions. The President must be made to realize that Russia supports his approach to foreign relations and domestic politics.  The President is, of course, by no means alone in demonizing those with whom he disagrees, but his voice is far more powerful as a result of the office he holds, and it is his obligation and duty to lead. Not only must the President distinguish his policy positions from those that Russia promotes overtly and through disinformation campaigns to tear up the fabric of the West, he must wholeheartedly reject those tactics and defend our Nation against them.  The President needs to get on the same page with much of the rest of the U.S. Government and Congress. The heads of the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence all came together to send a tough message to Russia ahead of the 2018 midterm elections. Congress has been united, as well, as evidenced by the overwhelmingly bipartisan passage of the Russia sanctions bill as part of the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act or CAATSA.  Yet this tough messaging to Russia is completely undermined when the President fails to confront Putin over Russian malign activities and, instead, repeatedly downplays the significance of Russian interference with our democracy and society.  It is further undermined when he mirrors Putin's talking points and dismisses the Russian nationals indicted by the special counsel, including 12 Russian military intelligence or GRU agents, as merely ``bloggers from Moscow.'' It is further undermined when the administration unwinds sanctions against a business of Putin crony Oleg Deripaska. I would note that this deal went forward in spite of bipartisan action in the Congress to try to block it. The President's mixed messages and failure of leadership in mounting sustained and credible deterrence must end.  Despite the lack of Presidential leadership, there is work underway to counter Russian hybrid warfare--and specifically information warfare--at the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Treasury, Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as the National Security Agency, Cyber Command, and broader elements of the Department of Defense.  These efforts include standing up task forces between DHS and the FBI to target foreign influence within our borders, reorganizing the internal structures of DHS, and establishing the Russia Influence Group across several national security agencies. NSA and Cyber Command also established a working group called the Russia Small Group to counter Kremlin information warfare campaigns.  We must recognize the results these efforts have yielded to date. As authorized by this year's National Defense Authorization Act, or the NDAA, Cyber Command has undertaken offensive cyber operations. Treasury has sanctioned more than 270 Russian individuals and related entities. The Department of Justice has used our legal system to expose GRU and the Kremlin-linked troll organization activities.  These efforts signify that our capable civil servants and military officials have developed ways to mitigate aspects of the threat against us, but what is lacking is a synchronized campaign, prosecuted in a unified manner, to counter Russian hybrid warfare against the United States, our allies, and our partners.  General Scaparrotti, the head of European Command--who is on the frontlines of this threat--testified to the Armed Services Committee last March: ``[I] don't believe there is effective unification across the interagency, with the energy and the focus that we could attain.''  The Trump administration's national defense strategy emphasizes the ``reemergence of long-term strategic competition,'' including with Russia. I agree that this is an appropriate place to focus attention, but I have yet to see the changes needed to align with those priorities.  We must develop wholesale, scalable strategy to counter these threats below the level of armed conflict, including on the 21st-century battlefields of information and cyber space. It must be noted that Congress, including in the NDAA, has repeatedly urged the administration in this direction.  Two years ago, I secured a provision, along with my colleagues, to require the Department of Defense, in conjunction with the Department of State and other Agencies, to craft a Russian malign influence strategy. That strategy was finally delivered a few months ago, and it highlights the various efforts U.S. Government Departments and Agencies are undertaking. However, as I have said before, the administration must build on and implement that strategy, and these efforts must be conducted in a unified manner at the direction of the President both operationally and also as the chief spokesperson to the Nation and to the world.  This year's NDAA authorized the appointment of a foreign influence coordinator on the National Security Council staff. This would be a good step toward organizing a whole-of-government approach to counter Russian information warfare. However, it remains to be seen whether the administration will stand up such a position.  Once we have laid out a comprehensive strategy, we must ensure that it can be successfully executed. This will require the support of the right organizational structures across the government and the whole of society.  The National Defense Strategy Commission concluded in its report that Russia ``developed national strategies for enhancing their influence and undermining key U.S. interests that extend far beyond military competition . . . [C]omprehensive solutions to these comprehensive challenges will require whole-of-government and even whole-of-nation cooperation extending far beyond DOD.  As the Commission notes, we need to be institutionally capable of anticipating Russian information warfare developments. As a nation, we have been too slow, too late, and too divided in acknowledging the severity of these attacks on our governmental institutions and society. We watched Kremlin-directed information attacks in the Ukraine, the United Kingdom, and elsewhere, but we didn't conceive that this Russian playbook would be deployed against us.  What is more, we are starting from a deficit in terms of the way our government is organized. After the Cold War, we dismantled the apparatus in place to recognize and counter threats from the Soviet Union. More recently, we found ourselves embroiled in two long counterinsurgency wars, which reoriented our planning, our systems, and our weapons to counter those threats of insurgents in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere. We took our eye off the growing challenges to the international order in Europe, and frankly we were late to realize that the Russians had either pushed past any reset in U.S.-Russia relations or had never actually stopped seeing us as their enemy. So we need to rebuild our capacity to challenge this threat.  First, we must ensure that we have the intelligence capabilities in place to yield a more complete understanding of the nature of the threat. One of the reasons that the Kremlin caught us off guard is because we significantly downsized the office in the CIA unofficially called Russia House, which was tasked with countering Russia during the Cold War.  While the number of Russian analysts has grown in recent years, we must make sure that we grow and retain the expertise and the budget dedicated to analyzing, attributing, anticipating, and exposing Russian information warfare campaigns on a persistent basis.  As I quoted in part 1 of this speech, the senior vice president of the Center for European Policy Analysis, Edward Lucas, explained that we ``are still playing catch up from a long way behind. We are looking in the rearview mirror, getting less bad at working out what Russia just did to us. We are still not looking through the windshield to find out what's happening now and what's going to be happening next.''  If we are ever going to get out from looking at this problem through the rearview mirror, we need to understand the patterns of Russia's aggressive behavior and be able to anticipate the next attack.  In addition to ramping up Russia expertise, there needs to be a coordinating body across the national security apparatus to provide intelligence and analysis sharing. This body would work to provide a common operating picture for our government and help with strategic coordination across U.S. Government Agencies involved in countering hybrid warfare.  A proposal to stand up an interagency fusion cell similar to what I am describing was recommended in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee minority staff report from January 2018. That report envisioned that such a center ``should include representatives from the FBI, CIA, the Departments of Homeland Security, State, Defense, and Treasury, and it should immediately produce a strategy, plan, and robust budget that coordinates all current and projected government programming to counter Russian Government interference and malign influence.''  Similarly, the Defending American Security from Kremlin Aggression Act, or DASKA, a bill that Senator Menendez indicated was reintroduced yesterday in a bipartisan fashion--Senator Menendez and Senator Graham are leading this effort--includes language to establish such a fusion center. I urge my colleagues to support this type of a center. It will go a long way toward further integrating a whole-of-government approach.  In conjunction with standing up such a center, Congress may need to examine the authorities of some intelligence agencies, as it becomes harder to detect and counter Russian operations that look increasingly ``American'' in nature.  Our military institutions also need to be structured to counter Russian information operations--in particular those conducted by the GRU. As laid out in part 1 of this speech, these operations are persistent and ongoing, reflecting current Russian military doctrine, and follow discernable lines of effort. We must bring appropriate military tools to counter this threat.  Last November, General Nakasone, who serves as both the head of Cyber Command and the Director of the NSA, explained that America's adversaries, including Russia, ``are looking to take us on below the level of armed conflict. Our military must be able to . . . compete below the level of armed conflict. This is what great power competition looks like today, and it's what we will look at as we look to the future.''  Indeed, this type of conflict requires new tools in cyber space, including offensive cyber operations and updated protocols for using them.  It should be noted that Cyber Command took important steps to safeguard the 2018 midterm elections. Several days prior to the election, National Security Advisor Ambassador John Bolton acknowledged this role, stating that the United States was ``undertaking offensive cyber operations . . . aimed at defending the integrity of the electoral process.'' Similarly, the Department of Defense explained that it worked to ``frustrate and prevent adversary interference in the 2018 election cycle.'' It appears that these cyber operations contributed to more successful deterrence or a blunting of the Russian information warfare campaign than during the 2016 Presidential election.  That said, we also must acknowledge that the Russians have not stopped their operations against us, and they don't undertake information warfare campaigns only at election time. As we learn to counter their operations, they learn better methods to attack us, often with increased sophistication and less detectability. In order to stay up to speed, we must institutionalize the temporary arrangements that the Department of Defense assembled for addressing information warfare operations in the midterm elections and make them permanent. Our efforts must be persistent and scalable to ensure we have the operational capacity to respond to these attacks against our democracy.  Along those same lines, in last year's NDAA, we required the Secretary of Defense to establish a process to integrate strategic and cyber-enabled information operations across the Department. While information operations were a feature of military operations during the Cold War, today they are sometimes an afterthought. Having better integrated procedures for these types of operations would be a good start for getting organized inside DOD to effectively counter Russian information warfare below the level of conventional conflict.  Just as important as ensuring that we have the right military and intelligence tools, is ensuring that we have the appropriate nonmilitary tools to counter the threat. An additional castoff after the Cold War was the U.S. Information Agency, which was devoted to advancing public diplomacy, building narratives, and extolling American virtues to foreign audiences. We should consider carefully whether it makes sense to revive some of these capabilities for today's information age.  One important step toward reestablishing such a capability was enlarging the mission of the State Department's Global Engagement Center in the fiscal year 2017 NDAA to ``lead, synchronize, and coordinate efforts of the Federal Government to recognize, understand, expose, and counter'' foreign state propaganda and disinformation targeting U.S. national security interests. However, the Global Engagement Center has been under resourced and slow to execute its mission. We need to accelerate this effort.  We also need to look at our tools and tactics for informing our domestic audience, including how best to address concerns about the integrity of elections arising as a result of Russian meddling.  As a recent report from CSIS on election security stressed, ``Credibility is as important as accuracy.'' We should examine what approach would best serve the American people in terms of validating the integrity of election results, as well as mobilizing to respond should our elections come under attack.  This effort could be centered around a dedicated office or assigned to a group of current or former trusted government officials. Their mission would be to rapidly communicate to the American public regarding the integrity of elections in response to Russian efforts to undermine the public faith in democracy, including through information warfare attacks.  The administration has taken steps in this direction, including the President's Executive order regarding election interference from last September, which requires a 45-day report assessing attacks from foreign adversaries. But this won't be fast enough to counter information warfare campaigns in real time. These attacks are moving at the speed of the internet. We don't have 45 days to wait.  As we look to the 2020 Presidential elections, it is imperative that we invest more in election security. While progress has been made since 2016, it has paled in comparison to the magnitude of the challenge.  Last Congress, I was disappointed when an amendment to provide an additional $250 million in election security grant funding was blocked by my colleagues on the other side. This funding would have built upon the $380 million that was appropriated for election security grants in the fiscal year 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act. At the time of the vote last summer, the initial funding was already committed to the States, and 91 percent of those funds had been disbursed. We will need to provide the funding necessary if we are to claim that we are committed to improving election security. In addition, the Kremlin exploits the existence of insecure or outdated systems to promote information warfare operations against us, furthering the narrative that there are so-called cracks in our democracy.  Our government is not the only actor that must play a role in meeting these threats. We must also look to our society and the private sector. As I discussed, the government failed to have the imagination to fully realize the extent of the coming threat. Unfortunately, the ways in which the social media companies responded to these attacks mirrored the government's failure of imagination. Social media companies were held up as beacons of innovation with a view that technology could bring people together in common cause, but these companies failed to conceive that these same tools could also be used for malign purposes--to misinform as well as to inform.  When originally confronted with the notion that the Kremlin had had an impact on the 2016 election, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg dismissed out of hand any role his company may have played. He said: ``To think . . . [Facebook] influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.'' Yet we now know that the manipulation of social media is one of the primary lines of effort used by the Kremlin and Kremlin-linked actors to mount their information warfare campaigns against us.  Certain social media companies have made some reforms and worked with law enforcement and DHS to take down fraudulent networks--or what the companies deem as inauthentic accounts. For instance, late last month, Twitter announced that before the 2018 midterms, it removed 418 Russian accounts whose behavior mimicked that of the Kremlin-linked troll organization. However, we just can't assume, going forward, that these companies will act in the best interest of U.S. national security and continue to cooperate without some guidance or, perhaps, even regulation. These are private, for-profit companies, and like any company, they are worried how reputational damage will affect their bottom lines. If they cannot organize themselves effectively to combat warfare campaigns, Congress will have to legislate solutions.  Such an effort is already underway in the European Union, which has worked on several fronts to protect users of social media. The EU has established data privacy rules, known as the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, that seek to strengthen individual rights for the protection of personal data. In addition, the EU has worked with online platforms which are developing voluntary standards to fight disinformation, known as the Code of Practice on Disinformation. As well, EU member nations have also made threats of regulation and fines if social media companies do not do more to address disinformation and fake accounts. It would make sense to look closely at what the EU is implementing to see what might be appropriate for our purposes.  As I discussed in part 1 of this speech, one of the main issues in the 2016 election was that social media companies didn't have the visibility into what had occurred across platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and others, making it harder to detect and combat Russian information warfare operations. As mentioned previously, two independent reports commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee examined a subset of data provided by the social media companies relating to the 2016 election, and they identified significant Russian activity across social media platforms that was not discovered at the time.  As we look at how society must organize to counter this threat, we need greater visibility across platforms so that we can more effectively anticipate these operations coming and defend against future interference. One approach to further that goal could be the establishment of a social media repository to compile data relevant to identifying and countering foreign information operations. This database would be a tool for trusted independent researchers and academics to gain insight into cross-platform trends and provide an analysis of attacks.  To this point, last month, Cyber Commander General Nakasone testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the analysis of the independent reports, based on the limited data provided by a few social media companies, was ``very effective.''  He added:       As we prepared for the 2018 midterms, we took a very, very      close look at the information that was provided there. We      understood our adversary very well, and we understood where      their vulnerabilities also lie.  Imagine how helpful it would be if this repository were ongoing and comprehensive.  America's intelligence and defensive capabilities are vast and adaptable. To be sure, there is considerable work ahead to restructure, realign, and focus efforts across the government and society, but America will only be best postured to prevent these attacks in the future once we move from a defensive posture to a strategy that plays to our strengths.  We must come up with our own American playbook to counter Russian information warfare. The Kremlin has resorted to these dirty tricks because it knows it will not win in a fair fight. We should not try to play by their rules or be symmetric in our response. We should counter Russia in the arenas where we have strategic advantages. We should counter Russia in ways that uphold and enhance our democracy and the rule of law. We should counter Russia in ways that show our strength and credibility.  As President Reagan stated: ``The ultimate determinate in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas--a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the beliefs we cherish and the ideas to which we are dedicated.''  As I have explained, Kremlin and Kremlin-linked propaganda and disinformation seek to amplify fear and mistrust and convince the American public that our democracy is no better than the autocratic regime in Moscow. To push back against this moral equivalence promoted by Putin and other authoritarian regimes, we must promote and highlight our values. In doing so, we can showcase our adherence to justice and the rule of law by exposing Russian aggression against us, our allies, and our partners.  We must assist and protect journalism, including in countries where criticizing the Kremlin and exposing the truth may put reporters in danger. In concert with allies and partners, we must encourage and support civil society groups here and abroad to protect human rights and enhance rule of law protections. We can use sanctions as a tool to expose Kremlin abuses and raise reputational costs to Putin and his cronies, such as the sanctions provided in the Magnitsky Act.  Our American playbook must also include options for responding to Russian malign activities in cyberspace. The Russians are weaponizing information stolen from our government officials and candidates for public office. We must define and harden our cyber doctrine and clearly understand how to use our military in these new domains. Our responses are likely to be asymmetric rather than employing the same dirty tricks from the Russian playbook. Ultimately, the integrity of our electoral campaigns should lead all U.S. political parties and actors to pledge not to use hacked or stolen materials to attack or smear each other.  The media, too, should contemplate what its responsibilities are to the citizens of this country when covering elections. They should be wary of covering aspects of political campaigns in ways that may aid or abet foreign information operations. While we must always protect the constitutional right of freedom of the press, the media may come to conclude that covering hacked materials without appropriately framing the source of those materials or including comments from Kremlin-linked trolls claiming to be American citizens is no longer appropriate.  Further, as I discussed in part 1 of this speech, a major line of effort for Russia is Kremlin-directed deception operations using social media to penetrate our political and social debates and magnify feelings of fear and mistrust. Our American playbook must also include ways to educate our citizens with knowledge of these plots and provide additional media literacy tools, including teaching our young people how to evaluate what they see online and further make the case to the public for the importance and value of democratic institutions.  In addition, we must strengthen support for one of our greatest strategic advantages--our alliances and partnerships globally. We must take steps to educate the American public about the central role alliances play for our national security. We must also look outward, supporting our alliances and stepping up our diplomatic outreach to help resolve longstanding regional conflicts overseas so that Russia may no longer use information warfare campaigns to exploit those situations to their advantage.  Our responses to Russian information operations are most effective when we act in concert with allies and partners. The sanctions levied on Russia after their illegal annexation of Crimea were effective because they were implemented together with the EU. We have also witnessed the effects of the more than 25 countries expelling Russian diplomats in solidarity with the United Kingdom in response to the Skripal poisoning. The United States worked closely with Greece to blunt Russia's attempts to undermine an agreement between Greece and North Macedonia that would open the door for North Macedonia to join NATO. As these examples show, the cost to Russia is greater when they aren't simply dismissed as a unilateral shunning by the United States.  As the former Estonian Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Russia stated:       Joint initiatives are more likely to deter hackers. If they      don't take seriously one country, they will take seriously 30      countries when they will jointly blame a hacker or foreign      nation for an attack.  Last week, the Acting Attorney General and the Secretary of Homeland Security certified that our government ``concluded there is no evidence to date that any identified activities of a foreign government or foreign agent had a material impact on the integrity or security of election infrastructure or political/campaign infrastructure used in the 2018 midterm elections.''  However, we should not take that certification as a reason to let down our guard. We seem to be getting better at responding to the types of attacks perpetrated against the United States in 2016, but that is no indicator that we have become better at anticipating future attacks. The Director of the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned last November:       The [2018] midterm is . . . just the warm-up or the      exhibition game. . . . The big game for adversaries is      probably 2020.  This statement was reinforced by DNI Coats, who testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee late last month: ``Our adversaries and strategic competitors are probably already looking to the 2020 U.S. elections as an opportunity to advance their interests,'' and also ``Moscow may employ additional influence toolkits--such as spreading disinformation, conducting hack-and-leak operations or manipulating data--in a more targeted fashion to influence U.S. policy, actions and elections.''  We must think creatively to ensure that we are ahead of this curve. I am confident that this is a challenge that we can meet and conquer with Presidential leadership, a whole of government approach, and the energy and resources necessary. We can and we must do this. As President John F. Kennedy said: ``We are not here to curse the darkness but to light the candle that can guide us through that darkness to a safe and sane future.''  I yield the floor."

                "topic":"Public finances",
                "speech":"Mr. President, I had planned to come to the floor this evening to talk about our national parks and to talk about the lands bill that just passed, but I also want to talk for a moment, if I could, about the legislation we just voted on on this floor. It had to do with border security, and it had to do with six other appropriations bills that include many of our Departments and Agencies. It also had to do with keeping the government from shutting down. If this legislation is now passed by the House tonight, which is expected, and is signed into law by the President, which is expected, we will avoid a government shutdown, which is really important. We don't need to go there again.  I also want to talk, for a second, about the package itself and the most controversial part of it, which has to do with the border. I voted yes this evening, and I did so because the legislation we just signed takes really important steps towards strengthening our southern border. Frankly, I am not hearing much about that on either side of the aisle.  First, let me just say that President Trump had a proposal on the border. His was a comprehensive proposal--yes--of more barriers and fencing but also of more cameras, more remote sensing, more screening at ports of entry, more judges, more Border Patrol, and so on.  That legislation that he asked us to take up included $22.8 billion--a lot of money, right?  Now, some will say: But Congress didn't follow what President Trump wanted to do because they gave him less money.  The border security funding in this package is actually about $300 million less than the President asked for. It is $22.5 billion.  But Congress decided--and I think Congress is right about this--that our southern border is in need of help right now. Some call it a crisis. Some just say it is a big problem. I don't care what you call it. We need more help on the border. We need more barriers, but we also need more cameras, more remote sensing, and more ways to stop the drugs from coming in, most of which come through the ports of entry. Yes, we need more people to be able to respond. Yes, we need more judges to be able to handle this backlog of immigration cases that has built up. Yes, we need more humanitarian assistance.  By the way, the Trump administration and the Democrats from Congress supported both of those things. The place where there was a difference was the amount of funding to put into the barriers. They gave him less money than he asked for for new barriers and new fencing.  The agreement includes nearly $1.4 billion for that--for the new barriers and new fencing. By the way, it might also surprise you to learn that that is the most money Congress has ever appropriated for fencing and new barriers in any fiscal year.  Let me repeat that. This is the most money Congress has ever voted for to provide more barriers along the border. And these are new barriers.  Now, again, if you listen to folks--sometimes on both sides of the aisle--on this issue, you might not hear that, but this is the most ever in any one fiscal year. By the way, we are already 4 1/2  months into this fiscal year.  I am glad we provided the funding because I think it is needed. I believe we do have a crisis on the border. I believe it has to do with illegal immigration, but also it has to do with drugs that are devastating my home State of Ohio.  Crystal meth is on the rise--pure crystal meth from Mexico, almost all of it. Ninety percent of the heroin coming into my State comes across that southern border.  We now have fentanyl coming in from across the border in addition to coming straight from China. We now have, of course, cocaine coming across the southern border. We have serious drug problems that need to be addressed.  I have done a lot of work on the issue of human trafficking, and I can just tell you that what we have learned, sadly, is that the amount of trafficking going on along the southern border increases as you have more and more people who are trafficking human beings for work--illegal immigration, which I think is mostly for people coming here to find a better life for work, but they are bringing with them a lot of people who are trafficking women and children.  So the trafficking issue is real. That is what the experts tell us, and that is another reason for us to have a more secure southern border. So I am glad that we are providing the funding.  With regard to the new barriers, what the President had asked for is that his funding go to fund the top priorities of the Border Patrol. Customs and Border Protection has a border security improvement plan. You can check it out online. The border security improvement plan has a number of priorities. The President wanted to fund those priorities. This proposal that we voted on tonight does fund about 55 miles of new barriers--not just fixing up old barriers, but new barriers--which comprise the top two priorities of that border security plan.  Would the President like to do more in terms of barriers? Yes, he would, and he is talking about ways to do that.  But my point tonight is very simple. If you really care about the southern border, then, this was the right vote to take because, with regard to barriers, this is the most Congress has ever provided for new barriers, new fencing.  I hope this will work to help stop this flow of drugs into our country, to help control the illegal immigration that is happening, to help stop the trafficking of women and children that goes on along the border, but it is going to require more work. We all know that. This is a start, and my hope is that by passing this legislation we can help to start those even more serious efforts to deal with our broader issues here, including our broader immigration issues that have to be dealt with.  So I am hopeful that the House will pass it. I am hopeful that the President will sign it. I think he will. He says he will.  I am also glad that we are not going into a shutdown. Shutdowns make no sense. We have legislation, as some of you know, to try to stop government shutdowns from happening in the future. Why? Because they are bad for taxpayers, who end up paying more, not less, often because workers who are furloughed actually get paid even when they are not working, but also because of the inefficiencies of government during a shutdown. Taxpayer services are reduced--everything from meat inspection to the security lines, to the IRS information line to figure out how to file your doggone taxes. I mean, all of that gets affected.  So shutdowns don't make sense. It really doesn't make sense for the men and women who work for the Federal Government and for their families. During this last shutdown of 35 days, workers who were told they were essential, therefore, had to report for work, and they were not getting paid. So, again, those who weren't working got paid after the fact, and those who were working were not getting paid during the shutdown. That doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  By the way, missing two pay periods is a big deal for a lot of the government workers I know because they live paycheck to paycheck. They had rent payments. They had house payments, in some cases. They had car payments. They had real issues getting through this. Let's not put them through it again. It is not their fault. They shouldn't be pawns in this.  So my hope is that we can pass the ``end government shutdown'' legislation. It has 33 cosponsors now, which is a lot for around here, and it gets you started. A third of the Senate has said: Yes, let's stop these things. That is a big deal. My hope is that on both sides of the aisle our leadership agrees to take this to the floor. Let's have a vote on it. Let's decide whether people think shutdowns are a good idea or not. I think they are a bad idea.  By the way, it is the fifth Congress in which I have introduced this legislation, and I must say that we have never had this many cosponsors. So I do think more and more people are realizing that this is just not the way we ought to operate. It is no way to run a railroad or a government.                   National Resources Management Act  Earlier this week, as I was saying earlier, the Senate passed other legislation called the lands bill, but it is really about land conservation. It is about ensuring that we have the ability to protect treasures around our great country.  There were two provisions that were in this land bill that were very important for Ohio. One had to do with something called the Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area. You have probably heard of the Erie Canal. It ran through Ohio, New York, Pennsylvania, and other States. The national heritage area is a 110-mile route on that canal from Cleveland to New Philadelphia, OH. It follows the route of the canals that went along the Cuyahoga River. It is a beautiful, beautiful area. It is the 87-mile trail, which is now enjoyed by 2.5 million visitors a year, that we wanted to be sure to protect in this legislation.  I have been there, and my family has been there. It is a great place to hike and great place to bicycle. It is a great place to go bird watching. It is a great place just to enjoy time with your family.  It is our history that we are preserving. The canalway was established as a national heritage area by Congress in 1996, and although Congress has authorized funding for the Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area through fiscal year 2021, we had reached a funding cap this year, which meant we were at risk of losing about 100,000 bucks. That may not sound like much in the context of the Federal budget, but $100,000 is a big deal to the canalway. Why? Because we use the Federal money to leverage private money and State and local money, and it is a critical part of making sure that we continue to have this beautiful treasure in our State that brings 2.5 million visitors a year. It adds a lot of economic benefits to our area. So Senator Brown from Ohio and I have promoted this. We know that this limited Federal funding is going to be critical to leveraging those public-private partnerships, helping to create 4,200 jobs in the region and generating $408 million in economic benefits.  It is important to have that kind of stable funding in our heritage areas so they can continue to do what they do--to tell our Nation's rich history and to provide the recreational opportunities to the people I represent. So I am glad that was included in the land package.  There was also another piece of legislation that was passed. It was a bill that Senator Cardin from Maryland and I had been promoting called the Migratory Birds of the Americas Act, and it reauthorizes the Fish and Wildlife's program that promotes long-term conservation, research, and habitat protection for more than 380 different species of migratory birds.  This is a big deal to our State of Ohio. We are a big bird-watching State. We have a lot of migratory species, including our State bird, the cardinal.  George Voinovich, whose seat I hold, was a big champion for this program in his time in the Senate, and he used to talk about the importance of this from an economic point of view. It is true that bird watching brings more than 75,000 visitors a year to just one single birding event in Ohio. For the birders who are listening, you probably know it. It is in northwest Ohio at the Maumee Bay State Park. It is called the ``Biggest Week in American Birding,'' and polls have ranked it as the top birding event in the country. We like to think it is.  There is a study out of Bowling Green that indicates that bird watching around Lake Erie has contributed more than $26 million annually to our local economy--$26 million a year--and it has created almost 300 jobs.  So passage of this legislation is great news for us. It is about protecting that habitat in Ohio but also the habitat where these birds go in the wintertime. They are snow birds. They go south. We ensure they are going to come back and ensure we can continue to have that economic benefit and enjoy that natural beauty.  So I commend Senators Murkowski, Cantwell, and Manchin for working to get this legislation through the Senate. I look forward to the House's taking it up. It also has a good provision in there for helping our sportsmen and ensuring that we have public access to public lands. So my hope is that can move forward and we can ensure that we begin to deal with the issues that were addressed in that lands package.  One thing that was not addressed in the lands package that I want to be sure we don't lose sight of is the condition of our national parks.  Now, again, if you are going to talk about the treasures of our country, you have to put the national parks right at the top. We have this amazing park system that is the envy of some of the other countries around the world and the reason so many foreign visitors come to our country. The national parks now attract 330 million visitors annually. By the way, that is more visitors in the last few years than in the previous few years. So it is actually going up some.  These 330 million visitors come to see 84 million acres of parks and historical sites. Again, it is a huge economic boon to our country because a lot of people are coming from outside the country but also from the local areas, where people travel to get a beautiful vacation with their family, one they can afford. So we need to do everything we can do to hold our parks up.  Here is the problem. We have, over time, funded the parks' day-to-day operations but not funded their longer term maintenance problems. So think of a building that has a roof that is leaking. Now we are funding the program within that building and the naturalists, but what we are not funding is the actual reconstruction of that building. It is called a maintenance backlog. That backlog has grown and grown and grown over the years to the point that we now have a $12 billion maintenance backlog in our parks, and the park funding that we provide every year can't come close to providing that funding. So what some of us have done over the years is tried to bring attention to this and to figure out a way to get funding that was specifically focused on how to ensure that our national parks don't continue to deteriorate.  Again, they are such a beautiful part of our country, our history, and our culture. We have to preserve that legacy.  In Ohio, we have eight national parks, including Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Cuyahoga Valley National Park is one of the top 14 visited parks in the country. We are very proud of that. Whether it is biking, hiking, fishing, or kayaking, 2.7 million visitors a year go to Cuyahoga Valley. I am one of them. I like to do all of that there.  So these parks need to be sure that they can continue to be this treasure for the future. The infrastructure--the water infrastructure, the roads, the buildings, the bridges--is all deteriorating to the point where actually some of it can't be used.  If you go to a national park today, you may see that there is a trail closed or there is a visitors center that can't be visited. You may see that some of the campgrounds are closed or some of the bathrooms are closed because those facilities have not been able to keep up with their deferred maintenance.  So I think we should be putting more money into deferred maintenance and bringing our parks up to speed and addressing this $12 billion backlog than the idea of expanding parks. We ought to be focused more on the stewardship of the parks we have, and that $12 billion is impossible to find within the parks' budget that we have.  Think about your own house. If you allow deferred maintenance to build up and you don't take care of the roof, as an example, what happens? Well, you get a leak in the roof and then pretty soon your drywall is ruined, and I am pretty sure you would find out that your floor is ruined, and the costs mount up. That is what is happening in our parks. So we are not fixing the deferred maintenance, and we are creating other costs and other problems, and I have seen it. I have gone to four of our larger parks in Ohio to see, specifically, what their priorities are in terms of deferred maintenance.  One is a leaky roof. Another is a bridge. Another is part of a railroad track that runs through it, a tourism railroad track. Another is a seawall on Lake Erie. If that is not fixed, it then causes other damage.  My hope is that we can, on a bipartisan basis, deal with this because these problems compound. They get worse and worse if you don't deal with them. We can't wait any longer to address these maintenance needs.  Even though we don't have Yellowstone Grand Teton, or Yosemite in Ohio--we don't have huge parks like those--we have a $100 million backlog in deferred maintenance in our smaller parks in Ohio--$100 million.  I toured Cuyahoga Valley National Park with Superintendent Craig Kenkel and Deb Yandala, who is CEO of the Conservancy for Cuyahoga Valley National Park. Deb is also president of the national association of friends groups for our parks. These friends groups are fantastic. They provide a lot of funding for the parks, private sector funding. I think that is an incredibly important part of our overall park funding, but they can't afford these maintenance projects either.  Today, there is more than $45 million at Cuyahoga Valley alone in unmet maintenance needs--$875,000 for badly needed renovations for their welcome center. I have been there. I have seen it. They need it. More than $3 million is needed to renovate parking lots that are crumbling, and more than $2 million is needed for trail repair for the extensive trail system throughout the park.  I have also been to other parks in Ohio and have seen what some of the deferred maintenance is. At the Perry's Victory & International Peace Memorial up on Lake Erie, $47.7 million is needed in long-delayed maintenance, which includes millions to repair the cracks in the seawall there to enable the rest of the monument to continue to exist, and the visitor's center has to be made ADA compatible and needs repairs.  Everything we talk about here in terms of the parks is normally very positive. Democrats and Republicans alike love the parks. People in America love our parks. But I think they are surprised to learn that just underneath the surface, our parks are crumbling. We have to do more to ensure they are going to be enjoyed for generations to come.  From 2006 until 2017, annual visitation increased by 58 million people. As these needs are growing, more people are coming, putting more and more pressure on the parks. Keeping up with this aging infrastructure and increased visitation has really stretched the Park Service and required them to focus on just the very immediate maintenance needs and postpone or delay these other projects. We can't continue to use these bandaids. We have to address the underlying issue.  I feel this is a debt unpaid. This is deferred maintenance that has built up over the last couple of decades that we should have addressed and we didn't, and now we need to go back and do it to ensure that it doesn't cause additional costs. So this week, I have reintroduced legislation I have worked on in the last three Congresses. I have reintroduced it with three of my colleagues--Senator Mark Warner from Virginia, Senator Lamar Alexander from Tennessee, and Senator Angus King from Maine. Two Republicans, one Democrat, and one Independent--that makes it tri-partisan. It is called the Restore Our Parks Act--a commonsense solution to deal with this $12 billion backlog of long-overdue maintenance projects.  I thank my colleagues for stepping up and working on this together, and we have. We have had different proposals out there. Senator Warner came up with the idea of using offshore and onshore revenue from oil and gas drilling. We combined with the bill that Senator Alexander and Senator King had put forward. There are others who have great ideas. Senator Steve Daines from Montana is one of our strong supporters. He is chair of the National Parks Subcommittee of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. As he said, he grew up in the shadow of Yellowstone Park. We have lots of colleagues on both sides of the aisle who care about this and are involved, and I thank them for their hard work.  Senator Alexander told me that in the 100-year history of our national parks, there has never been a single bill more important than this one. That is saying a lot. Since Teddy Roosevelt decided to acquire this land for our national parks, there have been lots of ways we have tried to help the parks, including, recently, legislation that I drafted on the centennial of the parks that helps us get more public and private money into the parks. That is good, but it is not enough to handle these incredible--$12 billion--deferred maintenance costs we have now.  The legislation creates what is called a legacy restoration fund, which will get half of all the annual energy revenues over the next 5 years that are not otherwise allocated, and it will be used for priority deferred maintenance projects. These are royalties from onshore and offshore energy development. The Trump administration is doing more of that development, so there is more revenue coming in. The bill caps the deposits into the fund at $1.3 billion annually, so no matter what, even if there is a lot more money coming in, we will have a cap of $1.23 billion annually, which will provide a total of $6.5 billion for deferred maintenance projects over the next 5 years.  I said $12 billion earlier, and that is the amount, but for the urgent priorities, it is about $6.5 billion. That is how we came up with that number. So what we are trying to do is--at least let's address the urgent priorities in the next 5 years using the revenues coming into our government from these offshore and onshore energy projects, oil and gas projects. Again, if it is allocated for something else, like the Land and Water Conservation Fund, we don't touch it. It is just funding that is not already allocated somewhere else.  Last year, we had 37 cosponsors here in the Senate for this legislation, Republicans and Democrats alike--more than one-third of this Chamber.  A similar House bill, our House companion bill, had 234 Members cosponsoring it--more than the 218 needed, more than the majority.  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported this bill out on a bipartisan basis last fall. I was on the committee. We had a good debate on it. We reported it out with a 19-to-4 vote. There is not a lot we do around here that is that bipartisan.  We received overwhelming support from conservation and outdoor recreation groups. This includes the National Parks Conservation Association, the Outdoor Industry Alliance, the Trust for Public Land, the Pew Charitable Trusts, and others. At our hearing we had on the legislation last year, the director of the Pew Charitable Trusts said it well: ``Supporting this bipartisan bill is a wise investment for our National Parks System and has overwhelming support from the American public, generates hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars for the economy each year and provides access to world class recreation opportunities and helps preserve our nation's history.''  Yes, the parks do all of that. That is why it is so important that we preserve them and ensure that this long-term problem gets addressed now.  I am proud to introduce legislation in the Senate this week, and I am proud that the House companion bill is being introduced today by Representatives Bishop and Kilmer. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this bill across the finish line. I thank the Senators who have already signed up as cosponsors. I hope we can continue to build support for this and get this commonsense bill done to help preserve our national treasures.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "topic":"Honoring",
                "speech":"Madam President, I arrived in the U.S. Congress in January 1983--a new Congressman from downstate Illinois, the son of an immigrant mother--and I was in awe.  Just listen to this list of House Committee chairmen back then: chairman of the Rules Committee: Claude Pepper; Judiciary chairman: Peter Rodino; Veterans Affairs chairman: Sonny Montgomery; Interior Committee chairman: Mo Udall; Ways and Means Committee chairman: Danny Rostenkowski.  Yet even among these legends, John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, stood out. He was a giant among giants, and not just because he stood 6 foot 3. A 26-year veteran of the House at the time, he was revered as the architect of Medicare and a driving force behind some of the most important civil rights and environmental laws in America's history. He went on to become the longest serving member of Congress in American history. But it is the quality and courage of John Dingell's service, even more than its length, that made John Dingell one of the most influential legislators of all time. He helped write most of the Nation's major environmental and energy laws. He helped save the American auto industry twice: in 1979 and again during the great recession.  His nickname--``Big John''--was a reflection not only of his commanding height but also of his moral stature. Of the more than 25,000 votes he cast in Congress, the one he as most proud of was his vote in support of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. That vote led to a brutal reelection fight later that year. It was the second time John Dingell ever had a cross burned on his lawn and the closest he ever come to losing a race. But John Dingell was unbowed. He went on to champion the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and--many more major civil rights laws.  John David Dingell, Jr, was born in 1926, the eldest of three children. His family, he once said, was as ``poor as Job's chicken.''  In 1932, when John was 6 years old, his father was elected to Congress, where he became a leading champion of the New Deal. He stood behind FDR as he signed the law creating Social Security.  In 1943, John Senior introduced America's first national health insurance bill--to help seniors and children from poor families. The bill never passed.  In 1955, John Senior died in office from tuberculosis. That same year, at the age of 29, his son was chosen in a special election to finish his father's term.  At the start of every new Congress, John Dingell introduced a bill to create a Medicare Program to provide health insurance for older adults. He never gave up on fulfilling his father's dream. When Medicare finally came up for a vote in 1965, he was given honor of presiding over the House, in memory of his father. He lent the gavel he had used that day to Speaker Nancy Pelosi when the House voted to pass the Affordable Care Act in 2010. John Dingell sat by President Obama's side when he signed the Affordable Care Act into law in 2010. Millions and millions of Americans can afford to see a doctor today and retire with a bit of security and dignity because of John Dingell.  Chairman Dingell's father taught him that public service through politics can be a noble calling. He treated everyone with dignity. He cared about people who struggle, as his own family struggled when he was young. The priest who officiated at his funeral mass in Dearborn yesterday told a story about a woman who approached him recently and told him, ``If not for John Dingell, I would not have been able to put food on the table.''  Last week, on the day he died, John Dingell dictated some reflections to his wife, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell. She was John's partner and his rock for 40 years, and she now holds the seat that John and his father once held. John's ``parting thoughts,'' as he called them, were published in the Washington Post. They are profoundly moving and wise. One in particular stands out for me. Chairman Dingell said that it always grated on him to hear it said that a person ``has'' power. ``In democratic government,'' he wrote, ``elected officials do not have power. They hold power--in trust for the people who elected them.''  I'll close with one last story--one final more bit of wisdom--from my friend John Dingell.  In 1944, when he turned 18, John enlisted in the U.S. Army. The following year, he was supposed to be among the first wave of American soldiers to invade mainland Japan. Only the surrender of Japan saved him from what would have been near-certain death. All of his life, he remained proud of his service and deeply committed to other veterans and to their families.  When President George H. W. Bush died shortly after Thanksgiving, Chairman Dingell wrote a posthumous tribute--the last World War II veteran to serve in Congress, writing to honor the last World War II veteran to occupy the Oval Office. It was published in the Detroit News. This is what John Dingell wrote:       Both of us understood how fragile this American democracy      was and the atrocities that were occurring in the world. Both      of us signed up immediately when war was declared and knew      our moral responsibility to defend America and fight for the      freedom of mankind.  He went on to say:       We were from a political generation that understood      delivering for the American people was more important than      political wins. The success of government and good public      policy is the success of hard-working men and women.  He closed with a plea, almost a prayer:       May the stories of my good friend help us find our way back      to a society that promotes dialogues, not demagogues, and      that it helps us to remember we, the people, have the ability      to restore this great nation to common ground rather than      letting it continue its downward spiral into constant chaos.  In closing, Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to John's wife, the love of his life, Congresswoman Debbie Dingell moreover, to John's three surviving children: Chip, Christopher, and Jennifer; and their families, including John's three grandchildren; to his brother and sister; his countless friends and the countless more who thought of him as a friend and mourn his passing."

                "speech":"Madam President, in his tortuous attempt to make a case for billions of taxpayer dollars to wall off our southern border, President Trump claimed that a wall would stop human trafficking, which has been touted as a priority of this administration.  On several occasions, the President has depicted human trafficking as women and girls smuggled across the border with their hands and legs tied and duct tape across their mouths. No doubt there are such cases, but the overwhelming majority of trafficking victims in this country are U.S. citizens, and among non-citizen victims, nearly 80 percent cross through legal points of entry. As we have seen time and again, President Trump makes short shrift of the truth and relies on scare tactics, rather than evidence, to gamer support for his misguided policies.  Not only would the President's border wall do next to nothing to combat the most common instances of human trafficking in the United States, his administration's policies have actually harmed trafficking victims, especially non-citizen victims.  Last year, the administration announced that applicants who are denied a T visa--an immigrant visa that enables certain victims of sex or labor trafficking to temporarily remain in the United States--may be required to appear in immigration court, the first step in deportation proceedings. This policy has reportedly had a self-censoring effect on victims and victims' advocates who are hesitant to apply or to encourage their clients to apply for a visa that may ultimately land them in immigration court. The administration also eliminated grant funding for criminal record sealing or expungement for survivors of human trafficking, previously made available by the Department of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime. Survivors may have a criminal record associated with their trafficking, such as an arrest for prostitution or for a charge tangential to their trafficking such as loitering or theft. Helping survivors clear their criminal record is a critical step in their recovery, one that gives survivors a greater chance at securing stable employment, affordable housing, higher education, visas and green cards, and more.  So once again, we are forced to try to reconcile the President's rhetoric with the actions of his administration. They don't align. If this White House were serious about combating human trafficking, it would focus less on creating a false narrative about trafficking across our southern border and instead devote the resources to ensure that trafficking victims can come forward knowing they will be protected and assisted on their path to recovery."

                "speech":"Madam President, I want to commend Senator Klobuchar for introducing the Freedom to Export to Cuba Act, of which I and Senator Enzi are cosponsors. I urge other Senators to join us.  This bill is about ending the anachronistic prohibitions in U.S. law that for decades have limited U.S. engagement with Cuba, including preventing American companies from exporting their products to Cuba. The fact that legislation to do so is even necessary is illustrative of the absurdity of the situation in which we find ourselves. Companies from Europe, Russia, China, Mexico, and every other country can sell their products to Cuba, which is just 90 miles from our coast, but American manufacturers and retailers are largely shut out of the Cuban market.  For example, Cuba buys rice from Vietnam and powdered milk from New Zealand, half a world away, not from Alabama, Vermont, or Michigan. That makes no sense. This bill would enable American companies to compete, which every believer in a free market should support.  It is also important for Senators to know that punitive actions by the Trump administration last year to further restrict the right of Americans to travel to Cuba have had devastating consequences for Cuba's fledgling private sector, the very people the White House and supporters of the restrictions profess to want to help. The fact that they have said nothing about the harm they are causing Cuba's struggling entrepreneurs demonstrates that they care more about continuing their failed policy of sanctions, regardless of who they hurt, than about helping the Cuban people or about protecting the right of Americans to travel freely.  The latest ill-conceived attempt by the White House to punish Cuba would permit Title III of the Helms-Burton Act to go into effect. This would allow, among others, individuals who were Cuban citizens when their property in Cuba was expropriated half a century ago to sue in U.S. courts any Cuban, foreign, and even American company whose business in Cuba today uses that property. That could be an airport, port, warehouse, hotel, restaurant, you name it. Virtually every American and foreign company investing in Cuba would suddenly be liable for treble damages.  The purpose, as the law's authors made clear when it was enacted 23 years ago, is to harm Cuba's economy by making it completely inhospitable for foreign investment.  As my friend in the House, Representative Jim McGovern, has pointed out;       ``It's no mystery why Presidents Clinton, Bush, Obama, and      Trump blocked Title III from going into effect every six      months for the past 23 years.       It is hypocritical--it penalizes companies for doing what      American companies do all over the world.       It is contrary to international law, which recognizes the      right of expropriation and requires compensation.       It is an extraterritorial sanction that guarantees a      response from our trading partners, like Canada, Spain and      the EU, including complaints at the World Trade Organization.       And if you care about agriculture, be warned: It will open      a new front in the trade war, with all the repercussions that      can bring.       It will allow Cuba to claim victim status and rally      international support.       It will clog our courts with lawsuits.       It will make it impossible to negotiate compensation for      U.S. claims in Cuba, and, in the end, hurt the very Americans      who seek compensation for the property they lost.       It will divide us from friends and allies who are now      working for a peaceful solution in Venezuela.       And it will guarantee that new investment in Cuba will come      from the Russians, Chinese and others who are hostile to the      United States, and whose state-owned companies can't be sued      in U.S. courts.''  I agree with my friend in the other body. What the White House is considering would trigger an avalanche of unintended consequences that would bring U.S. commerce with Cuba to a halt, harm relations with our allies in this hemisphere and beyond, and make resolving property claims more difficult. I ask unanimous consent that a piece by William Leogrande on Title III of the Helms-Burton Act published in the February 13, 2019 issue of OnCubaNews be printed in the Record following my remarks.  Like many issues, Members of Congress have strong feelings pro and con about U.S. relations with Cuba. It is no secret that, after more than half a century of a policy of isolation that has achieved none of its objectives and primarily hurt the Cuban people, I, like Senators Klobuchar and Enzi and many others in this body, favor closer relations.  Conversely, there are those in Congress and the Trump administration who believe strongly that we should ratchet up the pressure on the Cuban Government in an attempt to achieve those elusive goals.  I have often spoken publicly about the lack of political freedom and civil liberties in Cuba, but I also think it is important to try to be objective: to criticize when called for and to acknowledge positive changes when they occur.  I recognize that those who favor maintaining the failed economic embargo have a longstanding, visceral antagonism and resentment toward the Cuban Government. While they rarely, if ever, mention the corrupt and brutal Batista regime that enjoyed unqualified U.S. support until it was overthrown in 1959, they have legitimate reasons to criticize the mistreatment of the Cuban people by the current government and its support for the corrupt and repressive Maduro regime in Venezuela.  But they too should acknowledge that threatening and bullying Cuba has not worked. In fact, it has made the situation worse and provided an excuse for the Cuban Government to blame its own failures on us. They should also acknowledge positive changes in Cuba, but they never do--not ever. It is almost as if they are psychologically, ideologically, or emotionally incapable of saying one positive thing about the Cuban Government, no matter what positive things it does.  Perhaps they are afraid that, if they did, they would alienate their donors in the Cuban-American community. Of course, we know that Cuban-Americans are divided about the U.S. embargo. Some are hardcore believers in the embargo, and they always will be. But at least as many--and increasing numbers--oppose the embargo, especially those who were born after the Cuban revolution.  I wonder what the pro-embargo isolationists would say if the Cuban Government were to stop harassing and abusing dissidents who favor a more democratic system. Would those who oppose the embargo say anything positive?  What if the Cuban Government decided to embrace a free market economy and let private businesses flourish? Would those who oppose the embargo say anything positive?  I doubt it. I doubt it because no matter what positive reforms occur in Cuba, they will continue to defend the embargo until Cuba is a full-fledged democracy and those who currently hold power either die or are voted out of office.  We all want Cuba to become a democracy, where civil and political rights are respected, and the sooner the better, but those same defenders of the embargo support billions of dollars in U.S. aid--and weapons sales--to countries that are led by authoritarian, brutal, and corrupt dictatorships and monarchies, some of which have held power for decades or generations. How do the pro-embargo diehards reconcile that? They don't, and they can't.  The fact is, Cuba is changing--not nearly as fast as we and the Cuban people would like, but it is changing in ways that few would have predicted not very long ago.  Last year, Raul Castro's hand-picked successor, Miguel Diaz-Canel, became President, and he promised a government more accessible and responsive to the people's needs. How he delivers on that promise remains to be seen.  Since 2010, after the Cuban Government recognized that the internet is essential if Cuba wants to be part of the modern world, internet access has exploded. The government has opened hundreds of public Wi-Fi hot spots and cyber cafes in the past 5 years, and home internet access became legal and available in 2017. Today, almost half of the Cuban people have personal cellphones that were illegal just a decade ago.  As others have pointed out, these changes have encouraged new forms of communication, networking, and organizing via social media.  But change does not come easily in Cuba, as it does not in many countries. Last July, the government announced onerous new regulations on the private sector, covering a wide range of issues: food safety, labor contracts, procurement, taxation, limits on the size of private businesses. The new rules were an attempt by hardliners to crack down on the private sector, which was criticized for black marketeering.  But private entrepreneurs resisted, and they challenged the regulations as contradictory to the government's own plans that recognizes the private sector as important to economic growth and employment. They appealed to government officials and spoke publicly about the harm the new rules would have on their businesses.  When the final regulations were issued, several that had caused the most resentment were dropped. According to the Minister of Labor and Social Security, the decision to revise the rules was due to ``the opinion and experiences of those directly involved.''  The government also retreated on a new law--Decree 349--requiring artists, musicians, and performers to register with the state and pay a large commission on their earnings from private engagements, and it banned work with objectionable content and empowered inspectors to shut down any offensive exhibition or performance. Clearly, an attempt to further limit free expression.  Since the 1980s, Cuban artists have had more freedom to be critical of the government than other social sectors, and so it was not surprising that Decree 349 ignited widespread protests. After social media was used to mobilize opposition within the Cuban arts community and among artists abroad, the government agreed not to enforce the law until implementing regulations are drafted in consultation with the arts community.  According to one observer, ``during [the latter half of last year], nearly 8.9 million Cubans debated the draft of a new constitution in their workplaces, neighborhoods and schools. Communist Party members were told not to argue with even the most radical proposals for amendments, and the ensuing debates were freewheeling, often lasting past their scheduled time. Among the main topics: whether the president and state governors should be directly elected by voters; whether the concentration of wealth and property should be allowed; whether term limits and age limits for leaders were a good idea; and whether the Communist Party should be subordinated to the constitution and hence the law.'' Not long ago it would have been unthinkable to openly debate these issues, especially as part of a constitutional reform process.  One article that attracted intense debate recognized same-sex marriage and was promoted by Raul Castro's daughter, a long-time activist for LGBTQ rights. The proposal sparked strong opposition from evangelical churches supported by the Catholic Church. Gay rights advocates countered with campaigns of their own. The chance of a significant ``no'' vote on the entire constitutional reform led the government to drop the provision from the final draft of the constitution with a pledge to consider it later.  This surge in mobilization by well-organized constituencies utilizing social media to resist government policy, from burdensome private sector regulations to gay marriage, is unprecedented in Cuba. The government's willingness to not only tolerate these organized challenges but to change policies in response to them is significant.  As has been noted, none of these issues dealt with the rigid structure of the Cuban system. Cuba remains a one-party state, in which those who challenge the system are treated as criminals, but the precedent of organized interest groups mounting successful campaigns to challenge and change government policy is now established, which is positive.  None of the longstanding critics of the Cuban Government in the U.S. Congress or the Cuban-American community have acknowledged any of this, nor are they likely to. For them, anything less than a wholesale change of government in Cuba is unworthy of mention, even though they apply a very different standard--a double standard--to other authoritarian governments. In fact, they would ridicule anyone who regards such changes as positive or worthy of recognition.  As we know from our own experience, political reform is difficult. Our own Electoral College, an anachronism designed to protect a slave-holding minority, remains in effect more than two centuries later. Five times, in the world's oldest democracy, it has prevented the winner of the most popular votes from being elected President.  The Cuban people want to live better and they want a lot less government control over their lives. Armed with cellphones and the internet, they are going to make increasing demands of their government. This is happening at a time when Venezuela's economy is collapsing and the survival of the Maduro regime, Cuba's closest ally in the hemisphere, is in question. Not surprisingly, the Cuban Government is trying to limit the pace of change and to secure other benefactors. It is turning increasingly to Russia, Algeria, Iran, and other countries that welcome the chance to challenge U.S. influence in this hemisphere.  This is a time for the United States to be actively and visibly engaged in Cuba, for Americans to be traveling to Cuba, for expanding educational, cultural, and professional exchanges between the U.S. and Cuba, and for American companies to be competing in Cuba. It is not a time to return to a failed policy of threats and ultimatums, driven by domestic politics rather than by what is in our national interests.  That is why I am cosponsoring the Freedom to Export to Cuba Act, and it is why I intend to support other bipartisan legislation to replace our failed Cuba policy with one that serves America's interests, not the interests of a shrinking minority, and not the interests of Russia and other countries that are reaping the economic benefits of our self-defeating policy of isolation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: he Trump administration is seriously considering whether      to allow Title III of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic      Solidarity Act (Helms-Burton) to go into effect in March,      according to National Security Adviser John Bolton. On      January 16, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that he      was suspending Title III for just 45 days instead of the      usual six months while the administration reviews whether its      implementation would promote democracy in Cuba. He warned      foreign companies doing business on the island that they had      better ``reconsider whether they are trafficking in      confiscated property and abetting this dictatorship.''       Title III allows U.S. nationals to file suit in U.S. courts      against anyone ``trafficking'' in their confiscated property      in Cuba--that is, anyone profiting from it. If President      Trump allows Title III to go fully into effect, he will open      the door to as many as 200,000 law suits by U.S. nationals,      most of them Cuban Americans, whose property was taken by the      Cuban government after 1959. U.S. courts would be swamped,      the ability of U.S. companies to do business on the island      would be crippled, and allies abroad might retaliate for U.S.      suits brought against their companies in Cuba. Once the suits      have been filed, there will be no way to undo the resulting      legal chaos and the tangle of resulting litigation could take      years to unwind.       The U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission has certified      5,913 claims of U.S. nationals whose property was seized.      These are the claims that Cuba recognizes and that the United States      and Cuba had begun to discuss during the Obama      administration. But Title III takes the unusual position of      allowing naturalized Cuban Americans who lost property to      also file suit against alleged traffickers. Normally,      international law recognizes the sovereign right of      governments to dispose of the property of their own citizens.      According to the Department of State, by including Cuban      Americans who were not U.S. citizens when their property was      taken, Title III creates the potential for an estimated      75,000-200,000 claims worth ``tens of billions of dollars.''       Back in 1996, when the law was being debated in Congress,      angry opposition from U.S. allies Canada, Mexico, and the      European Union, whose companies doing business in Cuba would      be the targets of Title III law suits, led President Bill      Clinton to insist on a presidential waiver provision in Title      III. As a result, the president has the authority to suspend      for six months the right to file Title III law suits, and he      can renew that suspension indefinitely. Every six months      since the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act was      passed, successive presidents, Democrat and Republican alike,      have continued the suspension of Title III.       U.S. allies have denounced Title III's extraterritorial      reach. Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the European      Union all passed laws prohibiting compliance with it. The      European Union also filed a complaint with the World Trade      Organization, which it did not pursue after President Clinton      suspended Title III. In fact, the principal justification      both President Clinton and President George W. Bush offered      for continuing the suspension was the need to maintain      cooperation with European allies.       If President Trump does not renew the suspension, all these      old wounds with allies will be reopened as U.S. claimants try      to haul foreign companies into U.S. courts for doing business      in Cuba. We already have enough tough issues on our agenda      with Mexico, Canada, and Europe without adding another one.      At this very moment, Washington is trying to muster their      support in dealing with the Venezuelan crisis, support that      could be endangered if the administration picks a fight with      them over Title III.       U.S. businesses would not be exempt from potential      liability. A Cuban American family in Miami claims to have      owned the land on which Jose Marti International Airport was      built, so any U.S. carrier using the air field could      conceivably be sued under Title III. Another family that      owned the Port of Santiago could file suit against U.S.      cruise ships docking there.       Moreover, it would be almost impossible for a U.S. or      foreign company to know in advance whether a proposed      business opportunity in Cuba might become the subject of      Title III litigation. ``This will effectively end for decades      any attempt to restore trade between the U.S. and Cuba,''      attorney Robert Muse told the Tampa Bay Times.       When President Trump announced new sanctions on Cuba back      in June 2017, senior administration officials said they were      designed ``to not disrupt existing business'' that U.S.      companies were doing in Cuba. If the president fails to      continue the suspension of Title III, business relations will      be disrupted far more severely and irreparably than they      would be by any regulatory change."

In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 allow the chairman of the Budget Committee to establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels consistent with those adjustments.  The Senate will soon consider the conference report for H.J. Res. 31, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 This measure provides full-year appropriations for Federal Government agencies and contains spending that qualifies for cap adjustments under current statute.  This measure includes $8,165 million in budget authority that is designated as being for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of BBEDCA. Of that amount, $165 million is for spending in the security category and $8,000 million is for nonsecurity spending. CBO estimates that this budget authority will result in $2,980 million in outlays in Fiscal Year 2019.  This measure also includes $12,000 million in nonsecurity discretionary budget authority designated for disaster relief pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(D) of BBEDCA. This designation makes the spending associated with this provision and its associated outlays of $600 million eligible for an adjustment.  This legislation repurposes nonsecurity discretionary budget authority for emergency efforts. This funding is designated pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. CBO estimates that this repurposing of funds will result in $10 million in outlays this fiscal year.  As a result of the aforementioned designations, I am revising the budget authority and outlay allocations to the Committee on Appropriations by increasing revised security budget authority by $165 million, revised nonsecurity budget authority by $20,000 million, and outlays by $3,590 million in Fiscal Year 2019. Further, I am increasing the budgetary aggregate for Fiscal Year 2019 by $20,165 million in budget authority and $3,590 million in outlays.

                "speech":"Madam President, along with my colleagues Senator Mike Crapo and Representative Mike Simpson, I recognize an important anniversary being celebrated at the U.S. Department of Energy's, DOE, 890-square-mile site in eastern Idaho.  On February 18, 1949, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission decided to build the National Reactor Testing Station in Idaho.  For 70 years, work done by the scientists, engineers, technicians, and support staff at Idaho's lab has helped promote American prosperity and contributed to our national security.  Since 1967, research conducted at Idaho National Laboratory's, INL, Advanced Test Reactor has powered and modernized the U.S. Nuclear Navy.  Fifty years ago, the Navy had to refuel its nuclear fleet frequently, an expensive and time-consuming process.  Today, as a result of experiments conducted at the Advanced Test Reactor, ATR, the Navy's nuclear fleet can run the lifetime of the ship--more than three decades--without refueling. That saves American taxpayers millions of dollars and ensures that our fleet is actively defending U.S. national security instead of sitting in port waiting to be refueled.  Roughly a decade and a half ago, Congress designated INL as the Nation's lead nuclear energy research and development laboratory. This is fitting because on December 20, 1951, INL first demonstrated nuclear fission could be used to generate power to light our homes and cities. Throughout its history, INL has built and operated 52 original nuclear reactors and helped establish an American industry that today produces approximately 19 percent of our Nation's electricity and more than half of our carbon-free electricity. INL has become a world leader in cyber security research and works actively with government and industry to protect and make the Nation's most critical infrastructure more resilient. INL has advanced broader clean energy research, informing electric vehicle deployment and developing bioenergy solutions that benefit the environment and our Nation's farmers. Even as we celebrate INL's 70 years, the lab's leadership and staff are looking ahead. Those seven decades of service provide a foundation upon which today's INL will help this Nation build a brighter future. INL leads the effort to maintain and extend the lives of America's nuclear reactor fleet, while helping industry develop advanced reactor designs, including small modular reactors and microreactors. INL's vital national and homeland security work grows more important every day as our systems become increasingly automated and interdependent.  As we eye the energy systems that will power U.S. prosperity into the future, INL's clean energy research is developing breakthroughs that will help integrate renewables into the power grid and allow our manufacturing and transportation systems to operate more efficiently and with less environmental impact.  It is our great honor to congratulate INL and DOE on this important anniversary, and to wish its employees well as they work to resolve our nation's pressing clean energy and national security challenges."

Brendan is smart, funny, kind, and creative, with a deep respect for our Nation's history and institution and a genuine, intense passion for public service.  Over the past 5 1/2  years, Brendan has put the needs and challenges of people from across Delaware first. Brendan worked on my constituent outreach and communication teams, serving as veterans advocate, staff photographer, and press assistant. In total, Brendan resolved more than 1,500 cases for constituents and in his last year alone produced more than 350 documents and postings for our communications team.  Brendan has also served with distinction in the U.S. Army, Delaware National Guard, Hawaii National Guard, twice overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, as a first responder following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Maria, and served as an AmeriCorps volunteer with the Corporation for National and Community Service.  Brendan's ability to balance his workload while focusing on his own professional development was equally admirable. While on my team, he graduated from Wilmington University in 2014, Officer Candidate Schoo1 in 2015, Military Intelligence School in 2016, and Air Assault School in 2017. These milestones have strengthened Brendan's capacity as a leader and have increased his knowledge of defense and intelligence matters.  Tomorrow, Brendan will finish his service with my Senate office and soon after will join the staff of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, where I know he will be a zealous advocate for members of the military and veteran community. His colleagues--now friends--who enjoy his wit and wisdom will miss him. While we will miss his regular anecdotes laced with historical references, we know we will continue to enjoy his ``on this day'' Facebook posts and updates as he continues to read biographies on every American president.  In sum, Brendan stood out amongst my staff and demonstrated a level of intelligence, analytical ability, character, and a devotion that will serve him well in the future. I will miss his insights and his constant focus on making things better for the constituents we serve, and I look forward to hearing about his successes to come."

Throughout her career, Councilwoman Reynolds Brown has worked to improve the lives of Philadelphians as an educator, community activist, and political leader.  The oldest of seven children, Blondell Reynolds Brown was born in Sumter, SC, to Sadie Reynolds, a schoolteacher, and the late Whittimore Reynolds, who worked in construction. At the age 5, Reynolds Brown and her family moved to Philadelphia, where she would go on to graduate from the Philadelphia High School for Girls.  Councilwoman Reynolds Brown demonstrated an early proclivity for public service. Following her graduation from Pennsylvania State University, she was on track to join the Peace Corps, but instead decided to start her service in Philadelphia and teach in the city's public schools.  In 1999, Reynolds Brown was elected to one of seven at-large city council seats. It was her time as a legislative aide for a State senator that inspired her initial decision to run for city council. During this time, Reynolds Brown noticed a lack of Black women in leadership roles and led her own efforts to promote equity and diversity in public office.  During her time in office, Reynolds Brown has championed meaningful legislation in service of children, women, arts and culture, education, small business development, and the environment and sustainability. Councilwoman Reynolds Brown's major legislative accomplishments include the creation of the Fund for Children, the establishment of requirements for menu labeling within Philadelphia, the implementation of sexual harassment training for city of Philadelphia employees, the overhaul of the parks and recreation system, and the expansion of domestic partner benefits within city contractors. She also did a great deal to advocate for the appointment of woman to board positions and helped leverage funding for mentorship, early childhood education, the arts, and Philadelphia tourism.  Beyond her work on city council, Reynolds Brown is an active member of the Philadelphia community. She is a board member of the Philadelphia Convention and Visitor's Bureau, the Marian Anderson Award, Philadelphia Young Playwrights, the Greater Philadelphia Cultural Alliance, and Wynnefield Residents Association. Reynolds Brown is also an ex-officio member of the board of the Philadelphia Dance Company, and a general member of the Philadelphia Alumnae Chapter of the Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated.  I wish to thank Councilwoman Blondell Reynolds Brown for her long service to Philadelphia on its city council. I wish her success in all her future endeavors to serve the people of Pennsylvania."

Through his work and public service, Seth has helped improve his local communities and supported area youth. In addition to his service on the county commission, Seth has served as an assistant football coach for 8 years at Butte County High School. He has served as bishop and stake president in the Idaho Falls Temple Presidency. He has also been involved with the purchase and renovation of buildings that provide improved facilities for the county.

Senior Bishop McKinley Young was born on November 10, 1944, in Atlanta, GA; the eldest son of Reverend Lonnie C. Young and Mrs. Nellie Cummings Young. He attended Morris Brown College, where he earned his bachelor's degree and later received two master's degrees from Andover Newton Theological School and the University of Chicago Divinity School respectively.  Early in his ministry, Bishop Young pastored churches in the first, fourth, and sixth Episcopal Districts, including the historic Big Bethel A.M.E Church in Atlanta, GA. After being elected and consecrated the 109th Bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1992, his first episcopal assignment was to the 15th District of Angola, South Africa, and Namibia where he led the Centennial Celebration of African Methodism. Bishop Young would later serve as presiding prelate in Texas, Florida, and the Bahamas. His final episcopal assignment was with the third District, which includes Ohio, West Virginia, and Western Pennsylvania, where he served until his transition to the church triumphant on Wednesday, January 16, 2019.  Bishop Young's commitment to the church community was as strong as his commitment to voter education, voter registration, and getting people from the pews to the polls. This passion came from his lifelong belief that ``a vote-less people is a hopeless people.'' For decades, Bishop Young organized voter registration drives across the United States, empowering those who were historically voiceless in the voting process. His commitment to democratic values led him to South Africa, where he worked on voter registration efforts during the first free democratic election of the President of South Africa.  Throughout his journey and in addition to his ministerial and civic work, Bishop Young worked diligently to increase educational opportunities for African-American students, especially those attending historically black colleges and universities. He served on the board of trustees for Payne Theological Seminary, led the church in financially stabilizing Paul Quinn College, helped raise $2 million to secure Edward Walters College's accreditation, and would later serve as chancellor of Wilberforce University.  Bishop Young has served the ecumenical community faithfully for over 40 years. He was a devoted leader of the African Methodist Episcopal Church Service and Development Agency, Inc., SADA for over 20 years and served as chair of the board. Bishop Young's leadership among other faith councils only amplified the effectiveness of his advocacy across the faith community, including as a member of the Central Committee of the World Council of Churches, the National Council of Churches, the World Methodist Council, and the Conference of National Black Churches.  Bishop Young was a courageous servant leader, activist, and champion for civil and human rights whose service and dedication to countless communities will continue to inspire others for generations to come.  We wish every member of the African Methodist Episcopal Church that he served and those whose lives were touched by Bishop Young peace during this difficult time, especially his wife Dr. Dorothy Jackson Young, his children, Karyn, Deana, Andrea, and Stephanie, and eight grandchildren:"

Now a high school senior, Heather has worked with a number of organizations since her sophomore year to help prevent substance misuse among her peers and to fight for young people to have a seat at the table in efforts to combat this devastating epidemic.  Heather's advocacy on this issue began after a guidance counselor encouraged her to attend a weekend training with CADCA, Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America. At the end of the weekend, Heather participated on a panel of students proposing solutions to government officials and advocates on how to strengthen the response to this crisis that was broadcast live on New Hampshire's WMUR.  The CADCA training inspired Heather's continued activism, and in the years since, she has gotten involved in a variety of initiatives such as training younger students on over-the-counter medication safety, presenting on the importance of youth advocacy to DEA agents from across New England and the country, and participating in a public service announcement training with the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation. As a result of her work with the Mark Wahlberg foundation, Heather created several PSA's which were selected for further production and participated in an Emmy-winning PSA with WMUR. Heather also helped found Empower Youth 603--a youth coalition focused on substance misuse in New Hampshire--and she recently presented at CADCA's national conference in Washington, DC, where I met Heather and heard more about her work.  Heather says she is driven by the stories of her friends and peers, too many of whom have been impacted by New Hampshire's devastating opioid crisis. She believes that it is critical to stop substance misuse before it happens and that the best messenger for young people is often someone their own age.  For her continued efforts in preventing substance misuse, I am proud to recognize Heather McGlauflin as February's Granite Stater of the Month."

Rhode Island's earliest values are of inclusion, acceptance, and respect for difference. The founder of our State, Roger Williams, went off into an unknown wilderness and established a land in which tolerance and religious openness were the new standard. In keeping with these founding principles, the community of St. Michael's has been a place of welcome since its inception.  Generations of immigrants built this country; yet too often, those who come seeking the American dream are met with discrimination. Originally serving Irish and Western European immigrant populations often pushed to the margins of society, St. Michael's has expanded to incorporate the Providence of today, a multicultural, multilingual community.  Faith compels work toward fairness and justice for all living beings, regardless of nationality or social status. St. Michael's has fostered a vibrant community of people who are answering that call. The people of St. Michael's have partnered with nonprofit groups and other faith organizations to carry out meaningful advocacy work and provide direct services to those in need. It has been a privilege to know and work alongside church leaders like Sister Mary Reilly, Father Ray Malm, and the late Sister Ann Keefe. Their tireless advocacy and spirit of service have been manifested through the good works of numerous community organizations including Sophia Academy, Providence CityArts, AIDS Care Ocean State, and the Institute for the Study and Practice of Nonviolence. These groups have made rich and diverse contributions to the character of Rhode Island.  The immigrant spirit of perseverance is shared in the moral fiber of this country. In Rhode Island, St. Michael's church has been a symbol of refuge and hope for 160 years. They have made our State and the city of Providence better through their dedication to public life. I applaud the work of St. Michael's and its pastor, Father Robert Perron, and I congratulate the venerated parish on 160 years of service."

                "speech":"Madam President, I want to talk a little bit about John Dingell this evening, but before I do that, I just want to comment on the fact that we passed spending bills to fund our government for the balance of this fiscal year. That is a good thing--a good, good thing. I wish we had done it last year. In fact, we did--months ago. Democrats and Republicans joined together here almost unanimously to pass a spending plan for the balance of the fiscal year--all 13 appropriations bills, and they looked a whole lot like what we passed here today. Yet we went through a shutdown which created a lot of havoc and turmoil, not just for Federal employees but for the people whom they serve and we serve.  I have apologized for that, and I know other colleagues have as well. Hopefully, in the months ahead, we can make it up to the people who were inconvenienced. In many cases they were not just disadvantaged but treated very badly.  The President apparently is going to sign the spending bills we passed with broad bipartisan support, and I understand he is going to declare a state of emergency to be able to do additional things down at the border with Mexico.  Tomorrow morning at 6 a.m., I will lead a bipartisan delegation, with House and Senate Members, and we will not be going to the border. I have been there any number of times as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. We are not going to go to the border this time.  The President was down there a couple of weeks ago, and standing at the border he said: There is a human catastrophe or tragedy going on at the border.  I thought to myself: Well, what is going on at the border is very unfortunate, but the real human tragedy is what is going on in three countries: Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. The illegal immigration, to my surprise a couple of years ago, is not just coming from Mexico. In fact, today there are more Mexicans going back into Mexico from the United States than there are going the other way. I was surprised to learn that, but that is the case today.  Illegal immigration in our country is down about 80 percent from the year 2000, and the folks coming across the border illegally are coming from three countries--Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Each year in the last decade or so, they have vied for the title ``Murder Capital of the World.''  Their lives are made miserable because of our addiction to drugs. So having been complicit in their misery, the thought occurred to a number of us, including the last administration's President and Vice President and some of us in the House and the Senate, that maybe we should see why all of those people are coming out of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador and trying to come into the United States.  I will tell a true story. Some of them come to Delaware. We have three counties in my State. The southernmost county, Sussex County, is a big county that raises a lot of corn, soybeans, and raise a lot of chickens. We process a lot of chickens. Over the years, a lot of folks come up from Guatemala to work in the agriculture and poultry industry.  About 2 or 3 years ago, we had an increase--a blip in migration--especially from Guatemala. I was in Sussex County, in Georgetown, the county seat, right in the middle of all of this poultry business. There are three chickens for every person in Delaware, to give you some idea of the extent of it.  I met with the folks at La Esperanza. That is Spanish for hope. It is a non-profit. Their job is to try to help people who do make it across the border into our country and who have families, and they try to do some reconnection with their families.  But, anyway, I heard this story. There was a young man in Guatemala, a teenager, who was recruited by a gang there. He said he had to talk to his parents. He went to talk to his parents, and they said: We don't want you to join any gangs.  He went back, and the gang found him and approached him a couple of days later and said: Well, what do you think? Do you want to join our gang? He said: I talked to my parents, and they don't think it is the right thing for me to do now.  They said: Well, think about it some more.  A week or so later, they found him again and said: Well, what do you think? Are you ready to join our gang?  He said: No, I don't think I am going to do that now.  They said: If you don't join our gang, somebody in your family is going to die. Somebody in your family is going to die.  He went home, and he told his parents. They talked it over, and he joined the gang.  One of the things they do in these gangs--they have to go through an initiation. Part of his initiation was a requirement that he rape his 13-year-old sister. The son was like 15 years old, and one of the rites of passage is he had to rape his 13-year-old sister. He went home and told his parents what was expected of him. Within a week or two, the sister and the brother were on their way out of their country to try to be reunited with other relatives in the United States, and they ended up in Delaware. That is a human tragedy. I think if they had stayed there, it would have been probably an even greater human tragedy.  I am a big believer in root causes. Don't just address the symptoms of the problem. The symptom of the problem is people trying to get into our country and cross our borders illegally. That is a problem. That is a challenge. We need secure borders, but the root cause is what is going on in the countries that they are fleeing from--lack of rule of law, impunity, police who don't police, prosecutors who don't prosecute, judges who don't really administer the law, prisons that don't--correctional institutions that don't really correct behavior. Instead of turning out better people, they turn out better criminals. That has been a problem, and it has been a problem for some time.  Whenever we face a situation like this where an issue is really hard to deal with, what I like to say is, let's find out what works.  I am an old Governor. I used to be chairman of the National Governors Association. My last year as Governor, I chaired something in the NGA. In addition to being the Governor of Delaware, I chaired something called the Center for Best Practices. The idea was, how do we share solutions among Governors and among States for all the problems we face--some of the problems we face?  In trying to figure out how we help Guatemala and El Salvador sort of become less violent places, places with hope and opportunity--how can we help in that? So we looked around the world. We don't have to look too far, but if we look south of Central America, we find Colombia.  Colombia is a place where about 20 years ago, there were leftist guerillas trying to bring down the government, and there were drug lords trying to bring down the government. One day 20 years or so ago, a bunch of thugs rounded up the supreme court of the country--rounded them up, took them into a room, shot them all to death, killed them all.  Colombia was teetering, and it was not clear whether it was going to really make it as a nation. Some very brave people stood up and some of the leaders of Columbia stood up and said: We are not going to let these guys--whether it is the FARC, the leftist guerillas, or the drug lords--take over our country and take it down. We are going to fight back. The United States, led by then-President Bill Clinton and by a guy who was serving as the chairman, I think, of the Foreign Relations Committee, Joe Biden, sort of made common calls with the President of Colombia, who was a very brave person, and said to the Colombians: You can do this. Stabilize your country. Make it a more livable, decent place to live. We can help because we are complicit in their misery, too, given our addiction to drugs.  Well, guess what. They started something called Plan Colombia, and for 20 years it has worked slowly. Slowly. An example of what we did is we provided Apache helicopters. Why did we do that? So that the Colombian police and the Colombian military would have the mobility they need to go across the country and go after the bad guys and take them on. That was just one of the many things that was happening in Plan Colombia.  But again, it is like Home Depot. You have Home Depot, Madam President, in your State, and we have them in mine. What is their saying? ``You can do it, and we can help.'' So we said: Colombia, you can do it, and we can help. We are complicit in your misery, and we can help. And we have.  About a year or so ago, the President of Colombia won a Nobel Peace Prize. The leftist guerillas are--it is not perfect, but they are part of the government. Are drugs still a problem there? Yes, they are, but not like before. It is a country with a relatively bright future and one that we can be proud to call our friend and ally.  When we looked for a way to help in Central America--the Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador--we went to Colombia, and we said: Maybe it is possible to have a Central American version of Plan Colombia. And now we have that.  What we have done over the last 3, maybe 4 years, we funded those three countries in efforts to address some of the deficiencies that I just described--police who don't police, prosecutors who don't prosecute, judges who don't administer justice, and correctional institutions that don't really correct behavior. We have been doing this now for about 3 years, and our congressional delegation is going to go down there tomorrow and do a little bit of oversight and find out what is working in those three countries and what is not, whether they are meeting their responsibilities, and whether we are meeting our responsibilities.  You know, we can build a wall from sea to shining sea and from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. It can be 30 feet tall. But unless somehow the root causes of that migration--and it ain't coming from Mexico--some but not much. Again, more Mexicans are going back into Mexico than are coming the other way.  We really want to help the people of the Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador address those root causes. You know, they are going to keep coming up here, and if we lived there, we would want to come too.  You know, for what it is worth, we have had about 80 Presidential declarations of emergencies, I guess, in maybe the last century, and they were for Pearl Harbor, Katrina, 9/11, other disasters, some of them natural disasters, others. Since 2000, there has been an 80 percent reduction in illegal migration at the borders. Most of it is coming from these three countries, not Mexico. So we will see what happens with the declaration of emergency that the President is going to declare.  I think you have to be careful. To my Republican friends, I say this lovingly to you on Valentine's Day: The idea of a President invoking his powers, using his powers in this way, I am frankly not convinced that--while there certainly are challenges at the border, I have explained where I think the real challenges are, the real causes.  Someday, we will have a Democratic President, and he or she will be considering a range of options of what to do, and somebody is going to suggest: Well, in the earlier administration, the Trump administration, they declared it. So they will say: Well, I will just declare a national emergency and do what I want to do. That is a slippery slope, and I think that is one we need to be very careful about going on."

                "speech":"The last thing I would like to do, if I could, is I want to talk a little bit about John Dingell. I don't know if our Presiding Officer ever had a chance to meet him or know him. She says no--nods no.  I had the pleasure of knowing him I guess since 1982, 1983, when I was elected to the House. I was a Representative, and he was already there. I was the new guy, and I had been a treasurer of Delaware and a naval flight officer before that, and I finally retired from the Navy as a captain a few years ago.  He was so nice to me. He was a big guy, a giant of a man and kind of gruff. He was kind of gruff, and I can't imagine how the pages would have reacted to him if he yelled at them or frowned at them or growled at them. But for reasons that aren't all clear, he was really kind to me. I think in his heart that is what he was.  I like to work out. I like to run. I like to work out in gyms. They have a gym over at the House in the basement of the Rayburn Building. It is a pretty nice gym. We have one here. It is small by comparison. It is modest. I usually go home at night, but occasionally I would spend the night in DC when I was in the House, and the next morning I would go to the gym, and I would either go run out on the Mall, or I would lift weights or ride the bike or something in the gym. When I finished up, before I took a shower and got dressed, I would go in the steam room--the gym had a steam room in it--and a lot of times, John Dingell was in there.  I remember sitting there with him repeatedly over the years--not hundreds of times but many times. Sometimes there were several people there. We talked. Sometimes it was just the two of us. He gave me really good advice. He was like a mentor.  The day I was sworn in as a Congressman from Delaware, I was the dean of our delegation because we only had one, so I didn't really have like a big brother or a big sister in my delegation to look up to in the House. There was nobody else but me. I was brand new. John Dingell was nice, along with a bunch of other folks too. They kind of stepped up and gave me some of the guidance that I needed.  He was an interesting fellow because he chaired the Energy and Commerce Committee the whole time I was in the House and a long time after that, and he always looked out for his bread and butter. In Michigan, that is automobiles. This was a big deal. It was then, and it still is. So he always wanted to make sure that they had the predictability that they wanted and needed and that they could be successful. If I were the Senator or Representative from Michigan, I would want that too. But he also was really good on clean air issues, clean water issues, natural resource issues, open space issues, and agricultural issues.  I remember once on one of those mornings, we were talking about whether it is possible to be a good steward of the environment, mindful of air, water, open space, public health--is it possible to do all those things and also look out for job creation and job preservation, whether it is in Michigan or some other place?  My staff has heard me say this, I am tempted to say, a million times. Folks on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where I am a senior Democrat now, have heard me say this more often than they want to. I have always said it is possible to have clean air, clean water, better public health, do good things for our planet, and create jobs. They go hand-in-glove.  One of the first people who reminded me of that a long time ago was John Dingell. He supported the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. He supported the Clean Air Amendments in 1990, on which he was nice enough to let me offer a provision that was incorporated into the law. He did a lot to help preserve the auto industry not just in his State but in this country. He was an amazing guy.  Either the day he passed away or before he passed away, with his wife Debbie by his side--she is now a Congresswoman in his old seat--he shared with her some thoughts that he wanted to leave as part of his legacy at 92, and those words--I am not going to read them here today. I think they probably have already been read on the floor or introduced into the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that those words be printed in the Record. I will close with this. I went to the funeral. I couldn't stay the whole time. It was here in DC. I missed Steny Hoyer, the Democratic majority leader, and his comments. I was told he was terrific, as were others, as well. But I did get to hear just about everything Bill Clinton said. I was inspired and amused by that. He was funny. He really caught the character of John and his foibles, his strengths, and brilliance.  Before I went to the funeral, I went to a breakfast. A friend at the breakfast was kind enough to share his words with the rest of us. He actually worked for John Dingell at one time. In an off-the-cuff riff about John Dingell, he shared some of the things he worked on. Later on, I said: Would you share that with me? He was kind enough to do that.  I wish I could say these are my words, but that would be plagiarism. I give him the credit, at least in a left-handed sort of way. This is what my friend gave to me. I just want to close with these words from my friend about John Dingell:       This morning as I was reading the obituaries detailing      Congressman Dingell's life and accomplishments, I started      thinking of all the aspects of daily life that he had a      direct and meaningful impact on for almost 60 years.  He went on to say what some of them were.       The air we breathe, the water we drink. The health of      rivers and lakes. The wildlife that exists and depends upon      those spaces. The food we eat. The pills we take. The      products we use. The electricity that powers our economy. The      efficiency of almost every product that uses electricity. The      phones we use. The health insurance we count on in a medical      crisis. The regulation and cleanup of hazardous waste. The      cars we drive, of course! And a host of other things.  On this Valentine's Day--when we give thanks for our loved ones, our families, and those who are special in our lives--I also give thanks for John and the many blessings that he has left us and this country.  With that, I will say I appreciate the opportunity to share these words.  God bless.  Thank you."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, two names have been lost in months of government shutdowns and threats of national emergencies: Jakelin Caal Maquin and Felipe Gomez Alonzo. Those were the children who died in December while in the custody of our Federal Government.  Let me tell you a bit about Jakelin's story and how, in the next 48 hours, we will take a historic first step to forever change how our Nation treats children fleeing violence.  Jakelin Caal Maquin was 7 years old. She joined her father in fleeing the extreme danger and poverty of her village, San Antonio Secortez in Guatemala. Together, they dreamed of new opportunities, of new safety, of a home free from violence and discrimination where they could build a life and support their loved ones at home.  Jakelin and her father chose the same destination that asylum seekers, immigrants, and refugees have sought for centuries: the United States of America.  But the conditions I saw at the Border Patrol facilities where Jakelin and her father were held were not worthy of our American ideals. The conditions did not demonstrate respect for the human dignity of the individuals in our Federal Government's care.  Look, I am a doctor. I know what a functioning emergency medical response protocol looks like and how it should operate, and this was not it.  I saw women, infants, toddlers, and the elderly packed and even piled on top of each other, open toilets in crowded cells without any privacy, visibly sick people, children coughing on one another, and I immediately saw that the Border Patrol agents did not have the resources to respond to a life-threatening medical emergency.  Mr. Speaker, let me put this into perspective. I traveled to Haiti days after the devastating 2010 earthquake, where I served as the medical director of the country's largest camp of internally displaced people. The conditions I saw at the New Mexico Border Patrol facilities were worse than those I saw in Haiti, the most impoverished country in the Western Hemisphere, after their most challenging and devastating disaster.  Here we are, the greatest nation on our planet, and we are putting children in cages and denying them free access to food, water, and a private toilet.  Then and there, I committed myself to creating humanitarian standards that are worthy of human dignity: real solutions, not empty promises, that will save the lives of children at the border.  I introduced legislation that makes it clear Congress expects CBP to implement three crucial reforms as soon as possible:  First, provide meaningful medical examinations of individuals entering our borders. A basic physical exam would have shown warning signs of Jakelin's septic shock and most probably saved her life. A child who dies from septic shock does not look normal 8 hours beforehand.  Second, invest in essential medical equipment and trained medical personnel available to respond to life-threatening emergencies. When medical care is far away, agents need the resources, equipment, and knowledge to care for each other and the individuals in their custody.  Third, provide basic humane living conditions that are safe and hygienic, where individuals can access adequate food, water, and showers.  These are straightforward reforms. They move us closer to a system that is safe, humane, and aligns with our fundamental ideals as Americans.  Our work is not done, but we have reached an important milestone. We are beginning to address the humanitarian crisis at our border, not with rhetoric and political showboating or grandstanding, but with real, life-saving solutions.  This week, we will not just pass a bill that averts a government shutdown; we will pass a bill that provides funding for, and holds CBP accountable to, implementing the humanitarian standards included in my legislation, H. Con. Res. 17. These reforms will save lives and help restore our legacy as a nation that recognizes the dignity and fundamental rights of every human being. So, Mr. Speaker, I will speak the names of those two children again: Felipe Gomez Alonzo and Jakelin Caal Maquin. We must have the courage to recognize their humanity."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, this week I had the honor of meeting with the Pennsylvania National Guard Association, which is solely dedicated to more than 19,000 Guard members and more than 67,000 Guard veterans and their families.  The National Guard is an essential element of the United States military. Founded in 1636 as a citizen force organized to protect families and towns from hostile attacks, today's National Guard soldiers hold civilian jobs or attend college while maintaining their military training, always ready to defend the American way of life in the event of an emergency.  The mission of the Pennsylvania National Guard Association is to ensure the Pennsylvania National Guard is fully funded, manned, equipped, and trained to perform their Federal and State missions. That also includes ensuring that members and veterans have the benefits that they have earned.  Mr. Speaker, the Pennsylvania National Guard mostly hails from the Commonwealth, and they are prepared to serve the Nation at a moment's notice. In fact, Pennsylvania Guard personnel provided extraordinary support to areas affected by the disastrous 2018 hurricane season. They offered aviation support, restored lines of communication, and lent a helping hand to their fellow Americans in their time of need.  More than 1,000 Guard members assisted in domestic operations, including snowstorms and floods. In 2018, Guard members were deployed throughout the world in support of mobile operations. They also participated in training events at home and abroad to enhance readiness.  As part of its Federal mission, approximately 1,000 Pennsylvania National Guard personnel deployed throughout the world in 2018 in support of mobile operations, including Operation Spartan Shield, Operation Freedom Sentinel, and missions in support of U.S. Air Force's Central Command, Air Force Special Operations Command, and NATO.  Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to visit members of the Guard's 28th Infantry Division over the Thanksgiving holiday. I led a codel last November to Kuwait, where we met with members of the 28th Infantry Division who were deployed in support of Operation Spartan Shield.  The servicemembers that we visited, while serving honorably overseas, were also serving in one of the Army's most historic units. The 28th Infantry Division is the oldest continuous serving division in the United States Army. In 1918, it earned its nickname ``Iron Division,'' fighting during World War I, and 100 years later, the same division continues to defend freedom and liberty around the world.  Since the attacks of 9/11, more than 35,000 Pennsylvania National Guard members have deployed overseas. In fact, Pennsylvania's Fort Indiantown Gap is the busiest Army National Guard training center in the Nation.  The Pennsylvania National Guard is also home to the 56th Brigade Combat Team, which is one of the Army's nine Stryker Brigade Combat Teams. This is a team that my son Logan belonged to when he was in the National Guard before he went to Active Duty. It was the only National Guard Stryker brigade in the United States Army.  Mr. Speaker, the Pennsylvania National Guard continues to serve the Commonwealth and the Nation with pride and distinction. I look forward to its continued success. I thank all of our citizen soldiers, past and present, for their service."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, recently I spent the day in the Mount Washington Valley, with local businesses, hearing from small business owners about the challenges that they face.  I met with the owners of White Mountain Puzzles, a second-generation family business that produces 1.6 million made-in-the-U.S. puzzles a year and sells them all over the world.  Later in the day, I stopped by Lupine Pet, another terrific locally owned business that sells durable pet collars and harnesses.  Mr. Speaker, in keeping with our proud Live Free or Die tradition in the Granite State, we pay no sales taxes on goods and services.  White Mountain Puzzles and Lupine Pet are just two of the many small businesses that have thrived under the rules of the road of our State's economy. Unfortunately, a recent Supreme Court decision is casting a dark shadow over these entrepreneurs. It is threatening those who have brick-and-mortar operations in our State and make a living from online sales to customers across the street and around the world.  Mr. Speaker, in June of 2018, the Supreme Court upended decades of precedent. In its decision in the Wayfair case, the Court ruled that a jurisdiction may legally impose sales taxes on customers of sellers that don't have a physical presence within that jurisdiction's borders.  Unfortunately, States across the country are now rushing to capitalize on this new taxing power, to the detriment of businesses in New Hampshire that don't impose sales taxes on consumers and aren't prepared to collect them.  Ultimately, the Wayfair decision could force untold numbers of small retailers in my State to stop doing business altogether over the internet. That is a possibility that should alarm every American.  We should be empowering entrepreneurs and innovators, the true driving force of the American economy, not stifling them with burdensome tax collection requirements.  Here is the bottom line, Mr. Speaker: Businesses in my district should not be punished simply for using the internet to reach their customer base.  Clearly, the time has come for Congress to act, and there are commonsense steps that Members of both parties should embrace, regardless of the tax laws in the States that we represent.  First and foremost, we should prevent sales taxes from being imposed retroactively, and we should give businesses enough time to understand this Court decision. As a business owner myself, I can tell you how unreasonable it is to expect companies to somehow meet this new tax collection obligation at the drop of a hat, a financial burden that they couldn't possibly have anticipated.  Second, given the high cost and complexity of complying with different sales tax laws in nearly 11,000 jurisdictions, we should create an exception to collection requirements for these small businesses.  The great folks at White Mountain Puzzles have a special talent for creating incredible jigsaw puzzles, not for navigating complex unique sales tax rules from every State and municipality in America.  Dave and Scott at Lupine Pet don't have a legal department or a big team of accountants to assist them in collecting and remitting the right amounts. And they say the cost of compliance, including the software solution for their small business, adds up to at least $25,000 a year.  Let's give them and millions of other small business owners a well-deserved break. Let's give them the protections that they deserve.  Mr. Speaker, e-commerce is an American success story. Online sales have created millions of jobs and connect Americans from coast to coast.  Internet retailers give rural America the opportunity to participate more fully in our country's economic success. Let's give these online sellers, including hundreds of small businesses in the Granite State, the support and certainty they deserve to continue to grow and prosper."

From Monahans to Alpine, Fort Davis to Eagle Pass, my team crisscrossed the 29 counties I represent and heard from 23 of our Nation's heroes whose stories will be preserved for generations to come through the Library of Congress' Veterans History Project.  From those who just finished serving in the military to veterans of the Vietnam war and Second World War, these men stood in the trenches overseas, flew aircraft over Nazi Germany, and put themselves in harm's way to protect our Nation from threats across the globe--from the Axis Powers to ISIS. They paved the way for today's servicemembers who keep us safe every single day.  I thank the Library of Congress for preserving these stories so that we can learn about our past and teach future generations the value of selfless service.  I thank all who have served, and God bless these United States of America. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the outstanding achievement of the San Antonio Christian School swim teams for winning both the girls and boys Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools Division 2 State Championships last week.  This achievement is truly a testament to their dedicated work ethic and incredible talents. What a fantastic way to end an undefeated season. Hard work and practice paid off. Their parents, peers, and community are proud of them.  Included in this group is a former intern of mine, a gifted athlete and rising star--Michael O'Brien of San Antonio, Texas. Well done, Michael.  Enjoy these great moments. You will treasure them for the rest of your lives. Go Lions. Mr. Speaker, in 2019, there are more women serving in Congress than at any other point in American history. This is a tremendous achievement for our Nation and a trend I hope will continue, because while women are half the population, they still make up less than one-quarter of my congressional colleagues.  I rise today to recognize an organization that is doing crucial work to bridge this gap. Since its inception in 2007, Running Start has trained over 10,000 young women to run for office. I am proud to be a congressional co-chair of Running Start because our elected leaders must better reflect the makeup of our country.  With all the problems we face as a nation, the only way we are going to solve them is by working together, and that will require including more women in the conversation. Running Start is training the next generation of women leaders who do just that.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the incredible young women in Running Start's network and encourage the young women in their lives and our lives to never let anyone ever tell them they are not capable of running for office."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, the very survival of humankind is in peril, and there is no greater threat to our continued existence than climate change. From the inaction of this administration, you would never guess the seriousness of the risk confronting us. For the sake of our very survival, I urge my colleagues to put aside their concerns about how our party leaders or how our base will judge us.  All that truly matters is how our grandchildren will judge us. There are those who claim they don't believe in climate change. Those doubters deserve no more of our time or attention than those who don't believe in gravity. Science doesn't care. There are those who claim we can't make progress until we have a new occupant of the White House and a Democratic majority in the Senate. To those I say, We have no time to wait. Two years of inaction is 2 years we can never get back.  We in this body need to begin tackling climate change now, and we need to start by talking about it differently, not as an unproven scientific theory, not as a political inconvenience and not as a job killer. It is an economic opportunity. Action on climate change can be the path to making the U.S. more globally competitive.  I don't speak on this floor today as a theorist. From 2000 to 2016, I built multiple companies with missions to profitably reduce greenhouse gas emissions. My colleagues and I made U.S. manufacturers more competitive by reducing their energy expenses. We built more than 80 projects and $300 million of capital investment, and I can now say three things with certainty: One, there are no thermodynamic barriers to drastically lowering CO2 emissions; and two, there are no economic barriers to businesses pursuing profits. That leads me to three, that there are a lot of legal barriers to profitably reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This gives us an opportunity, because while we can't change the laws of thermodynamics, and we can't change the laws of economics, we can change the laws of the United States. We don't need to reinvent the wheel. Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark all use half as much energy as we do per dollar of GDP. Those countries have the same access to talent, the same access to capital and technology as we do, but they use half as much energy. If all we did was copy them, we could cut CO2 emissions by 50 percent.  I think we could do better. Consider this: in 2007, over a decade ago, Congress tried and failed to pass the Lieberman-Warner climate bill which was seen by some as being too ambitious because it sought to cut U.S. electric sector emissions by 17 percent. It didn't pass, and there was a powerful Senator who said at the time that the bill would drastically increase energy costs and cost millions of American jobs, all for no environmental gain.  As Warner Wolf says, ``Let's go to the videotape.'' CO2 emissions since then in the electric sector are down by nearly 25 percent per megawatt hour and real power prices are down by 4 percent over the last decade. Just imagine what we could have done if we tried.  So why did emissions fall? Because of economics.  We have gradually been building more efficient, cleaner, and cheaper power plants, and once those plants are built, they always run more than the older, less efficient plants, because here is the little secret: businesses like to make money, and you make more money if you spend less on fuel.  Mr. Speaker, if my colleagues take nothing else away from this speech, I hope they will understand that point. Everything we do to make our economy less dependent on expensive fossil fuel lowers CO2 emissions and makes our businesses more profitable. That protects American jobs and makes our citizens wealthier.  So let me take this opportunity to speak to those who don't believe the science and to those who believe the science but think a warmer world is a good thing: Keep your beliefs. Hold on to them. All I am asking is that you be greedy. Greedy for America, as our President has boasted. Because if you are greedy, you will work with me to see CO2 reduction as an opportunity for cost reduction and profit maximization.  I mentioned at the start of my remarks that the primary barrier to meaningful CO2 reductions are U.S. laws. That is not to say that those laws have been written with bad intent. To the contrary, many of those well-intentioned laws have had unintentional, negative consequences. Well-intentioned aspects of our Tax Code often cause capital to flow to the least economic technologies. Well-intentioned portions of the Clean Air Act discourage energy efficiency. Well-intentioned social policies obscure the true cost of fossil fuels, distorting capital markets away from cheaper alternatives.  But that is great news because we can fix all of those things. So let's make U.S. manufacturers more competitive. Let's help them cut energy costs. Let's protect U.S. jobs. Let's make our energy system more resilient. And let's lower CO2 emissions.  I think that is pretty bipartisan. And as I go to work on the Select Committee on Climate Crisis, I will be working toward writing and introducing legislation, and I look forward to hearing all the great ideas from my colleagues in this body. I don't claim to have all the answers, but I know that we do. But for goodness' sake, let's not wait."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Judge William Mark Ashford of the Fourth Judicial District Court of Nebraska who was known for his jovial smile, gregarious nature, and being a fearless voice for justice. February 14th marks what would have been his 67th birthday. His untimely passing is a great loss for his family, friends, and for the people of our community whom he served with the highest level of commitment, integrity, and honor.  Appointed to the bench in 1988, Judge Ashford's work ethic and uncompromising professional integrity quickly garnered the respect of most and ruffled the feathers of some. Armed with a sharp legal mind and even sharper focus on the public he served, Judge Ashford was a stalwart judicial advocate, fighting for transparency in and out of the courtroom.  His eternal faith in humanity and in the power of justice will continue to serve as an unyielding example. Nebraska Supreme Court Chief Justice Mike Heavican noted that Judge Ashford's work with the young adult treatment court and his pioneering efforts to establish the Douglas County Veterans Treatment Court would be sorely missed.  Veterans treatment courts are tapping into the unique aspects of military and veteran culture and using them to the benefit of the veteran. According to the Omaha World Herald: ``Ashford felt a calling to oversee veterans court because his father was a World War II pilot who once flew a fighter plane called the Aksarben Knight.''  I extend my deepest condolences to his friends and family members, especially his wife, Deb Ashford; sons, Steven and Sam Ashford; stepsons, Keith, Kristopher and Kent; and brothers, Brad and Carl Ashford. Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the occasion of African American History Month to recognize two key figures in Nebraska history, Will Brown and George Smith, both murdered by lynching at the hands of lawless mobs. This is not a past Nebraskans are proud of, but it is a story we must continue to tell so we never forget them or allow acts of hate like these to ever be repeated.  Nearly 100 years ago in the summer of 1919, Black people were killed amid violent race riots occurring across the country. Omaha, Nebraska, was not immune during that Red Summer and regrettably became known for one of the most heinous acts of hate and racial violence in American history.  According to research, the destructive flames of hatred and racism at the time were fanned by a series of politically motivated articles published in newspapers like the Omaha Bee. Alarmed at the Bee's promotion of racial prejudice, Reverend John Albert Williams, first president of the local chapter of the NAACP and minister of St. Philip's Episcopal Church called upon the editors of the Bee to stop their propaganda.  On September 28, 1919, a raucous crowd of more than 4,000, emboldened by the destructive rhetoric, grew violent and set fire to the Douglas County Courthouse. When Omaha Mayor Edward Smith tried to calm the crowd, he was assaulted and nearly killed by the mob before being rescued by local law enforcement. Without a trial, the riotous horde seized Mr. Brown, who had been accused of rape and robbery. Despite his exclamations of innocence, and physical evidence supporting his claims, Mr. Brown was brutally murdered. His body was paraded through the streets as a form of racial terrorism.  Equally disturbing was the lynching of George Smith, also known as Joe Coe, 28 years earlier in October of 1891. Mr. Smith was falsely accused of raping a young girl, despite having a valid alibi and witnesses who attested to his innocence. Again, unchecked hatred fueled the unjustified lynching without any judicial process.  By shining light on these horrid shadows of injustice in America, we can begin to speak truthfully about this difficult history so that reconciliation can be achieved. It also allows us to honor the inspirational leaders who rise up to promote equality and eradicate racial subjugation. The work of the NAACP was tremendously effective in awakening the Nation to the urgency of stopping lynching.  Today in my community a coalition has been formed called the Omaha Community Council for Racial Justice and Reconciliation, to coordinate efforts to memorialize victims of lynching and raise awareness of racial violence in Douglas County.  I call on all who hear these words to stand against hate, racism, and injustice whenever and wherever it may be found. We must ensure acts like these are never allowed to occur again and that the lessons of Will Brown and George Smith's deaths are never forgotten. We are a nation that respects life, liberty, equality, and the rule of law."

Res. 37 and to stand in opposition to continued U.S. engagement in hostilities in Yemen as yet undeclared by Congress. However, this is just the first step in addressing just how far astray we have gone when it comes to Yemen and in our foreign policy more broadly.  Let's be clear: the crisis unfolding in Yemen right now is a consequence and the responsibility of actions by both Republican and Democratic administrations. We took a low level conflict, and we put it on steroids. We took a regional issue, and we turned it into the biggest humanitarian crisis in the world.  For what?  We started supporting the anti-Houthi coalition because we didn't want Iran to expand its influence, and here we are, the Houthis are closer than ever to Tehran, and they are launching Iranian-made missiles at Riyadh.  I thought we were done doing dumb stuff.  On top of all of this, the President compounded this humanitarian crisis by implementing a travel ban which left the families of American citizens stranded in a war zone that we ourselves helped create.  Now, I represent one of the largest Yemeni-American communities in the United States. I have hundreds of families in my district, Staten Island and south Brooklyn, who worry about their husbands, their wives, their children, and their parents, who only want to be reunited with them in the United States.  Now, many families have told me that they can apply for a waiver which somehow makes this constitutional. But not a single person from the Secretary of State on down can tell me how my constituents can actually get the waivers that their family members so desperately need. We still don't know.  Nobody cares about national security more than I do, but this isn't it. We are the most powerful country in the world, and we have trapped my constituents' loved ones in a war zone with no answers for how they can get out of there.  How does this make us more safe?  It is time we have a clear-eyed look at how we conduct our foreign policy and, more importantly, how we decide to use military force in the first place. This resolution is just one step in the right direction."

He began his long and distinguished career by serving as a JAG officer in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam war, serving in Germany, Vietnam, and Korea.  He returned home to serve later as the city attorney, then the public defender, then the prosecutor, followed by circuit court judge, all before being elected to Kentucky's highest court, the Kentucky Supreme Court, where he has been a justice for the last 12 years.  His skills in the courtroom were not just limited to the courtroom. Growing up the youngest of five unruly boys, we found that he brought those skills home with him.  I recall one time when three of my older brothers came home late, past curfew, with the smell of alcohol. Their stories did not jibe with one another, so he immediately sequestered each brother in three separate rooms and went from room to room interrogating each of them, only to find out their story of a flat tire fell apart very quickly when they could not decide on which tire was flat and who fixed it.  He acted as the judge, the jury, and the executioner of our household in disciplining five boys.  I recall one time being disciplined at school for fighting. I came home. My father told me: If you are in trouble at school, you are in trouble at home.  He took a 25-pound weight, put it in a backpack, and made me carry that backpack around with me everywhere I went--to school, back from school to home--with the message that, if I was going to be a weight on him, he was going to put a weight on me. No doubt, such behavior would probably call attention to child services these days.  He is the bastion of public service; he is the example of integrity; and, last but not least, he is my hero.  Thank you, Dad, for all of your hard work, for leading by example.  He treated every single person with dignity and with respect. Even today, when he goes inside the walls of Kentucky's State Penitentiary, the maximum security penitentiary, he walks around in the yard and people approach him--people he has prosecuted, people he has sentenced to the penitentiary--and they come up and want to shake his hand because he treated every single person with dignity and with respect.  I want to thank my father, Justice Bill Cunningham, for making this world a better one.  And to my mother, who will be the beneficiary to all of his newfound free time, I wish to say to her: Good luck."

Held at the Newtown Township Building, first responders in attendance received letters of appreciation and cookies for their service and their sacrifice. Students also sang a song of gratitude to the heroes in our community.

In her years of service, Judge Boylan has worked in the public defender's office, the office of the district attorney, and also was Bucks County controller before her judgeship.  Throughout Judge Boylan's tenure, she has been known as a fair judge who is not afraid to hold people accountable and always seeks to rehabilitate those in need.  Notably, her work with juveniles and those struggling with addiction truly embodies her dedication to both justice and fairness.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2018, more than 2,000 illegal aliens were apprehended by Federal agents for homicides committed on American soil. In addition, over 70,000 Americans are killed each year by poisonous drugs, much of which is shipped illegally into America across our porous southern border by illegal aliens, MS-13, and other drug cartels.  Stronger border security, which must include wall construction, will save thousands of American lives each year.  Unfortunately, in the worst betrayal of America in history, socialist Democrats, motivated by a lust for political power, selfishly elevate illegal aliens over American citizens because illegal alien families overwhelmingly rely on welfare, thus making them highly reliable Democrat voters who elect socialist Democrat politicians by diluting the votes of American citizens.  Inasmuch as socialist Democrats refuse to protect American lives from illegal alien homicides, drug deaths, and America's porous southern border, I urge President Trump to secure our borders and build the wall under existing law and Presidential powers.  For example, title 10, section 284 of the United States Code empowers Presidents to order America's military to assist Federal drug and law enforcement agencies in the fight against drug and transnational organized crime.  Pursuant to this law, the President may deploy active military and National Guard troops to establish and operate bases of operations; detect and monitor surface traffic in Mexico and in the United States within 25 miles of the southern border; construct roads, fences, barriers, and lighting to block drug smuggling corridors across the southern border; and use aerial and ground reconnaissance.  For emphasis, this Federal law empowers President Trump to order America's military to construct walls and barriers to block drug smuggling corridors, with the side benefit of stopping illegal aliens.  Mr. Speaker, another example of existing Presidential authority is the power to declare a national emergency and divert congressionally appropriated money to border security and wall construction.  America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan based on 9/11 terrorist attacks that killed roughly 3,000 people. In response, America spent trillions of dollars and lost thousands of lives in military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.  While 9/11 was horrific, 9/11 deaths pale in comparison to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are dead or will die over the years because of illegal alien homicides and overdoses caused by deadly drugs shipped across America's porous southern border.  For emphasis, a minimum of 50 Americans die each day we delay securing our southern border. That is a minimum of 15,000 dead Americans each year. This death rate easily justifies a Presidential declaration of a national emergency. In fact, not one of the 58 national emergencies declared by a President since 1979 is supported by a worse death rate or threat to America and American lives.  Mr. Speaker, an extraordinarily weak and conflicted Congress is of no help. Worse yet, this Congress is a hindrance. As such, I urge President Trump, as America's Commander in Chief, to invoke title 10 United States Code section 284, declare a national emergency, and use every other authority, statutorily and constitutionally, he possesses to direct the military to secure our southern border, build the wall, and protect and save American lives.  America's military protects the borders and lives in South Korea, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Europe, and many other countries. America and Americans deserve no less protection."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I ask one question today: What happened to the Democrat party?  Democrats, up until just recently, were a lot closer to the middle. Take John F. Kennedy, for example, who argued in favor of supply-side economics and fought for tax cuts and personal responsibility.  Bill Clinton and Dianne Feinstein are recorded decrying rampant illegal immigration. Bill Clinton described Democrat policies on abortion as safe, legal, and rare. Even as recent as last decade, Barack Obama attacked companies for hiring illegal aliens.  But something new is emerging from their ranks. Dangerous extremist ideas are becoming the new normal on the left side of the aisle.  Let's begin with infanticide. Are Democrats truly accepting killing babies outside the womb now?  A Democrat head of State, last month, casually defended it on a radio station broadcasting in the Nation's Capital. He explained to listeners that an infant already delivered would be kept comfortable while a mother and a doctor discussed letting the child die. When pressed for clarification, he explained that the scenario he envisioned involved a baby with deformities. Assuming he meant something like Down syndrome or something similar, this is an outrageous claim. If you go and ask people with Down syndrome, they think their life is worth living, and I couldn't agree more.  If all of that is not sitting well with you right now, well, we are just getting started, or I should say, they are just getting started.  How about the newly unveiled Green New Deal? This massive overhaul of the entire U.S. economy was reportedly drafted over a single weekend by a bunch of staffers and environmental activists. The visionaries behind this massive bill are hoping to eliminate air travel, gut and rebuild every building in America, eliminate 99 percent of cars, eliminate nuclear energy, and ban affordable energies like natural gas.  One of the authors of the Green New Deal laments that we aren't sure we will be able to fully get rid of flatulating cows fast enough to get down to zero carbon emissions. Of course, that has been pulled off their website, following the appropriate national response.  But don't worry, the authors tell us, if passed into law, the government will guarantee each and every one of us a high-paying job, free education for life, a house, free money, and healthy food for all Americans.  How about the various proposals to get free healthcare for everyone? The most popular one of these, Medicare for All, was introduced by a self-described socialist and has received enthusiastic endorsement of 2020 Democratic Presidential candidates. Cautious estimates of the cost of Sanders' plan start at around $32.6 trillion over the next 10 years.  Even if we implement the most aggressive tax plan to seize and redistribute wealth, the hard-earned work of some Americans, we only raise $720 billion over 10 years, or 2 percent of what Medicare for All will cost.  Keep in mind, our revenue for the entire United States over that same period will only be approximately $40 trillion, unless, of course, this bill passed and we tailspin toward a second Great Depression.  Democrats have abandoned all reason in the immigration debate as well. We are witnessing Democrat officials offering homes, voting rights, welfare, and taxpayer-funded education to anyone and everyone who is able to sneak into the interior of the United States. It has been estimated that each illegal border-crosser is a net fiscal burden of $74,722 to the United States, and that is before all the goodies I mentioned previously are added.  Moreover, we have one primary agency in charge of identifying and apprehending illegal aliens who go on to commit other crimes, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Democratic officials are demanding we eliminate them. Instead, they tell us to give everyone amnesty, something estimated to cost taxpayers another $2 trillion.  With all the free programs available to illegal aliens in the United States, it is no wonder they are flooding over the southern border. According to the White House, 400,000 migrants were apprehended attempting to illegally enter the United States in FY18 alone.  Along the way, reports from nonpartisan organizations state that one in three women are sexually assaulted on the trip north. They also have to pass through something called the route of death. Do we really want to incentivize people to make this trek? A wall and a crackdown on illegal immigration would surely disincentivize migrants and save lives."

I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Dunlap at a charity event in my district, where he and his wife of 50 years, Judy, were providing scholarships for local schoolchildren. A self-described ``nothing kid from the slums of Hoboken, New Jersey,'' he was a tough guy, a shrewd businessman known around the world, but a man with a big heart.  Mr. Dunlap earned a degree in engineering at the United States Military Academy, West Point, and served our Nation in the U.S. Army. He went on to lead many successful businesses around the world and had dined with kings and queens and just wealthy people around the world.  He moved his work down to the Ocala, Florida, area, where I live. But it is not his work in the business world that he will be most remembered for. Mr. Dunlap was an important part of his community and was always there to lend a helping hand to his friends, his neighbors, and his community.  He supported my rival university in our State, Florida State University, to the tune of over $40 million, and we always had fun ribbing each other about the Gators and the Seminoles.  During his lifetime, the kindness and selflessness of Mr. Dunlap and his wife, Judy, touched many lives, and he will be greatly missed. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a man who was a pillar in our community and in the agricultural community, Mr. Murrel Hines. I have known Mr. Hines, Murrel, for more than 35 years. In fact, I knew him before I became a veterinarian and was able to work on their family farm.  He and the rest of the Hines family had a profound impact on my professional career as a large animal veterinarian but also as a person. The Hines family farm is a generational farm that goes back to the 1850s. Today, the Hines family is the cornerstone of the Gilchrest community.  When you look at farm families in America, they are the salt of the Earth. Mr. Hines and his family were those people. They were the salt of the Earth. They would do anything for you at anytime, anywhere, any day, and ask nothing from you in return.  Some of my earliest memories as a young veterinarian, not even out of vet school yet, included working with the Hines family on their farm. I can recall working cows in their pens in the morning and joining the family for lunch, where there was no shortage of homemade biscuits by his wife, Ms. Betty Jo. Jokes and stories ran wild, and we always had a great time. He was the pillar of the family, the patriarch.  One thing about Mr. Murrel, there was never a shortage of work ethic in the man. I saw him working cattle up into his 80s every day, from morning until night. In fact, he said he had retired, but he would show up at 7:30 and work until 9 at night.  Despite quitting school at the age of 13, Mr. Murrel had more common sense and business acumen than most who go all the way through college. He successfully grew watermelons, tobacco, peanuts, hay, grass, and cattle. He also grew his father's cattle operation beyond what others said could be done.  Mr. Murrel knew, according to the Scriptures in the Psalms, that the Lord had no need for a bull or a goat, for every beast of the forest was His, as were all the cattle on a thousand hills. Murrel himself sure knew what it was like to have that many cows. But seriously, he was a proud caretaker of the Lord's land and a man of conviction and faith.  Just last year, he was presented the Conservation Stewardship Award for his work in best farming practices. To him, recognition and awards weren't necessary. He just always did what was right.  He was, in every sense of the word, a true cowboy. A vise-like grip, an easy smile, a man of great faith but of few words, he was a family man. Married to his wife, Betty Jo, for over 70 years, he was an example to us all when it came to family, work, common sense, giving back, and, ultimately, life.  It is my honor to have known him and worked beside him and to have shared so many memories with him and the rest of the Hines family over the years.  Mr. Speaker, in honor of my friend and mentor, Mr. Murrel Hines, I would like to close with ``The Cowboy's Prayer.''  ``Heavenly Father, I pause, mindful of the many blessings You have bestowed upon me. I ask that You will guide me in my life. Help me, Lord, to live my life in such a manner that when I make that last ride to the country up there, where the grass grows lush and the water runs cool, that You will take me by the hand and say, `Welcome home, cowboy.'

Motivated by his drive to fix the injustices that the LGBTQ community faced back in the late eighties, Greg took action and entered public life during a time when acceptance and understanding was not the norm. He inspired many, including me, by taking a courageous stance and living life as his true self, becoming Riverside County's first openly gay elected official. It was Greg's persistence that encouraged me to continue pursuing my passion to serve my community, regardless of the setbacks I faced as an openly gay person.  Though he was initially motivated by his passion to improve the lives of LGBTQ people, his lifetime of service brought justice to all people. As mayor of Cathedral City, Greg helped improve transportation infrastructure in his region and recognized LGBTQ veterans in his city by erecting a monument in their honor. If his memorial service was any indication, Mayor Pettis' legacy will live on for years to come."

This bill would allow for whole milk, both flavored and non-flavored, to be offered in our school cafeterias.  Mr. Speaker, milk was once a staple in the diet of our students, but consumption in schools has dramatically decreased since the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 was implemented and basically demonized milk fat that we know today, based on science, is where all the nutrition, let alone the flavor, is.  Milk is the number one source of nine essential nutrients in the diet of many young Americans. We can provide the foundation for a solid, healthy lunch in our schools that also tastes great and that children will want to drink and is good for them. When students don't consume milk, they are not getting nutrients, such as calcium, potassium, and vitamin D. This bill offers more varieties to give kids the option of consuming the milk they love.  I encourage my colleagues to support the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act and put flavor back into school lunches."

I am a proud cosponsor of Congresswoman Ann Wagner's bill to define any infant who survives an abortion as a legal person and ensure the baby receives the same medical care that any newborn receives.  This is in stark contrast to the legislation just passed in the State of New York and the proposal in the State of Virginia which legalizes late-term abortion even up until birth. These radical attempts demonstrate that this is a human rights issue that we must address.  Protecting the dignity of human life upholds our society's highest values, and denying lifesaving medical care for newborn babies should defy our Nation's collective conscience."

This put our country in jeopardy by withholding paychecks for 800,000 Federal employees who are patriots and provide critical services to our country and to all Americans.  Put simply, this was not an issue worth shutting down the Federal Government. That is why I am pleased we are here today to avoid another shutdown and begin to get the agencies affected by the shutdown back on track.  This bill provides appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills through the end of the fiscal year, including Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration; Commerce, Justice, Science; Financial Services and General Government; Homeland Security; Interior and Environment; State and Foreign Operations; and Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.  Over the past 6 weeks, we heard testimony from the chairs and ranking members of the Appropriations Committee numerous times as we tried to reopen the government last month.  A constant theme from those hearings, from both Democrats and Republicans, was respect for the appropriators and their ability to negotiate a deal. Today's result is confirmation of that trust we placed in our appropriators.  I want to congratulate all the committee Members and staff for their work over the last few weeks.  The conference report in front of us today is by no means perfect, but it represents a compromise between Democrats and Republicans and between the House and the Senate.  There are many programs well funded by this bill. For instance, the Census Bureau will see an increase of more than $1 billion as they prepare for the 2020 Census, to ensure an accurate count.  NASA, which invests heavily in Colorado and across all of the country, will see a $763 million increase over last year to fully fund NASA's science mission directorates and support human exploration, from the international space station, to the Moon, and on to Mars by 2033.  This legislation provides $17 billion in funding for new infrastructure investments in roads, bridges, transit, and housing, and the bill blocks attempts by the White House to hamstring the EPA and other agencies from protecting our environment.  Importantly, the bill overrides the President's decision to freeze Federal employee pay this year. Instead, it provides a 1.9 percent pay raise for all Federal employees.  This conference agreement also makes smart investments in border security by investing $755 million in infrastructure and technology at ports of entry, additional funds to hire customs agents, $563 million for immigration judges to reduce the backlog, and humanitarian aid for Central American countries and along our border to those who need the help.  The bill also provides $1.375 billion for border fencing, with restrictions protecting sensitive areas and local involvement, and takes steps to reduce the immigration detention bed levels, for which I am confident the House will provide rigorous oversight.  Madam Speaker, there are a few things missing from this agreement to help us repair the damage from the longest partial government shutdown in United States history.  First, the bill does not provide Federal contractors backpay from the shutdown. Federal contractors often work side by side with other Federal employees and perform jobs important to the country and all Americans. These contractors did nothing wrong and deserve to be made whole, just like the 800,000 Federal employees who missed paychecks. Congress needs to work together and make this right.  Additionally, during this shutdown, my State of Colorado, along with California, Louisiana, Vermont, and Washington, took steps to ensure fairness for excepted Federal employees to make them eligible for unemployment insurance because they were forced to continue working without knowing when they would be paid.  Unemployment benefits are a lifeline for situations just like this where there is nowhere else to go, but, unfortunately, the United States Department of Labor choose to make it more difficult for States to provide these benefits. The Department has said it will not reimburse States for these legitimate costs and has threatened additional penalties, putting earned benefits for other unemployed workers at risk.  I am a cosponsor of legislation produced by Representative Katie Hill from California which would clarify current law and ensure our States are reimbursed as intended by Congress. For reasons I don't quite understand, my friends on the other side of the aisle would not accept this provision. I plan to continue working with Representative Katie Hill and Chairman Richie Neal from the Ways and Means Committee to help States like Colorado.  Additionally, I worked to introduce two pieces of legislation during the shutdown to help Federal employees deal with the effects of the shutdown. First was H.R. 545, the Financial Relief for Feds Act, which was introduced by Representative Pete Olson from Texas and Representative   Don Beyer from Virginia and me, and this was to ensure Federal employees who made withdrawals during a shutdown from their Thrift Savings Plan or other retirement accounts weren't penalized for their early withdrawals.  TSP saw a 35 percent increase in hardship withdrawals during the shutdown as Federal employees did anything they could to help pay their bills. I hope our legislation is considered by the House quickly to make these Federal employees whole again.  I also introduced H.R. 781, The Student Loan Relief for Feds Act, with Representative Will Hurd from Texas to allow Federal employees to defer their student loans without penalty during a government shutdown. A typical student loan payment is between $200 and $300 a month, and that is money you don't have if you are not getting a paycheck.  These are examples of legislation we need to pass to fix problems created during the shutdown.  There is one more bill I will be introducing today--I just put it in the hopper--to prevent these shutdowns from ever happening again.  If Congress and the White House have a political disagreement, our Federal employees and the American people shouldn't be the pawns who suffer the consequences of the disagreement. My bill, the No More Shutdowns Act, provides automatic continuing appropriations for any fiscal year when appropriations haven't been enacted.  This means whenever there would be a lapse in the appropriations, funding would continue at previously enacted levels, along with an increase to the account for inflation until Congress passes an appropriation bill. This is common sense and would allow our Federal agencies to continue their work without the start and stop of shutdowns and short-term CRs.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in making sure shutdowns do not happen again.  Overall, Madam Speaker, this is a good compromise to fully fund these agencies so we can finish last year's work and allow Congress to move on to other important issues that we were sent here to do, like reducing healthcare costs and repairing infrastructure across the country.  I urge all my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying conference agreement, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank my good friend from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for yielding, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, we are here today to pass an appropriations package that should complete our work and fully fund the government for fiscal year 2019.  As Members of this body know, this has been a long road, perhaps much longer than we expected at the beginning.  As we saw at the start of this Congress, the difficulties this body can sometimes face in coming to an agreement can translate into difficulty and hardship for the American people. I think I can speak for all of us here in this body when I say that government shutdowns are bad for the American people, bad for government, and bad policy, and we should all strive to never let them happen again.  Now, of course, we have a little bit different view of how that shutdown came about. It is worth noting for the record that the House actually did vote to fund the government and produced a bill in December that the President said he would sign and a majority of the United States Senate actually favored.  But the Senate gets to set its own rules. They could reach a number of 60, but the Democratic minority chose not to do that. So, given that, that is what shut down the government, and we have all been dealing with the consequences of it ever since.  But today we are poised to finish our work, and though the road may have been difficult, I think Members should look back on this process and commend themselves for what they have accomplished.  Last September, we finalized and passed into law 5 of the 12 funding bills, an accomplishment we had not matched in over 20 years. Those five, which included the two largest bills--Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies--covered approximately 75 percent of all Federal discretionary spending.  Prior to the end of the FY 2018 year, the House also passed four additional spending bills, which we then moved to conference with the Senate.  Indeed, of the seven outstanding spending bills, six of them were negotiated with the Senate and have been ready to be moved for final passage for quite some time. The sticking point has been the final bill on that for Homeland Security, which vexed Members for some time. But though we did not reach a deal on Homeland Security quickly, we did eventually reach a deal.  Today, I am pleased to be standing with my colleagues to bring up seven bipartisan, bicameral, fully negotiated and conferenced spending bills that are ready to be passed and sent to the President's desk for signature.  As we finish the work for fiscal year 2019 and move into our efforts for fiscal year 2020, I want to commend my fellow members of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work. Thanks to the leadership of people like Ranking Member Kay Granger, Chairwoman Nita Lowey, and Chairman Rodney Frelinghuysen, and thanks to the hard work of dozens of Members, we are at last ready to send these bills to the President.  I congratulate my friends and colleagues on both sides of the aisle and, indeed, offer those same congratulations to the entire House.  I look forward to working together on fiscal year 2020 in the weeks and months ahead. Perhaps, working together, we can get all the bills passed, conferenced with the Senate, and sent to the President by the end of the fiscal year.  That will certainly be my goal and the goal of every appropriator on both sides of this Chamber and on both sides of the rotunda in the Capitol Building.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

This was a fight to reclaim the country that welcomed me as a little girl from Guatemala, to make sure that this country welcomes other children who come here fleeing violence and poverty.  This bill will prevent another stupid, costly government shutdown, and it is time that we give our Federal workers some certainty, move past this crisis, and get down to the business of governing.  Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this measure."

Beginning in 1994, VAWA has provided grants to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement officials to investigate and prosecute violent crimes against women, including domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, and stalking.  Unfortunately, VAWA is scheduled to expire, literally, tomorrow, and my friends on the other side, frankly, are just standing by and watching it happen, even though they control this Chamber.  Republicans fought to include an extension of VAWA in the underlying conference report as we had done in previous continuing resolutions, but we were rebuffed by our other friends on the other side of the aisle, and they have not made any move to schedule a separate vote on this floor to avoid a lapse in this critical program, so Republicans will.

Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cole for yielding me the time.  Madam Speaker, if the previous question is defeated, we will amend the rule to bring an extension of the Violence Against Women Act, which I have titled the Protecting Women Act of 2019.  Without action, the Violence Against Women Act will expire tomorrow at midnight. Madam Speaker, I am a survivor of domestic violence, and as a survivor of domestic violence, I am calling on all of my colleagues to reauthorize this critical bill that helps women and children who have experienced the trauma and pain of abuse and who need our support.  While we may not agree on every provision of the current Violence Against Women Act, I think we can all agree on the overall importance of this law and the programs and services it provides.  Since the Violence Against Women Act was first signed into law in 1994, it has played a vital role in supporting American women who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, dating violence, stalking, and trafficking, and improving our response to these crimes while we work to prevent them altogether.  Progress has been made, but there is more work to do. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about one in three women and one in six men experience some form of contact sexual violence during their lifetime.  I am confident that every Member of this body believes those statistics are unacceptable. I know that we agree that we must end domestic violence and care for victims left in its wake. We need to enhance awareness, work for prevention, and ensure those harmed physically and mentally have access to the resources and support they need.  A clean extension of the Violence Against Women Act through the end of the fiscal year ensures that the law and the programs it supports remain in place.  It ensures there isn't a lapse in services for those in need while we discuss ways that we can strengthen and improve it together.  As a co-chairwoman of the bipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues, I want a bill that every woman in this Chamber can support. I know that my co-chair of the Caucus, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, has also told me she wants a Violence Against Women Act that every woman in this Chamber can support.  That is why, if the previous question is defeated, Republicans will seek a vote on a clean extension of the last Violence Against Women Act reauthorization. This will give us time, Republicans and Democrats, to work toward a bipartisan solution that helps women and girls, protects religious liberties, and protects women and children.  I hope all my colleagues will recognize the importance of acting now to prevent a lapse in authorization and defeat the previous question so that we can work to protect the vulnerable from these heinous crimes."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, this is a Republican bill that we are trying to fix to keep the government open and not holding our Federal employees hostage.  I support this bill with qualifications that I know that in the 2020 fiscal year, Democrats will put forward a humane bill that addresses many of these issues. We gave $1.37 billion for barriers, not the wall.  We are protecting the environment in my own State: the Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park, the National Butterfly Center, the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge, places where I have gone and people are pleading: Don't put fences there.  We brought down the number of ICE detention beds from 49,000-50,000 to 40,000, and, of course, we have provided, as I have indicated, and fought for facilities that deal with those children and women that are coming across: $415 million for enhanced medical support; transportation; food; clothing for migrants in detention, particularly children; and $30.5 million for family case management.  As my good friend said, we brought up the alternative detention from 82,000 to 100,000. As my good friend said, there is $400 million for VAWA. We are funding these programs because we understand how important they are.  Finally, of course, in the justice area, we have given money for Byrne grants; Community Oriented Policing Services, sexual assault kits and DNA, Second Chance Act programs, and we funded NASA.  But more importantly, Madam Speaker, I think we have made a very important point that should be made, and that is, as we work toward fiscal year 2020 appropriations, it is critical that we ensure that robust accountability of DHS, including limiting the agency's transfer authority and dramatically reducing the number of people who are held in detention, utilizing proven alternatives to detention, including community-based alternatives and parole for the vast majority of people who are held in detention who pose no public safety threat or risk.  ICE--we have to realize, there must be due process and justice. It is unfortunate that this administration's treatment of immigrants is unconscionable and inhumane. We can do better and we will do better.  But the final point of all of this today is, we stand on the floor to not hold our Federal employees hostage and to open the government. I will be going forward with the qualifications of working on a better bill.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.J. Res. 31, which makes the consolidated appropriations needed to fund the departments, agencies, and programs of the federal government through September 30, 2019, and hopefully brings to a merciful end the uncertainty and hardship cruelly inflicted upon federal employees, contractors, and the American people by the President's decision to shut down the government.  I thank Chairman Lowey, Ranking Member Granger, and their fellow House conferees for their work in reaching this bipartisan agreement.  Left to our own devices, House Democrats clearly could and would have made many different and better funding decisions but this agreement is the best deal attainable in the circumstances, and importantly, it responsibly funds the government for the remainder, while securing our border.  Madam Speaker, coming from a border state, I am very pleased that this legislation does not provide the President the billions of dollars he demanded for a wasteful, ineffective, and immoral concrete wall.  In fact, it rejects the President's demand for $5.7 billion for his wall and provides instead $1.375 billion for physical barriers with language specifying that new fencing is limited to currently deployed designs--ruling out the President's border wall proposal.  My constituents and other Texans will be gratified to learn that this legislation specifically prohibits construction on sensitive environmental areas such as the Bentsen-Rio State Park, the National Butterfly Center, the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge, La Lomita Historical Park, and the Lower Rio Grande Wildlife Refuge between Brownsville, TX, and the Gulf of Mexico.  I also strongly approve that the legislation provides a path to a reduction in ICE detention beds from 49,057 today to 40,520 at the end of the fiscal year, bringing the number of detention beds back to the level of average daily population funded in the FY18 omnibus bill.  This reduction in ICE detention beds, combined with Democratic control of the Appropriations Committee and new biannual inspections of detention facilities, will provide a check on the Trump Administration's out-of-control deportation policy that targets law-abiding families instead of focusing on deporting violent criminals;  The agreement before also provides funding a more humane immigration system with $415 million for enhanced medical support, transportation, food and clothing for migrants in detention, particularly children and families; $30.5 million for family case management; an expansion in Alternatives to Detention participants from 82,000 to 100,000; and a prohibition on ICE using information collected by HHS from sponsors of migrant children for removal and deportation purposes.  I also strongly support the new investments in national security provided in the legislation, including a new Coast Guard Polar Security Cutter, the first icebreaker in over 40 years; and an $884 million increase for the Transportation Security Administration.  In addition to the bipartisan compromise on Homeland Security, the legislation before us includes six other appropriations bills that reject the President's deep budget cuts and instead make bold investments in to fund the programs Americans depend on and need to move our nation forward.  For example, the agreement funds a 1.9 percent pay raise to federal workers that overrides the President's decision to deny these hardworking and dedicated public servants a pay raise.  The agreement provides $3.8 billion for the 2020 Census, an increase of $1 billion, to ensure a fair and accurate count.  The agreement provides more than $3 billion for state and local law enforcement to keep communities safe, including by addressing the opioid crisis, closing sexual assault kit backlogs and hiring more police officers.  Madam Speaker, all Members should celebrate the fact that the agreement provides more than $17 billion in funding for new infrastructure investments to improve our roads, bridges, highways, railways and mass transit.  Another reason why I strongly support the legislation before us is because it restores and increases investments in job-creating initiatives for economic and business development, including for minority and women-owned businesses, that the Trump Administration tried to eliminate or reduce drastically.  Madam Speaker, the bipartisan agreement before us rejects the Trump Administration's attacks on the environment by blocking the Administration's deep cuts to initiatives to protect clean water, clean air and public lands and it invests more than $9 billion in the EPA and Land and Water Conservation Fund.  The agreement reinforces and strengthens America's global leadership by rejecting the Trump Administration's radical cuts and securing $9.1 billion in security assistance for allies, including $3.03 billion for Israel, $5.7 billion for PEPFAR and $1.7 billion for the Food for Peace program.  Madam Speaker, I would like to draw particular attention to provisions in the consolidated appropriations conference report that are of special interest to my congressional district.  Customs and Border Protection: $1.375 billion, $4.325 billion less than the $5.7 billion the Trump administration requested, for approximately 55 miles of physical barrier along the southern border in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.  $564 million for the installation of non-intrusive imaging equipment in the in-bound lanes of southwest border land ports of entry--significantly increasing the percentage of cars and commercial cargo scanned for narcotics and other contraband.  $415 million for humanitarian relief specifically for medical care, transportation, food and cloth; for humanitarian improvements to the McAllen Central Processing Center; and for a new El Paso CBP processing facility.  $100 million for new border security technology.  $77 million for opioid equipment and staffing for use at international mail and express consignment facilities.  $59 million for 600 new CBP Officers and encourages CBP to use fee funding to hire up to 600 additional CBP officers for a total of 1,200 new officers.  Does not fund the Administration's request for joint detention facilities.  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)--Provides an appropriated level for detention beds that establishes Congress's intent to reduce the daily population in ICE detention to approximately 40,520 by the end of the fiscal year, down from a current count of approximately 49,060.  Expands the Alternatives to Detention program from 82,000 to 100,000.  Provides $30.5 million for ATD family case management, which improves compliance with immigration court obligations by helping families' access community-based support for basic housing, healthcare, legal, and educational needs.  Provides $40 million for additional ICE staffing dedicated to overall ATD case management, particularly for asylum seekers.  Funds additional detention facility inspectors in the Office of Professional Oversight to bring the number of inspections up from once every three years to twice per year. Provides funding to bring the number of detention facilities in compliance with PREA requirements from 86 percent to 97 percent.  Provides $7.4 million for additional attorneys and for courtroom expansion to assist in the backlog of immigration cases currently in the system.  $1.9 billion for Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), which focuses on a wide variety of investigations with a cross-border nexus, including those related to human trafficking, financial crimes and cyber investigations.  $7.5 million for new HSI Victim Assistant Specialists and $44 million for new staffing to enhance opioid/fentanyl-related investigations and analyses.  No funding for additional enforcement and removal field personnel.  Coast Guard--12 billion total funding ($10.3 billion in discretionary funding) and provides for an additional 250 military personnel.  Transportation Security Agency (TSA)--$4.9 billion in net discretionary funding, an increase of $884 million above the request and $5 million above the FY 2018 enacted level.  Includes additional funding for computed tomography imaging systems and $40 million for airport explosive detection system reimbursement.  Fully funds the TSA Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response teams, staffing at exit lanes, as required by law, and the Law Enforcement Officer reimbursement program.  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)--$16.6 billion in net discretionary funding, an increase of $5.5 billion above the request and $4.2 billion above the FY 2018 enacted level.  $12 billion for disaster relief to help States, communities and citizens respond to and recover from disasters, as well as cost effective mitigation to reduce the risk from future disasters.  $3.1 billion for grants to help States, communities, citizens, and nonprofit organizations, with every grant being at or above the FY 2018 level, including $277 million for training, exercises, and education for our Nation's first responders and emergency managers.  An additional $111 million above the request for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency to address high priority cybersecurity and infrastructure protection vulnerabilities.  $10 million in direct funding for Citizenship and Integration grants, instead of relying on fee revenue to support the program.  $820 million to support cutting edge science and technology programs.  The bill includes the following provisions related to phisical barriers: continues language allowing only fencing designs in use as of 2017 and prohibits construction on sensitive environmental areas such as the Bentsen-Rio State Park, the National Butterfly Center, the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge, La Lomita Historical Park, and the Lower Rio Grande Wildlife Refuge between Brownsville, TX and the Gulf of Mexico.  The bill improves transparency by requiring ICE to make public information about the numbers and types of people in its custody, such as families; border apprehension detainees; interior enforcement detainees; and those who are in custody who have a positive credible fear claim.  Prohibits DHS from preventing a Member of Congress from entering any facility that is used to detain or otherwise house children and directs DHS to make no changes to the current operations and facility conditions in anticipation of a congressional oversight visit.  Prevents DHS from destroying any record related to potential sexual assault or abuse of any individual in DHS's custody.  Prohibits ICE from using information provided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement about sponsors or potential sponsors of unaccompanied children to arrest, detain, or remove those individuals, unless that information reveals the individual has a dangerous criminal background.  Prevents DHS from placing pregnant women in restraints who are in the custody of DHS, except in extraordinary circumstances. Provides oversight of ICE treatment of detainees, including protections for pregnant refugees, prohibiting destruction of detainee sexual assault records, and public reporting related to detainees in ICE custody.  $6.075 billion in discretionary funding for Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), which is $100 million below the FY 2018 enacted level and $325 million above the President's budget request.  $73.477 billion for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which will fully fund the program in 2019.  $23.141 billion for Child Nutrition Programs, which will fully fund the program in 2019.  International Programs: $1.716 billion for Food for Peace and $210.255 million for the McGovern-Dole International Food for Education and Child Nutrition Program.  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is funded at $3.08 billion in discretionary funding for the FDA, an increase of $269 million.  Census Bureau--$3.82 billion, an increase of more than $1 billion above FY 2018 and $20.9 million above the President's budget request, to enable the Bureau to effectively prepare for a thorough, accurate, and cost-effective 2020 Decennial Census.  U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is funded at $3.37 billion, equal to the President's budget request.  Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) Program: $140 million, equal to the FY2018 enacted level. The President had proposed completely eliminating this program.  NOAA Climate Research: $159 million, an increase of $1 million above the FY2018 enacted level and $60.4 million above the President's budget request.  National Weather Service: $1 billion for operating expenses, an increase of $6.6 million above the FY 2018 enacted level and $85.5 million above the President's budget request.  U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)--$30.9 billion overall for Department of Justice, which is more than $638 million above the FY 2018 enacted level and $2.1 billion above the President's budget request.  Federal Bureau of Investigation--$9.6 billion, an increase of $177 million above the FY 2018 enacted level and $653 million above the President's budget request.  United States Attorneys--$2.2 billion, an increase of $75 million above the FY 2018 enacted level and $107 million above the President's budget request.

Madam Speaker, the collateral damage caused by the Trump Shutdown was substantial, long lasting, and unnecessary because it could have been avoided had the President not reneged on his promise to sign the continuing resolution passed by the Senate unanimously on December 19, 2018.  Instead, the President callously shut down the government for 35 days, furloughing 800,000 civil servants and forcing nearly half that many to work without pay, which cost the national economy more than $11 billion in lost productivity and economic output.  Because the President broke his promise, frontline federal employees, including law enforcement and public safety personnel, worked without pay from December 22 through January 25, 2019.  The way these federal workers, many of whom risk their lives in the service of this country, were treated was shameful.  The shutdown forced some employees to look for new jobs or take on extra work, and the pressure was immense for employees and families with no other source of income.  Among those not receiving a pay check for their work were 3,200 Secret Service agents who risk their lives every single day to protect the President and his family.  In addition to the federal employees working without pay, hardworking federal employees at agencies like the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Agriculture, and NASA had been furloughed without pay, plunging them and their families into uncertainty.  Madam Speaker, shutting down the Government of the United States, or any portion thereof, is not an acceptable tactic or strategy for resolving differences regarding policy, funding levels, or governing philosophy.  It should never happen again.  Given the damage mercilessly inflicted on the American people and the economy by the Trump Shutdown, Congress has a fiduciary duty to the American people to ensure the continued, uninterrupted operations of the Government of the United States and its services.  And that begins with an overwhelming majority vote in support of H.J. Res. 31."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend, frankly, for his response on the VAWA issue. And I don't pretend to speak for all Republicans. I will point out to my friend, actually the last time we did a reauthorization, I voted against the Republican bill to bring the Senate Democratic bill to the floor because I thought it was a better bill. It was a stronger bill.  It had Tribal provisions and it had areas we had not addressed previously. I thought those were good changes. It is pretty unusual for me to break with my own team and bring down the Republican bill and pass the Democratic bill, but I was proud to do it because it was a better bill.  I don't think simply having money in place is the same as having the authorizations in place. This is an opportunity, in my view, to just have continuity while we do exactly what my friend suggests. Let's find a way, and come together. I think we will. That has traditionally been a bipartisan bill. I hope we do it. But I don't see a reason why we should have a lapse in authority.  This is something we tried to put, actually, in conference in the base bill, and it would not have prevented my friends from going on and offering a new authorization. It was just simply, let's keep this going.  So to me, the previous question that we will offer should the rule be defeated, will have that opportunity, and I hope my friends avail themselves of that.  In addition to that, I want to thank my friends genuinely for the cooperation in this process on the appropriations bills themselves. As I said, six of these bills were essentially agreed to in December in a bipartisan way between both the House and the Senate.  So we will hear the argument or could hear the argument tonight. All of this is new, and there is a 1,000-plus page bill, and what have you. The reality is, there are probably about 75 pages, I am told from the conferees, of new text here. Most of this is actually something that this House has voted on and passed in December.  Not reopening old issues and settling them where we could and then moving forward is something my friends ought to be proud of. I think it was absolutely the right thing to do. It let us get on to the important business of fiscal year 2020 more quickly and more expeditiously.  And my friends are in the majority, and if they want to make changes there, additions or subtractions, they will be in a position to do that. But I think closing the book here is a good one.  I hope all of us, honestly, as Republicans and Democrats--I have been around here long enough to be in the minority, in the majority, and in the minority again. It tends to move back and forth.  But as my friends have pointed out, these are important funding bills that provide for the continuity of government. And in these negotiations nobody ever gets everything they want. It is not possible, even when one side or the other controls both Chambers and the White House. I have been here when that has happened on our side and on my friend's side. You still never get everything you want in appropriations.  But I think there is going to be a premium placed on cooperation and negotiations going forward. There is no question. We have a Democratic House, we have a Republican Senate, and we have a Republican President.  Everything that we are going to accomplish in the next 18 months for the American people will have to be a compromise where we work together. I actually think this is a good first step in starting that process. I think my friends are to be commended in doing that.  We won't get every vote for this underlying legislation on our side. I doubt my friends will get every vote on their side, but we will have a pretty substantial bipartisan majority in favor of moving forward, fully funding the government and, hopefully, that sets the example for what we do in fiscal year 2020. Again, I look forward to working with my friends going forward. I look forward to beginning that process here tonight by working together to pass a bill the Senate has already passed in an overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion and that the President has said he will sign, and I assume that he certainly will.  As difficult as this road has been, Madam Speaker, I think this is actually a hopeful moment for this Chamber and maybe the beginning of good habits of negotiation, compromise, and cooperation, because we are certainly going to need those habits going forward.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time. "

We have had the opportunity to work together now in the Rules Committee for a little while. We hadn't had that opportunity previously. He is always a thoughtful and an interesting voice in that body and certainly here on the floor.  While we will disagree over the rule and might well disagree over the previous question, on the underlying legislation, I suspect my friend and I will be voting on the same side tonight.  That is something I hope that the American people take note of. We will have lots of Democrats and lots of Republicans voting on the same side. Yes, we have our differences about how we got here or what we would have liked. But at the end of the day, we have come together and given the American people what they deserve, and that is a fully funded, operational government, and we have resolved our differences in conference.  I, too, want to join my friends in congratulating the chair of the conference committee, Chair Lowey; congratulating our ranking member, Kay Granger; and congratulating their counterparts, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy for the work they did in working through these knotty issues and bringing us together.  Yes, I wish it happened more quickly, but they are not the only players. I think all four of them worked in good faith and served our Chambers well in their deliberations.  Madam Speaker, in closing, I urge support for the underlying measure. While the process of finalizing full-year funding for fiscal year 2019 may have taken longer than we expected, today's measure will complete the process. I expect the House will pass these seven bills today, and I expect that the President will sign them in the very near future.  I applaud and commend my colleagues for their hard work and hope that we will carry this spirit of bipartisanship with us as we move forward into the fiscal year 2020 appropriations process.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Madam Speaker, I thank my colleagues for joining me here today to speak on the rule and the conference report. Providing funding for the Federal Government is one of our most basic responsibilities here in the Congress. Unfortunately, the Congress in the last session failed to get it done and pass an appropriations package or even a short-term continuing resolution, and that resulted in a 35-day shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, something I hope we all can avoid from this point forward.  Starting on day one of the new Congress, House Democrats began by working to reopen the government, so we could negotiate the remaining issues on border security and finish last year's work once and for all. Today, we are accomplishing that goal.  I want to close with a thank you to the Appropriations Committee, which worked very hard to get this done. I thank the Rules Committee, where we heard every one of these appropriations bills.  I especially thank the 800,000 Federal employees affected by the shutdown, as well as the other 1.2 million Federal employees across the country. They are patriots. The employees are patriots for the work they do each and every day on behalf of our country and our citizens.  I met with dozens of Federal employees during the shutdown. I heard about the uncertainty of how to pay bills and the mental anguish from being sidelined from work because they were not excepted or essential. Despite all that, I still heard that they were proud of their work of 10, 20, even 25 years in public service and how they just wanted to get back to their jobs.  Madam Speaker, I say to Mr. Cole that I am hopeful, too, that we can come together on these important responsibilities. There are going to be basic disagreements, and hopefully, we can work together to iron out most of those. But shutting down the government is something we have to avoid from this point forward. So I hope the lessons we in Congress learned from the shutdown are not forgotten, and we continue working together to prevent this from happening again.  Madam Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on the rule and on the previous question.  The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:       At the end of the resolution, add the following:       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the      House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the      bill (H.R. 1239) to reauthorize Department of Justice      programs that combat violence against women, and for other      purposes. All points of order against consideration of the      bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All      points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.      The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the      bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without      intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally      divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority      member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion      to recommit.       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the      consideration of H.R. 1239."

On behalf of the people of the Ninth Congressional District of New York, I would like to congratulate Spike Lee, a son of Brooklyn, on receiving the first-ever best director Oscar nomination despite a more than 30-year career in film.  He joins the ranks of only six other African Americans to ever be nominated for the category.  Mr. Lee was raised in Brooklyn and attended Morehouse College, where he received a bachelor of arts in mass communications. He received a fine arts degree from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts.  Many of Mr. Lee's films have examined race relations, colorism in the Black community, and the role of the media in contemporary life and political issues.  Spike has never ceased to speak out against injustice in the Black community.  He has been outspoken on police brutality, environmental injustice, and other issues that affect communities in Brooklyn and beyond.  His love of Brooklyn is reflected in his activism and his work.  Forty Acres and a Mule, Spike's production company, is based in Brooklyn, contributing in part to the economy that keeps our city running.  He shot films like ``Do the Right Thing'' and ``Crooklyn'' in Brooklyn, allowing viewers to experience all that we know and love about Brooklyn.  Spike Lee continues to produce work that pushes the envelope on topics that need to be discussed. ``BlacKkKlansman,'' for which he is being nominated, has received praise and adoration for its topics around combating racism."

I do want to address this bill we just passed. I had hoped to vote for it after I was hearing, well, it is not much money; it is less than $2 billion. But the trouble is there are provisions in here that are going to make it difficult to remove anybody who is here if they have got a child in there.  And, yes, I know, there is language that says if it is based on information shared by HHS, so that means they are going to be covered up with discovery requests, FOIA requests, probably people will find Obama judges who let people out.  This was not a good bill in the end. That is why I had to vote ``no.''"

This border security and funding bill that Democrats fixed did some good things. In particular, it raised the number to 100,000 alternative detention sites for women and children; it provided healthcare where there was no healthcare so that little children would not die at the border; and it prevented ICE from using data to deport people who are trying to pick up their children.  The good news is our Federal employees will not be held as hostages, and we have given them a 1.9 percent raise. As well, we provided for Food for Peace, for people who are struggling around the world, $1.7 billion.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, we provided $423 million for the Byrne Grant; $178 million to address sexual assault kits and other DNA; $100 million for STOP School Violence; $497 million, Madam Speaker, for the Violence Against Women Act; and $75 million for gun control, or at least the checks for background.

So, Madam Speaker, I just rise to point out that we are hearing a lot tonight about an emergency declaration; and if 30,000 to 40,000 Americans, including these young angels, losing their lives every single year is not an emergency, I don't know what is.  This House, after 8 years of inaction and pathetic moments of silence, moved a bill, H.R. 8, for universal background checks out of committee yesterday.

Bob's service to the people of Northwest Indiana is worthy of our deepest admiration. Mr. Crossk passed away at the age of 86 on Sunday, January 27, 2019, but the impact he has had on his community will live on for generations to come.   Robert Crossk epitomized what it means to be a civil servant, working tirelessly and without self-interest for all the residents of Lake County, Indiana. Mr. Crossk served on the Hobart City Council from 1979 to 1983 before his election to the Lake County Council. Councilman Crossk went on to represent the sixth district of Lake County from 1983 to 1998. Bob was a remarkable civic leader who was known for his hard work, dedication, and integrity. A union man by trade, Bob was a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers Local 150 for much of his life. Mr. Crossk also devoted much of his energy to charitable organizations such as the Knights of Columbus and Veterans of Foreign Wars. For his passionate dedication to helping others throughout his lifetime, Bob Crossk is truly worthy of the highest praise.   Robert Crossk leaves to cherish his memory a loving family. He is survived by his wonderful wife, Gladys, and their four beloved daughters, two sons, six grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren, not to mention many other dear friends and family members whose lives have been enriched by having known him. Bob will also be forever remembered by a grateful community of Lake County residents who he selflessly served with distinction for so many years.   I especially want to note that I have known Bob for my entire life. For every one of those days, I have only known Mr. Crossk to be a gentleman, possessed an expansive and warm personality, and an unflagging generosity of spirit.

As a business leader, philanthropist, and tireless advocate for opening new opportunities for people of color, John has a history of exceptional contributions to our civic life that continue to the present day.   Born and raised in the City of Chicago, John Rogers, Jr. is the product of parents notable for their own achievements: his father was a judge and former Tuskegee Airman, and his mother was the first African-American woman to graduate from the University of Chicago Law School and to argue a case before the United States Supreme Court. After completing his secondary education at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, John attended Princeton University where he earned a degree in Economics and co-captained the school's Ivy League championship varsity basketball team. His interest in finance can be traced to a gift of stock for his 12th birthday, a present that ignited a lifelong fascination with investment and the complexities of financial valuation.   After two years working as a stockbroker at a Chicago investment banking firm, John launched an investment fund informed by his understanding that the highest returns are generated by patience and a research-driven approach to uncovering hidden value. That methodology has built Ariel Investments, LLC into a highly respected firm employing more than 100 analysts and staff and managing more than $11 billion in assets. John's financial acumen is valued by the boards of directors of some of our nation's largest and most consequential enterprises, including the New York Times Company, Exelon and Nike.   The achievements of John Rogers, Jr. are not limited to the world of finance--his civic engagement extends to cultural institutions (he is a life trustee of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra), and he has been a bold champion committed to strengthening underserved communities and addressing inequities experienced by people of color. He is the first African-American recipient of Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson award, recognizing his service to the Princeton University alumni community and to organizations including the Chicago Urban League (where he is a life director), the Rainbow PUSH Coalition Wall Street Project, and Project Vote (an organization dedicated to enfranchising underserved communities and empowering individuals to exercise their constitutional right to vote). He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, is a trustee of the University of Chicago, and, either personally or through Ariel Investments, generously endowed scholarships for under-resourced students at the Laboratory Schools, provided seed money to underwrite an investment fund that introduces financial management to students at Ariel Community Academy (a K-8 school in the Chicago Public School system), and funded a finance internship program for University of Chicago students of color interested in careers in financial services. John also serves on the Board of Directors for the Obama Foundation, where he works to help build the next generation of civic leaders.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of the grateful citizens of Illinois, I want to thank John W. Rogers, Jr. for all that he has done and all that he continues to do to improve our nation and to open opportunities historically inaccessible to communities of color."

It is an honor to recognize a nation with such rich and vibrant history and whose immigrants and descendants have enriched the cultural landscape of our nation.  Chicagoland is fortunate to be home to the largest Lithuanian diaspora population in the world. With Little Lithuania on the Southwest Side of Chicago and a significant part of the community in Lemont and Cicero, I am proud to represent a part of this heritage. The celebration of Lithuania's 101st anniversary pays due respect to the signing of Lithuania's Act of Independence on February 16, 1918, an act that sought to restore an independent state. Although true independence was not achieved until after World War I and the fall of the German Empire, this single rebellious act paved the way for what has become a free and democratically governed state. Lithuanian-Americans have reason to celebrate their heritage proudly.  One such place where Chicagoan Lithuanians have found a home is in Marquette Park at the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish, founded by Lithuanian immigrants in 1927. A beautiful new church was constructed in 1957 incorporating influences from the Lithuanian folk baroque style and Lithuanian folk art. This includes a gold-plated reproduction of the Virgin Mary from a shrine in Siluva, Lithuania. Now led by Pastor Juanius Kelpsas and Father Gediminas Kersys, this beautiful church continues to receive numerous parishioners and visitors, each bearing witness to a rich component of Lithuanian-American history.  In 2015 I had the opportunity to visit Lithuania with a congressional delegation led by then-Speaker Boehner to celebrate and strengthen the bonds between our countries. I had a wonderful experience meeting Lithuanians and enjoying the beauty of the country in Vilnius and on the Baltic Coast. One of my most cherished memories was my visit to Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn.  Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in honoring Lithuanian Independence Day. At home, I have witnessed firsthand the positive contributions Lithuanian-Americans bring to our local community, and I trust that the bonds between our two nations will remain strong."

In life, Mrs. Medina embodied a selfless dedication to her family, her innumerable friends, and the larger community of Kansas City, Missouri. Throughout her ninety-five years of life, Mrs. Medina served the people around her with a generous spirit and a warm heart.  Mrs. Medina was born to Cristobal Garcia and Carlota Hernandez in 1923. Throughout her life, Mrs. Medina always put her faith and her family first, both as a loving wife to Agustin ``Chino'' Medina and as a mother to their four children. She is survived by her children and their spouses; Enrique and Maria Chaurand, Cris and Mary Medina, Mike and Yolanda Casey, and Sandy Medina; as well as nine grandchildren and eleven great grandchildren.  Teresa Garcia Medina grew up in the Historic Westside of Kansas City, Missouri, a predominantly Latino community, and attended Our Lady of Guadalupe School. During this time, Teresa and her sister, Jessie Nieto, would make friends and community ties that would last a lifetime. Mrs. Medina and her sister would later use the skills they learned at Our Lady of Guadalupe to work as tailors at Jack Henry on the Plaza. Far from forgetting the community from which she came, Mrs. Medina continued to give back through her work as a member of La Union Cultural Mexicana Femenina and Las Guadalupanas. The legacy of her impact on the community continues through her children and grandchildren, as they remain active in the Latino community of the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area.  Throughout her life, Mrs. Medina's personal faith was the central focus. She served steadfastly as a member of the Sacred Heart/Guadalupe Catholic Parish for many decades. In the 1990s she worked alongside other Mexican-American women of her congregation to preserve Las Guadalupanas when the Bishop and other leadership threatened to close their chapel. Traveling from door-to-door, gathering support and financial resources, these devout women successfully fought to keep the institution open as a pillar of the community. Actions like this demonstrate the fervent faith that Mrs. Medina carried with her and why she was cherished by all who knew her.  Those who knew her said they would always remember her warm smile and her gentle ways, her kindness to the neighborhood children, and her love for her community. Mrs. Medina personified the full and overflowing life of a Catholic and lived each day to the fullest. She was beloved by those who knew her and will be missed by all.  Please join me and all of Missouri's Fifth Congressional District in honoring Mrs. Teresa Garcia Medina for her commitment to social justice and her contributions to the Latino community in Kansas City.

USPS has jurisdiction over this program and, from time to time, has implemented its interpretations that diverge from Congressional intent of the Rural Services Improvement Act (RSIA)--a law that I helped develop with my former Senate colleague Ted Stevens, and which governs the USPS mail-delivery system for Alaska.  The intent of RSIA is very similar to the intent of the USPS funding included in the Financial Services appropriations bill--to ensure that rural postal delivery is maintained at prior year levels and to prevent the closure of important rural post offices.  There is only one airline in Alaska that now delivers mail and passengers ``from the first to the last mile'' to the far reaches of the State--to Native communities, to communities on the Aleutian chain, and the northern-most towns and villages in the State. This airline, Ravn Air, has been disadvantaged by the USPS's interpretation of RSIA that does not grant the air carrier the status as an ``existing mainline carrier'' under the statute. This status will help further ensure that viable passenger service and mail delivery is maintained throughout the State.  From time to time, it is fair and appropriate for USPS to objectively reevaluate its interpretation of RSIA to provide an updated application of the law and to consider Ravn for this status.  I intend to follow up with USPS and its new Commissioners regarding this request. The entire Alaska Congressional Delegation has previously written USPS on this matter and I will continue to reach out to my Senate Colleagues for review of this with USPS in light of changes within USPS itself, and changes in the airline industry and marketplace in Alaska.  I thank my colleagues and with that I will vote for passage of the Financial Services bill as part of the final FY '19 Appropriations package."

Graham--or Bubba as he's known to his friends--started his career in 1973 and retires today as the Vice President of Barnhill Contracting Company after 46 years of service in Fayetteville, North Carolina. He graduated from North Carolina State University in 1973 with a degree in engineering, and in that same year he married his lovely wife, Betty Gail. Together they've raised two children, Landis and Gray, and one grandchild, Evelyn.  Over the years, Bubba has become a pillar of the community. While the list of his community involvements is quite extensive, Bubba has time and again stepped up to help our soldiers, veterans and their families--no small feat considering Fayetteville is home to Fort Bragg, the largest military installation in the world. Bubba has served as the Vice-Chair of the Ft Bragg Special Activities Committee, Chairman of the Military Affairs Council of the Fayetteville Chamber of Commerce, and on the Board of Directors for the Sandhills Military Council.  On top of these public positions, Bubba has always been known as someone who wanted to help our troops behind the scenes. Bubba went to visit soldiers in Afghanistan at Bagram Air Field in Kandahar and delivered Christmas gifts and Holiday Cheer to our deployed soldiers. He also helped organized family trips for Gold Star family members and was instrumental in supporting children of deployed soldiers attend exclusive productions of ``Disney on Ice'' at the Crown Center. These were things that may not have received public attention, but that didn't matter to Bubba; he just cared about giving back to the place he's called home for so long.  I wish Bubba a long and happy retirement, and I know I speak for countless people in the community when I say he will be missed at Barnhill Contracting Company.  Madam Speaker, please join me in congratulating Bubba for his incredible career and service to our community."

This Texas trailblazer was born in Houston on September 17, 1925, and graduated high school at the young age of 14. Johnnie Mae then enrolled in Mary Allen Jr. College--the first black women's college in the state of Texas. During her time at Mary Allen, Johnnie Mae was a strong academic student and her skills in mathematics allowed her to become a member of the prestigious Kappa Epsilon Honor Society. Outside of the classroom, Johnnie Mae was able to foster her love of music--which was developed early on in her childhood--by taking advantage of Mary Allen's music program and singing in the college choir. While working in the school library, Johnnie Mae discovered a deep passion for education that propelled her to earn her master's degree from Texas Southern University in 1951.  Johnnie Mae was able to combine her passions of education and music as a fifth-grade music teacher in Navasota, Texas--a job that gave her ample opportunity to spread her love of music to new generations.  It comes as no surprise to those who know her best that Johnnie Mae's professional career was defined by her commitment to living a service-oriented life. No matter what she was doing, be it teaching music to children, volunteering in her local church, or educating the future generations of Texans--Johnnie Mae did it with an infectious attitude of positivity and joy. Whether it's through her involvement in the church or her rigorous social schedule, Johnnie Mae continues to be a prominent figure in her community, even now at the age of 93.  Johnnie Mae Brooks-Dale Thompson has led a life of selfless service and spiritual devotion--always embodying her adage: ``Before you do something that is nice or negative, think how you would feel if someone did this to you.'' Let us celebrate not only institutions like Mary Allen College, but also individuals like Johnnie Mae. I know I join her family, friends, and the entire Eighth District of Texas in honoring all she has accomplished thus far in her extraordinary life."

As a member of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity myself, I am especially proud to recognize this great accomplishment. It is truly an honor to celebrate the Beta Lambda Chapter's Centennial observance on February 17, 2019 in Kansas City, Missouri.  The Beta Lambda Chapter was chartered in January 1919 with ten charter members who laid a strong foundation of fraternal fellowship in the Greater Kansas City Metropolitan Area. The effort to organize the Beta Lambda Chapter in Kansas City, Missouri began in April 1918, upon the request of graduate members of the fraternity who resided in Kansas City. An application for the Chapter was made during the 1918 convention held in Cleveland, Ohio by Brothers T.C. Brown, W.H. Bruce, L.H. Norwood, Thomas Taylor, J. Oliver Morrison and Guy Booker. Favorable action was taken by the convention and the Chapter was established in January 1919 making it the second oldest graduate chapter and first graduate chapter west of the Mississippi River. The charter members of the Beta Lambda Chapter were all outstanding members of the Kansas City community and of their respective professions. Faced with cultural realities of the early Twentieth Century, these charter members found in each other a source of mutual support, enlightenment and a retreat of friendship and fraternity. Each sensed a significant void created by the pervasive permanence of American institutional racism and exclusionary practices that were predominant during that era. Throughout its history, the Beta Lambda Chapter has proudly upheld the high standards of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity.  Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Incorporated was founded in 1906 at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Our founding Jewels are Henry Arthur Callis, Charles Henry Chapman, Eugene Kinckle Jones, George Biddle Kelley, Nathanial Allison Murray, Robert Harold Ogle, and Vertner Woodson Tandy.  Beta Lambda has been privileged to host the Thirteenth Annual Convention in 1920, Twenty-Eighth Annual Convention in 1940, Thirty-Sixth Annual Convention in 1950, Seventy-Fourth Annual Convention in 1988 and Eighty-Eighth Annual Convention in 2008. Beta Lambda won the ``McGee Memorial Cup'' as Outstanding National Chapter from 1945 to 1947. Additionally, the Beta Lambda Chapter won National Alumni Chapter of the Year in 1997 for its leadership and service in social justice, education and development for mankind.  Beta Lambda is led today by Hon. Ardie A. Bland, Damon E. Roath as Vice President, and William A. Griffin as Recording Secretary. Additional officers include: Johnathan Bernard, Terence M. Goree, Joseph C. Lewis, Rev. Kevin L. Nelson, Howard A. Berry, Eric J. Halliburton and Thomas A. Phillips.  One hundred years in the life of any person, organization or institution is a significant milestone and serves as a testament of fidelity to principles, seriousness of purpose and devotion to goals and objectives. Thus, the reason for intentional recognition to such an amazing local treasure.  Madam Speaker, please join me and our colleagues in expressing our collective congratulations to the Beta Lambda Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity and extending our heartfelt wishes for even greater success as it begins its second century."

Mr. Boswell is a lifelong resident of Wilson, North Carolina.  James Marshall Boswell was born on February 2, 1919 in Wilson, North Carolina. His parents taught him and his three brothers to work hard, although neither his mother nor father had more than a fifth grade education. His father supported the family as a factory worker. Mr. Boswell recalls him sharing two double beds with his three brothers in their rented home. He would later go to work with his father at the wagon factory where he would perform hard manual labor for 40 hours a week, earning $12 per week. He worked at the factory until a friend offered him a job at a drive-in making $15 a week. In 1938, James wed his beloved wife, Alma ``Mozelle'' Woodall Boswell. They were married for 76 years until her passing in 2014.  Mr. Boswell was working for the FBI in Washington, D.C. when Japan attacked the United States in 1941. Mr. Boswell felt it was his duty to serve his country, so he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps at the start of World War II. He qualified to fly the new B-17 Flying Fortress. He flew 51 combat missions throughout Italy, France, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Greece, Germany, and Austria during his three years of service. Mr. Boswell credits the Tuskegee Airmen for his crews' safe returns, and says he remained in contact with many of them for several years after returning home.  James Boswell's three brothers also served our country with honor. The youngest, Harvey, served as a Merchant Marine. George Boswell served with the 8th and 9th Air Forces in Europe during World War II. Delmar was a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne.  Having worked most of his life, James Boswell returned home to Wilson where he opened a grocery store, the Super Food Center, located on Herring Avenue.  In addition to his service to our country, Mr. Boswell has selflessly given of his time and efforts to work in his community, serving as a Mason and Shriner for nearly 65 years. He is also a faithful member of First Christian Church in Wilson, where he has held several positions in leadership including chairman, elder, and deacon. Today, James Boswell continues to drive himself to Faith Christian Church every Sunday.  The most important thing to James Boswell has always been his family. He has one daughter, Debby Boswell Keller of North Carolina, and one son, James Boswell, Jr. of Illinois. In describing her father, Debby stated, ``he is the most caring and giving person I know.''  James Boswell has lived an incredible life that, by the grace of God, has spanned an entire century. His selfless and lifelong dedication to his country and community are beyond remarkable, and he is truly an inspiration and role model for us all. His love for his family, friends, church, and community knows no bounds.  Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay tribute to such a dedicated and honorable veteran. I am immensely proud to have Mr. James Marshall Boswell as a constituent, and I wish him a very Happy 100th birthday. May God continue to bless him and his family."

This bipartisan legislation will spur private investment in public building infrastructure throughout the United States by creating $5 billion in Private Activity Bonds for the development of government-owned public buildings.  In every American community, there are serious concerns about the condition of our schools, public hospitals, justice facilities, universities, police and fire stations. With state and local budgets becoming increasingly strained, officials have chosen to save money by steadily reducing capital investment in public buildings. But years of underinvestment have led to facilities that are inadequately maintained, fail to comply with current codes or disability requirements, and do not have adequate security--endangering the general public. Throughout the country, the average public-school building is at least 40 years old, and the current backlog of maintenance and repair projects adds up to more than $45 billion annually in unmet funding needs. The Public Buildings Renewal Act will reverse this trend by unlocking private sector capital for the public's benefit. It is past time that we upgrade our public buildings to provide a safe, modern, and efficient experience from coast to coast.  While this legislation is not a panacea to solve all of our infrastructure needs, it is an important aspect of our strategy to rebuild and renew America.

On this day eight years ago, thousands of Bahrainis gathered in peaceful protests to demand greater political freedom, and political and constitutional reform.  Their demands were not new--the roots went back to the 1970s.  They were not radical: Bahrainis wanted greater popular participation in governance, equal access to socio-economic opportunities and development, action against corruption and an end to the practice of political naturalization.  And they were not sectarian--even though Bahrain is a majority Shi'a country ruled by a minority Sunni monarchy.  But by the end of March 2011, what started as a moment of hope had been met with massive repression by the Bahraini government and security forces sent by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. As protests grew and spread, at least 35 people died, some 3,000 people were injured, thousands were detained or lost their jobs, and many were brutally tortured, including medical doctors.  King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa of Bahrain did take some steps to address the people's demands. His appointment of the 5-member Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry BICI) to examine the government's response to the protests was an important gesture. And the 26 recommendations contained in the BICI report, which the monarch promised to implement, did inspire some new hope that change was possible.  Many of us in Congress urged the government to fully implement the BICI recommendations and to cease the repression of human rights defenders and peaceful opposition leaders.  But in the years since, hope has been completely dashed. Some initial important reforms have been rolled back, opposition political societies are banned, peaceful human rights defenders and popular opposition leaders are spending their lives in jail, sectarian divisions have hardened, hundreds have been stripped of their citizenship, no independent press remains, the most recent elections were a sham--and to top it all off, the Bahraini government has supported the Saudis in the brutal war in Yemen and the senseless embargo of Qatar.  Madam Speaker, some observers turn a blind eye to Bahrain's increasingly authoritarian rule because they accept Bahrain's argument that Iran is to blame for encouraging the Shi'a population to rebel.  These days, any mention of Iran is often enough to silence legitimate criticism.  But what I see is a Bahraini government whose own policies deepen sectarian divisions and create the conditions for unrest.  In spite of their majority status, Bahraini Shiites are less likely to hold jobs in the all-important public sector. They are almost entirely disqualified from serving in the police or military. They live in highly segregated neighborhoods with inferior public services compared to Sunni areas. They are systematically underrepresented in the lower house of parliament.  No one should be surprised that this stark political and economic inequality causes grievance. Add to that Bahrain's crushing of political expression and channels of participation, and you have a recipe for fostering extremism.  No government that does this can be considered a true United States ally in the war against terrorism. You cannot claim to be fighting extremism when your own policies foster it.  On this anniversary, I renew my call to the government of Bahrain to free Nabeel Rajab, Sheikh Ali Salman, Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Abduljalil Al-Singace, Ahmed Humaidan, Naji Fateel and all other prisoners of conscience jailed for exercising their most fundamental human rights.  And I call on the government to end the prohibition on political societies, decriminalize all speech, allow national and international press to operate without state intervention, stop rendering its citizens stateless, strip the National Security Agency of its power to arrest, bring its anti-terrorism legislation into line with international human rights standards, integrate its security forces and end discrimination against the Shi'a population everywhere it exists.  Only if these steps are taken will the rights of all the Bahraini people, the country's long-term stability and America's national interests be assured."

Born in San Francisco, Victor developed a childhood passion for fishing that has greatly informed his public service throughout his life. His focus on salmon began after his family moved to Mill Valley: he fished off the waters of Sausalito on his first boat when he was still in high school.  Following high school, Victor began to race motorcycles and started his own repair and custom engine fabrication facility. He rented a workspace from a local auto dealership, and eventually ran the dealership's parts and service center. Victor would go on to buy the dealership and move it to Petaluma, adding a second dealership soon thereafter.  As Victor built up his dealership and custom racing business, he never lost sight of his passion for salmon fishing. In 2008, when California experienced the first closure of ocean salmon fishing, Victor took action and founded the Golden Gate Salmon Association to restore California's largest salmon runs. In doing so, Victor would make California history by bringing together disparate stakeholders, including leaders from the commercial and sport fishing industries, conservation groups, and businesses connected to fishing, for a common cause. Over the next few years, Victor developed the financial and logistical backbone of the organization, coordinated fundraisers throughout Northern California, and assembled community leaders to support the organization's mission.  After establishing Golden Gate Salmon Association, Victor spearheaded its development of a plan to restore Central Valley salmon runs, utilizing available science and research funded by the organization. This process would be the beginning of a number of critical restoration projects that the organization sponsored and successfully completed, with many still underway.  Madam Speaker, as ocean life continues to decline all over the world, organizations like Golden Gate Salmon Association are critical in protecting the natural habitat, wildlife, and fisheries that we all rely on and cherish. We therefore ask our colleagues to join us in thanking Victor Gonella for his tireless efforts to not only protect valuable natural resources but the communities that rely on them."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, today I rise to join my colleagues in discussing the disparaging effects of homelessness and housing insecurity in our communities.  In 2018, communities across the country faced a continuing housing affordability crisis that left thousands of Americans homeless and without any stable place to live.  For the second year in a row, the number of people experiencing homelessness in the United States increased.  In 2018, 552,830 people lived in emergency shelters, transitional housing, or were not sheltered at all.  This is nearly 2,000 more people than in 2017.  This is an ongoing problem that demands our immediate attention.  The state of Texas claims just under 9 percent of the population of the United States.  Sadly, 23,548 people are homeless in Texas.  This is 4 percent of the country's entire homeless population.  More than 10,000 men and women can be found on the streets of Houston, homeless, on any given night.  Of these, 3,000 are considered chronically homeless.  Those who are categorized as chronically homeless are people who have been continuously homeless for a year or more or those who have been homeless four or more times in the past three years.  Many of the chronically homeless suffer from a mental illness and/or a substance abuse problem. Percy Lyons is one of these people whose home does not come with an address.  Mr. Lyons has made his home under a bridge.  He has all the comforts of home: a military cot, tucked behind a cement barrier, for a bed; a propane stove, hidden in a drainpipe, for cooking and heat; and hollow cement blocks function as shelves to hold his few articles of clothing and an extra pair of shoes.  Mr. Lyons is just one of those 3,000 people who are surviving on the streets of Houston.  Thankfully, Houston Police Department (HPD) is trying to help meet the needs of the city's homeless population.  HPD has created the Homeless Outreach Team.  This team is staffed with four officers, who instead of responding to complaints or ordinance violations, work on building relationships with those who live on the streets.  These heroes work with Houston's homeless residents to navigate the social services available and have helped hundreds of people move off the streets and into permanent housing.  These officers can discuss success stories, like that of Randall.  Randall spent over 30 years living on the streets.  The Homeless Outreach Team was able to help Randall get into a treatment program.  Unfortunately, there are not more stories like Randall.  Instead, the majority of those who are chronically homeless slip through the cracks, unable to find their way through the complex system of social services.  Each night in the United States of America an estimated 553,000 men, women, and children spend the night on the streets.  This is a national emergency."

                "speech":" Mr. President, yesterday Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, and their House counterparts continued finalizing their legislative proposal to fund the government. Their negotiated solution would wrap up this year's appropriations and avoid another partial government shutdown.  As our colleagues hammer out the final details, I would like to thank them again for their cooperative, bipartisan efforts that have brought us to this point. The agreement reached on Monday was achieved because the conference committee set aside far-left poison pills and utterly absurd demands. None of these radical nonstarters was allowed to torpedo the process.  Notwithstanding weeks of over-the-top rhetoric from Speaker Pelosi, the agreement did not cave to the far-left demand that no more than a single dollar go toward new barriers on the southern border--no, indeed, it provides well over a billion such dollars. The negotiators also prevented last-minute efforts to hamstring the U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement with an unprecedented statutory limit on their ability to detain criminal aliens in the interior of our country.  Instead, here is what their agreement does provide. It provides another significant downpayment on the President's plan to secure our Nation's borders with new physical barriers and keep American communities safe. It provides nearly $1.4 billion for new barriers in the Border Patrol's highest priority areas--enough to build nearly twice as many miles as were funded last year. It gives ICE the capacity and the flexibility to continue responding to surges in illegal immigration. It continues to provide the President with appropriate reprogramming authority, so he can direct additional funding toward urgent homeland security priorities should circumstances require. Of course, in addition to all this, the legislation will wrap up all our outstanding regular appropriations bills and get the entire Federal Government funded the right way.  It goes without saying that neither side is getting everything it wants. That is the way it goes in divided government. If the text of the bill reflects the principles agreed to on Monday, it won't be a perfect deal, but it will be a good deal.  I hope that our colleagues will complete the process of turning these principles into legislation soon and final text that can become law before this Friday's deadline.  We can't let any unrelated, cynical, partisan plays get in the way of finishing this important process. I understand, for example, that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are apparently objecting, believe it or not, to a modest extension of the Violence Against Women Act. They want this authority to expire on Friday.  Republicans believe that we should follow standard procedure and extend this important legislation through the end of the fiscal year, which is about 7 months. There are new chairmen in this Congress of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, and a modest extension of this authority would allow them to work on a longer term reauthorization of this important law. In addition, a modest extension of this law is consistent with how this matter has been handled in the past. Every time a continuing resolution was necessary in the past Congress, Republicans made sure it included an extension of VAWA.  I don't know what cynical ploy my Democratic colleagues may be trying to pull here, but surely no political maneuvering should be worth letting the Violence Against Women Act lapse this Friday, 2 days from now. It is time to get this done."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as I alluded to earlier this week, I have a feeling this conference is just getting started discussing Speaker Pelosi's signature bill, H.R. 1. I, for one, am eager to continue shining the spotlight on the Democrat Politician Protection Act and asking why, exactly, Washington Democrats are so intent on assigning themselves a whole lot more power over what American citizens can say about politics, how we can say it, and how we cast our ballots.  Remember, among the many fairly blatant power plays built into this legislation is a naked attempt to turn our neutral Federal Election Commission into a partisan weapon. The FEC is a body that, since Watergate and for obvious reasons, has had an even-numbered membership and equal division between the two parties. Enforcement and penalty require both parties to agree, or at least one Commissioner from one party has to agree with three Commissioners of the other party. This is meant to ensure that complaints are evaluated on their substance, not for purely political considerations.  I guess Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are tired of playing fair and trying to persuade the old-fashioned way because the Democrat Politician Protection Act would take the FEC down to a five-member body and give sitting Presidents--listen to this one--it would give sitting Presidents the power to appoint the Chairperson. They would turn the FEC into a nakedly partisan body and give the sitting President the power to appoint the Chairperson--where his or her party would have a 3-to-2 advantage--who holds the keys to determine whom to investigate and what enforcement to pursue.  The evenness of the FEC is a vital way to ensuring that Americans' political speech and campaigns for public office are regulated fairly and evenhandedly. Of course, that needs to be done on a bipartisan basis, but the Democrats want to throw that right out the window and carve out a partisan majority on this crucial Commission.  This proposal is outrageous enough on its face, but just wait until you hear about all the new things the Democrat Politician Protection Act would let this newly partisan FEC actually do.  First, they turn it over to the party of the President, so they have a clear majority to go after the minority. But let's see what they can do. There are incredibly vague new standards that seem tailor-made to give this partisan FEC the maximum latitude to penalize or silence certain speech. You begin to get the picture. Of course, this partisan FEC is going to want to silence the voices of its opponents.  Let me give a few examples.  The newly partisan FEC would be handed the ability to determine what kind of speech is ``campaign-related''--growing its jurisdiction and widening its bureaucratic wingspan over more of the public discourse, including issues of the day and not just elections.  Private citizens, for example, would be required to make the government aware of times they spend even small amounts of money in engaging in First Amendment activities. Private citizens have to notify the government if they are going to engage in spending small amounts of money on First Amendment activities--on expressing themselves--or they will face penalties. More speech would fall into this category whereby Americans would have to dutifully notify Federal bureaucrats that they are speaking their minds or else pay a fine. To put it another way, it is free speech as long as you fill out government forms and mail a couple of carbon copies to Washington.  In other cases, the Democrats want to impose stunningly vague, broad, and potentially unconstitutional restrictions on the abilities of all kinds of advocacy groups--on all sides of the political spectrum--to exercise their constitutional right to speak out about elected politicians and their positions on substantive issues.  Let's go over that again because I know this is a technical subject.  Under the guise of cracking down on ``super PAC coordination,'' the Democrats want to give a partisan FEC new powers to prohibit advocacy groups from weighing in on politicians' job performances and the issues of the day under a broad set of new conditions. Washington Democrats want individual American citizens, civic groups, trade associations, labor unions, and nonprofits to face more restrictions, more hurdles, and more potential penalties for daring to have opinions about the political races that decide who goes to Washington in the first place.  Call me old-fashioned, but I remember when both political parties were more interested in trying to win debates than in trying to shut down debates. This will be an FEC designed to stifle free speech and tilt the playing field in the direction of the President's party. I remember when constitutionally minded leaders on both sides of the aisle would have recoiled at efforts to chill or even to prohibit a private citizen's ability to speak.  Let's not forget, in every one of these cases, when these fuzzy, new lines and vague rules need enforcing, who has the final say? Why, it is the newly partisan Federal Election Commission that determines who gets to speak and who doesn't. My Democratic colleagues are trying to muddy the rule book and mount a hostile takeover of the referees all at the same time.  Let me just close with this. Back in 1974, as the creation of the FEC was debated here in this Chamber, California Democratic Senator Alan Cranston gave this warning: ``The FEC has such a potential for abuse in our democratic society that the President should not be given power over the Commission.''  Wise words.  Back then, a California Democrat was warning against a partisan takeover of the American electoral system. It is the distinguished Member of the House from San Francisco, Speaker Pelosi, who is now, today, cheerleading for that very change.  The Democratic Party has changed its views on this subject a lot in the last 45 years, but the purpose of the FEC has not changed one bit, and neither has the importance of the First Amendment."

                "speech":"Mr. President, we have a clear and obvious way to avoid another government shutdown in 48 hours. The conference committee has done its job. It has forged a bipartisan agreement that would keep the government open through September as well as provide additional border security.  As with all bipartisan agreements, it is the product of compromise. Each side gave a little; each side got a little. The conferees deserve our praise for their hard work, their commitment, and their success.  This agreement is the last train leaving the station away from another dreaded government shutdown. The last time we were all in this situation, the President signaled his support for a government funding bill, only for him to retreat at the last possible moment--precipitating the longest shutdown in our history. It was the Trump shutdown, and he now seems to admit that again.  No one wants to see a rerun of that movie. The President must not repeat his mistakes of the recent past.  President Trump, sign this bill.  Neither side got everything it wanted in this bill, but both sides wanted to avoid another shutdown--Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate.  President Trump, sign this bill.  The parameters of the deal are good. It provides additional funding for smart, effective border security. Let me repeat that. It does not fund the President's wall, but it does fund smart border security that both parties support. It also provides humanitarian assistance and beefs up security at our ports of entry. Though it hasn't been discussed much during the negotiations, the passage of this agreement clears the way for the six bipartisan appropriations bills that have languished. These bills contain important priorities, including more support for infrastructure, housing, Tribal healthcare, the census, and money to combat the opioid crisis. I look forward to passing all of these appropriations bills, alongside the DHS agreement, this week.  One of the last things that has to be dealt with is the negotiating of a good compromise to fix some of the problems that have been created by the Trump shutdown. We are trying to get the conferees to approve a proposal to deal with Federal contractors. Thousands of Federal contractors have not been reimbursed from the 35-day shutdown. This issue is still hanging in the balance. The Republicans should join the junior Senator from Minnesota and the Democrats in approving this legislation as soon as possible.  The contractors, many of them just working people, are in the same boat as government employees, except they haven't gotten their backpay. They should. No one should stand in the way of that. It is just not fair to them. They were hostages, just like the government workers were hostages. So I hope we can include that in these final hours of negotiations. It is very important.  Now, the only remaining obstacle to avoiding a government shutdown is the uncertainty of the President's signature. So I repeat my request: President Trump, say you will sign this bill. Remove the ax hanging over everyone's head. To make progress in our democracy, you have to accept the give-and-take. You have to accept some concessions. You have to be willing to compromise.  Any American President who says my way or no way does a real disservice to the American people. President Trump, in politics, to quote the Rolling Stones, ``You can't always get what you want.'' It is time to put the months of shutdown politics behind us. Mr. President, on another matter, today the Judiciary Committee is holding a confirmation hearing on the nomination of Mr. Michael Park for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers my home State of New York.  I have always assessed judges on three criteria: excellence, moderation, diversity. While Michael Park satisfies the first and third prongs of my test, he fails miserably on the second--modification.  Mr. Park has spent much of his career working in opposition to civil rights and seeking to advance the rightwing agenda that lies at the very core of the Federalist Society's mission. Mr. Park is currently working to defend the Trump administration's effort to insert a citizenship question into the 2020 census--a cynical effort to discourage people from responding to the census.  He has been on the frontlines of the effort to dismantle affirmative action policies in education. In 2012, he submitted an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, writing on behalf of the petitioner who sought to have the university's use of race, as one consideration among many, in the admissions process struck down as unconstitutional.  He is currently representing the plaintiffs in a suit challenging Harvard's affirmative action policy. He has worked to deny women's reproductive freedoms when he represented the State of Kansas against a challenge to its attempt to defund Planned Parenthood and ban it from participating in the State Medicaid Program.  In 2012, he submitted a brief to the Supreme Court in NFIB v. Sebelius urging the Court to strike down the entire Affordable Care Act. This nominee rather wants to get rid of the whole ACA.  If the American people knew the kind of nominees President Trump is nominating and the kind of nominees the Republican majority is supporting, so against everything they believe in--America believes in Roe v. Wade, America believes in keeping the ACA, America believes in voting rights--if they knew all these details, they would be appalled, and our Republican colleagues rarely bring these things to the floor legislatively. They know they would be roundly defeated, but it is sort of an end run--pick judges who in the courts will uphold these unpopular positions.  Mr. Park has a long and detailed record of support for the most conservative legal causes. A judge is asked to interpret the law rather than make the law, to apply fairly the legal principles set forth by precedent, not reread the Constitution to fit the political cause of the moment.  Mr. Park's career does not give me the confidence that he can be an impartial arbiter on the Second Circuit. I will oppose his nomination, and I will urge my colleagues to do the same.  Now, in the not-so-distant past, my objection to this nomination would mean that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee would not move forward with the nomination out of respect for home State Senators in the blue-slip tradition--but not in this Congress, not with this Republican majority.  Since the election of President Trump, Senate Republicans, led by Leader McConnell, Chairman Grassley, and now Chairman Graham, have unceremoniously discarded the blue-slip tradition. My colleagues on the other side will say it is because we haven't worked with them in a timely manner to fill these vacancies, but let's not kid ourselves. This is about one thing and one thing alone--the desire of the Republican majority to ram through more of the Federalist Society's handpicked, hard-right judges.  Last Congress, the majority confirmed two judges over the blue-slip objections of Democratic Senators Baldwin and Casey. A third, Ryan Bounds, would have been confirmed over the objections of Senators Wyden and Merkley if not for Senator Scott's principled objection to Bounds' past racist writings.  The practice continues, unfortunately, in this Congress. Last week, the Judiciary Committee voted along party lines to advance an additional four circuit court nominees over the blue-slip objections of five Democratic Senators--Brown, Murray, Cantwell, Booker, Menendez--and in the coming weeks, the committee will move forward with two additional court nominees over the objections of Ranking Member Feinstein and Senator Hatch.  Last Congress, we worked with the White House to move eight New York judges--one circuit, seven district--through the Judiciary Committee in a bipartisan way. That is how it should work. I would like to cooperate on New York judges this Congress, but the continued consideration of Michael Park, combined with the majority's clear intentions to ignore the blue-slip tradition, makes this very difficult, if not impossible. I know the leader is proud of what he is doing on judges. I don't think history will look very kindly on it; A, putting such hard-right judges, so against what the American people believe, in office. History will not look kindly on that as their decisions come down; but second, eliminating the last vestiges of bipartisanship as we select judges.  Mr. President, finally, the Senate will soon resume debate on the nomination of William Barr to be the Attorney General. I oppose this for many reasons, and later today I will join my Democratic colleagues during debate time to lay out my opposition to this nominee.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I thank the leader for his comments. I want to just say that the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee agree with him, and on their behalf, I would like to make the following comments.  Last week, the Judiciary Committee voted on the nomination of William Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. All Democrats voted against the nomination. There are reasons.  There is no question that Mr. Barr is qualified. He previously served as Attorney General from 1991 to 1993, and he has had a long legal career, but the question before us is whether Mr. Barr is the right choice to lead the Justice Department, at this time, with this President, when there are currently several active investigations that implicate this President, his campaign, his advisers, and/or his inner circle.  The answer for me and the Judiciary Committee Democrats is no. Let me explain why. Five months before being named for the Attorney General position, Mr. Barr wrote an extensive 19-page, single-spaced memo in which he provided great detail and legal arguments for his view of the President's absolute authority. Mr. Barr then shared and discussed that memo with the White House Counsel and the President's defense lawyers.  In this memo, Mr. Barr outlined his views on Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into possible obstruction of justice, the unitary executive, and whether a President can, in fact, be indicted.  One example, Mr. Barr argued that Special Counsel Mueller should not be allowed to question the President about obstruction of justice--point 1.  He concluded that the law does not apply to the President if it conflicts with a broad view of Executive authority, and that view is often referred to as the unitary executive.  Under this belief, conflict of interest laws cannot and do not apply to the President of the United States because, as Mr. Barr writes in his memo, ``to apply them would impermissibly `disempower' the President from supervising a class of cases that the Constitution grants him the authority to supervise. Under the Constitution, the President's authority over law enforcement matters is necessarily all-encompassing.''  Read the memo. This is on page 11.  Further, Mr. Barr asserted that ``the Constitution, itself, places no limit on the President's authority to act on matters which concern him or his own conduct.''  Mr. Barr went on to explain that, in his view, President Trump would have virtually unlimited authority over the Executive branch. As he said in his memo, the President ``alone is the Executive branch. As such, he is the sole repository of all Executive powers conferred by the Constitution. Thus, the full measure of law enforcement authority is placed in the President's hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds of cases subject to his control and supervision.''  That is page 11 of the memo.  Importantly, based on these conclusions, Mr. Barr asserts that certain Presidential actions--including firing FBI Director James Comey or telling the FBI to go easy on Michael Flynn--is never obstruction of justice.  In fact, Mr. Barr even said that ``the President's discretion in these areas has long been considered `absolute,' and his decisions exercising this discretion are presumed to be regular and are generally deemed nonreviewable.''  That is page 10 in the memo.  This is a stunning legal argument. Taken to its natural conclusion, Mr. Barr's analysis squarely places this President above the law. To argue that the President has no check on his authority flies in the face of our constitutional principles of checks and balances and should be concerning to Democrats and Republicans.  Mr. Barr's views about the power of the President are especially troubling in light of his refusal to commit to making the special counsel's findings and the report publicly available, and his refusal to agree to protect the other investigations into President Trump.  When I asked Mr. Barr about this at the hearing, he said, in his own words, that he would ``make as much information available as I can consistent with the rules and regulations that are part of the special counsel regulations.''  When others pressed him, he changed his answer to suggest that he may instead release a summary of the special counsel's findings. This is not acceptable. There is nothing in existing law or regulations that prevents the Attorney General from sharing the special counsel's report and underlying factual findings with the American public. Many of us believe this report is seminal to the Presidency, and the public must be able to read it.  In addition, as part of our oversight responsibilities, Congress routinely requests and receives confidential information related to closed investigations. In fact, recently Congress asked for and received investigative information, including transcripts of FBI interviews of witnesses involved in the examination of Secretary Clinton's emails. This matter should be treated no differently.  After Mr. Barr's hearing, I sent him two letters. First, I asked him to provide Congress and the American public with the full accounting of the Mueller investigation, including any report prepared by the special counsel himself.  Secondly, I asked him in writing to commit to protecting all investigations into matters surrounding President Trump and the 2016 election.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: I did not receive the courtesy of a response to either letter.  Here is a man seeking approval of his appointment. The ranking member of the Judiciary Committee sends him a letter asking two very valid questions, and there is no response. That told me something very loud and clear.  Over the past year, we have seen several other investigations arising out of the Southern District of New York, the Eastern District of Virginia, and the District of Columbia, where prosecutors are looking into crimes involving foreign donations into the Trump inauguration committee, money laundering, campaign finance violations, as well as possible efforts by Russian agents to assist the Trump campaign during the election. When asked about these investigations at his hearing, Mr. Barr refused to pledge they would be protected from interference. He refused to pledge that these valid investigations would be protected from interference.  For example, Senator Coons asked, ``If the President ordered you to stop the [Southern District of New York] investigation in which someone identified as individual one is implicated, would you do that?''  Mr. Barr responded that ``every decision within the department has to be made based on the attorney general's independent conclusion and assessment that it's in accordance with the law, so I would not stop a bona fide lawful investigation.''  However, this qualification of ``a bona fide, lawful investigation'' is all important. In his 19-page memo, Mr. Barr clearly wrote this: ``The full measure of law enforcement authority is placed in the President's hands, and no limit is placed on the kinds of cases subject to his control and supervision,'' including ``matters in which he has an interest.'' I really see why he was nominated. This is the offering of complete protection from the law by the Attorney General--future Attorney General, if he should become one.  Mr. Barr went on to argue that if the President determined ``an investigation was bogus, the President ultimately had legitimate grounds for exercising his supervisory powers to stop the matter.'' This would mean that the President could stop the Mueller investigation, which the President has repeatedly described as a ``witch hunt'' and ``hoax.''  It also means that if Donald Trump decided the Southern District of New York's investigation was, in Mr. Barr's words, ``bogus,'' the President would have the right to stop the investigation. Think about that. Think about the ramifications of that.  When Senator Blumenthal asked Mr. Barr during his hearing, ``If the President fired a United States attorney, would you support continuing that investigation, even under the civil servants, the career prosecutors, who would remain?''  Mr. Barr replied, ``Yeah . . . I believe, regardless of who or what outside the department is trying to influence what is going on, every decision within the department relating to enforcement, the attorney general has to determine independently that--that it is a lawful action.''  Think about that. The Attorney General becomes the arbiter, independently, of what a lawful action comprises. But, again, according to this memo, firing a U.S. attorney, even if it implicates the President's own personal interests, is a lawful action by the President.  During this hearing, Mr. Barr stated that ``the President can fire a U.S. attorney. They are a presidential appointment.''  The meaning of this is clear: Prosecutors in these cases can be fired arbitrarily by the President of the United States under his plenary authority.  As I said at the outset, the question is whether Mr. Barr is the right person for the job at this time. The memo that I am quoting from I spent a full day reading and thinking about, and it was the most extreme case for Presidential power that I have ever read. In and of itself, it gives me cause to believe this is why--I could be wrong, but this is why he received that nomination.  Given the broad implications of Presidential power and unlimited control Mr. Barr believes this President has over law enforcement matters, I cannot support this nominee to serve as Attorney General. At this critical time in our Nation's history, we must have an Attorney General who is objective and who is clearly committed to protecting the interests of the people, the country, and the Constitution.--not the President.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, we are doing a number of important things in the Senate this week.  Last night, we passed the Natural Resources Management Act. This is a bipartisan package of more than 100 individual bills that will help protect our natural resources, spur economic development, increase access to public lands, and much more.  I was very pleased that my Custer County Airport Conveyance Act, which I introduced with the other Members of the South Dakota delegation, was included in this bill. This legislation will give Custer County Airport full ownership of the land on which it operates and allow the airport to make improvements to its facilities.  Custer County Airport supports business and recreational aviation and fire suppression efforts in the Black Hills region, and I am pleased that this bill will increase the airport's ability to serve this area of South Dakota.  I am grateful to Chairman Murkowski for her leadership on this important lands package, as well as to Ranking Member Manchin and all of those who worked on these bills at the committee level. Mr. President, last night, the Senate moved forward on William Barr's nomination to be Attorney General. We will have the final vote on that nomination later this week.  The President made an outstanding choice with Mr. Barr. Mr. Barr is eminently qualified to be Attorney General. In fact, he has already been Attorney General--under President George H.W. Bush. He also served as Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice and as Deputy Attorney General.  He has won respect from both sides of the aisle. He has been confirmed by the Senate without opposition--not once, not twice, but three times. He was unanimously confirmed as Attorney General under George H.W. Bush in a Democrat-controlled Senate. Then-Judiciary Committee Chairman Joe Biden described him as ``a heck of an honorable guy.''  Senator Leahy also spoke at that time, expressing his belief that Mr. Barr would be ``an independent voice for all Americans.''  Today, Mr. Barr continues to earn respect from Democrats. The ranking member on the Judiciary Committee noted in January:       He's obviously very smart. He was attorney general before.      No one can say he isn't qualified. Mr. Barr is extremely smart and eminently qualified. He would be a judicious, thoughtful, and independent Attorney General, whose allegiance would be to, as he said, ``the rule of law, the Constitution, and the American people.'' I hope the Senate will quickly confirm him in a bipartisan fashion."

                "speech":"Mr. President, the final order of business this week is funding the government. I am very pleased and encouraged that Chairman Shelby and his counterparts have reached an agreement ``in principle'' to fully fund the government and fund important border security measures.  No one wants another government shutdown. I am very glad Democrats abandoned their efforts to force a cap on the number of individuals that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could detain in the interior of the country. If Democrats' enforcement cap had been adopted, Immigration and Customs Enforcement would have been forced to release criminals already in detention onto our Nation's streets. I am pleased that Democrats decided to separate themselves from the radical anti-border-security wing of their party. Instead, the deal will now give Immigration and Customs Enforcement the flexibility it needs to address surges of illegal immigration at our southern border.  I am also very glad Democrats moved from their insistence on zero funding for physical barriers at the border. Barriers are an essential element of border security, and I am pleased this compromise will allow 55 new miles of physical barriers in the Rio Grande Valley's sector, which is a high-priority area for the Border Patrol. That is double the number of new miles provided in fiscal year 2018 and nearly three times as many as would have been available under a continuing resolution.  I thank Chairman Shelby and Members of both parties who have been working on a funding and border security deal, as well as the staffers who have worked nights and weekends, to help develop this agreement. I look forward to reviewing the final language and voting on a final funding and border security package later this week.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I appreciate the bipartisan conversation that is going on with the chair, and I hope more of that will go on. That really is a little bit of why I rise today, because I hope and pray that if there--while we have many legitimate policy differences in this body, one thing we ought to have absolute, complete agreement on is that the United States of America cannot afford another government shutdown.  The last shutdown, which President Trump was so proud to initiate, cost our economy--and this is the lowest estimate we could find so we don't look like we are overstating--an estimated $6 billion.  The truth is, that number hardly reflects the human cost of this self-inflicted disaster our country was led into. A recent survey found that 62 percent of Federal workers depleted most or all of their emergency savings, 42 percent of Federal workers took on debt to pay bills or other expenses, and 25 percent tapped their retirement accounts. If you tap your IRA, you pay tax penalties, and you get none of that reimbursed.  Listen to this: 25 percent of our Federal workers who were the victims of this shutdown--25 percent of our Federal workers, during this shutdown, had to visit a food bank. If you work for the United States of America, the greatest Nation in the world, and you are asked to show up to work without pay, you should not have to visit a food bank.  I spent most of my career in the private sector, and I am proud of those activities, but I know very few folks who work for any of my companies who would have continued to show up day in and day out to do their jobs if they were going for 35 days without pay--and 35 days without pay where, frankly, you had some Members of the so-called board, the Congress, who showed no appreciation at all for their suffering and many who said they didn't mind if that shutdown continued indefinitely.  Those fellow Americans are Federal workers, contractors, private businesses that support Federal installations or the campground outside the Shenandoah National Park or the restaurant outside Petersburg National Battlefield--not just Federal employees, folks in the private sector as well endured tremendous hardship because the President decided to use their livelihoods as a bargaining chip. That can't happen again.  While I want to always try to be optimistic and appreciate the bipartisan agreement that has been reached by the budget negotiators, unfortunately, we find ourselves in the same spot right now--potentially just days away from another Trump shutdown.  The President said he is not happy, but he won't say whether he will sign the bipartisan deal that came from the conference committee. Let's be clear. The uncertainty itself is having a negative impact on the operation of the Federal Government and costing taxpayer dollars each and every day that this cloud hangs over the government. Agencies are already interrupting investigations and canceling trainings and meetings. They are being forced to act as if the government will once again be shut down at the end of this week. This is just plain mismanagement of government by the Trump administration. It is another example of the disrespect this White House has shown to our Federal workforce.  In Virginia, over the past few weeks, Senator Kaine and I have spent a lot of time listening to Federal workers. We heard from Federal workers who had to pull their kids out of daycare and send them away to relatives because they couldn't meet those daycare expenses if they weren't getting paid and folks who missed student loan payments or literally had to choose between their medications and paying rent. Now, these workers have started to receive some of their backpay, and many of them have not received all of their backpay from the shutdown.  The truth is, those Federal workers who drew down their savings or incurred a tax penalty from taking money from their IRA or who took an advance on their credit card are not made whole by receiving backpay because they have incurred penalties that will never be made up, beyond the psychic damage that is taking place with their families.  But even if we accept that most of the Federal workers will ultimately get their backpay, that is not the case for thousands of Federal contractors in Virginia and around the country. Quite honestly, the nightmare is not over.  The President's decision to finally reopen the government didn't magically undo 35 days of missed pay. Unfortunately, no one from the White House could be bothered to meet with any of these folks, whether it be Federal workers or contractors who were hurt by this government shutdown. If they had, they would know how much pain this President's shutdown continues to inflict on Federal contractors, particularly low- and middle-income workers. I spent the last couple of months, the last month and a half listening to these folks describe the anxiety of not knowing when their next paycheck will come or if it will come at all.  Sometimes when we think about Federal contractors, we think about high-priced folks, many of whom do a good job working for our government, many in my State. Sometimes that is the image of a Federal contractor. I wonder if most of the Members of this body realize that the people who clean the toilets at the Smithsonian or serve the food at the cafeteria in the Smithsonian are Federal contractors, and for the 35 days of the government shutdown--they have no recourse at this moment in time. They are struggling as we speak, and they will continue to struggle if Congress doesn't take advantage of this opportunity--if we get this deal signed by Friday and keep the government open--to make good on our commitment to those contractors as well. If we end up with the alternative and the government shuts down again, these folks' lives--at least their economic lives--will be in jeopardy. A number of small businesses--women-owned businesses, minority businesses, veteran-owned businesses--that tried, through this last 35-day shutdown, to keep their workers on payroll had to take that money out of their business pockets to try to make ends meet. But after a couple of weeks, a lot of them couldn't afford to do that. Those businesses have shut down. Years and in certain cases decades of work down the drain, not because they did something that was mismanagement, not because they did something that was irresponsible, not because they weren't providing the taxpayers with the full value of their work, but because we here in Congress and the White House couldn't come to a common agreement on the most basic responsibility of government, which is to keep the doors open and the lights on.  I held a roundtable recently with a contractor in Springfield, VA. A contractor there named Barbara told me she is behind on her rent and had to take her granddaughter out of daycare because she can't pay the bills. Now, she is glad she is back at work, but that 35 days with no pay--unless we rectify that with this deal that may come to pass before the weekend, she is still left in the cold. Another at that same roundtable told me she had to choose between food and medicine.  A couple of weeks ago, I met a contractor named John, an Afghanistan veteran, who was picking up groceries at the food bank in Arlington because the shutdown wiped out his savings. We had some press, but John didn't want to go on camera. He was a little bit embarrassed that he had to pick up food at the food bank. This is someone who is a veteran. This is someone who continued to serve in terms of protecting the country. Thirty-five days without pay. With the status quo--he will never get those lost earnings back if we don't rectify that this week.  Another contractor named Joseph, who works as a custodian at the Department of the Interior, told me this:       We work just as hard as anyone else. We need our backpay so      we can catch up on our bills and survive.  The remarkable thing is, for some of these janitors and custodial workers, on buildings that were open, they had to continue to work and still don't get backpay.  One of the most heartbreaking things was listening to these contractors talk about the shame--the shame of being treated as if their work does not have value. The truth is, these folks take pride in their work because they love their country. That same contractor, Joseph, says he thinks of the building he cleans as the President's house, and he works hard because he wants to make it shine every day. What a disgrace that this government can't even honor his service with back wages so that he can pay his bills and get his personal finances in order.  Many other contractors take pride in their work because it represents their independence. Over 45,000 disabled Americans work as Federal contractors through the AbilityOne Program. I know this program is very successful in Delaware. The Senator from Delaware will speak on it shortly.  I have met contractors who are double amputees, veterans with PTSD, and folks with physical and intellectual disabilities. They are able to live normal lives and contribute to society because of these Federal contractor jobs. For many of them, these jobs are more than about pay. It is about respect. It is about being valued and part of a community, part of a team at the offices they work in. They suffer more than just about anyone when their lifeline--that source of income, independence, and dignity--is cut off because of a government shutdown.  I will close with something a Federal contractor named Constance told me last week. Even though she and her team of custodians still face tremendous financial hardship, she told me that she remains hopeful. She is hopeful because she and her coworkers are now back to work, and she is hopeful because people in this Chamber are finally starting to listen to folks like her.  I share her hope that the Senate will have the decency and the basic humanity to make sure, one, that we don't close down this government come Friday, and two, that when we come to this deal, we take that moment--and I see colleagues from both sides of the aisle. We have gotten the CBO score. It is scored to make sure the backpay for the contractors, with an emphasis toward low-income contractors, under $50,000--the cost would be at $1 billion. That is the CBO score. We ought to make sure that these people's lives--that the work they do is valued.  I hope, as we have this bipartisan deal to avoid the shutdown, that we can also make it right for the folks who oftentimes many of us don't see--who clean the buildings, serve the food, many folks from the disabled community--who rely upon us to do the right thing.  Congress should pass this backpay for Federal contractors legislation. The President should sign it, and if the President doesn't, the Congress should override his veto.  Let's make sure, as we did with Federal workers, that they will always be assured that they will get their backpay. Let's make sure that contractors get that same decency. It is time to do the right thing.  With that, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to offer briefly my remarks on the nomination of William Barr to serve as Attorney General of the United States.  This past Thursday, when the Judiciary Committee of the Senate considered him, I was absent, being the cochair of the National Prayer Breakfast. I would like to offer my conclusions briefly here on the floor.  I have weighed carefully over several weeks William Barr's nomination to serve as the next Attorney General. Initially, I have to say, I was greatly encouraged that the President nominated a nominee whose service had included leadership roles in the Justice Department, including Attorney General of the United States.  However, I believe my responsibility to assess Mr. Barr's candidacy requires me to consider his entire record, including his recent writings, his statements, and his work, and to focus on his ability to actually meet the test of our current time. Having met with him in person, having questioned him during the Judiciary Committee's confirmation hearing, having reviewed his record, and having reviewed his written answers to questions submitted for the record, I ultimately believe Mr. Barr does not meet this test. I am not confident that he will uphold the Attorney General's critical role in defending the Department of Justice as an institution and in ensuring that the special counsel's investigation proceeds with independence and, by so doing, restores the trust of the American people in the rule of law.  In weighing his nomination, the memo Mr. Barr chose to author in June 2018--and to submit--criticizing the special counsel's investigation into obstruction of justice, I concluded was significant and could not be ignored. Mr. Barr tried to narrow or minimize the import of this memo by saying it was a specific application to a particular statute. The fact remains that his memo is rooted in and embraces an exceptionally broad theory of executive power that could threaten not only the special counsel's investigation but a lot of our current understanding of the scope and reach of Executive power.  When I asked him if he had sent other lengthy, detailed legal memos he had researched and written himself to the Department of Justice as a private citizen, he could only cite that one memo from this year, dealing critically with the special counsel's investigation.  At his nomination hearing in the committee, I sought simple and concrete assurances from Mr. Barr that he would give the special counsel's ongoing investigation the independence and separation from partisan politics it needs and deserves. In some instances I was genuinely encouraged by his answers. I was glad to hear a forceful answer from Mr. Barr that he would not fire the special counsel without cause and would resign rather than do so, if so ordered.  On other issues, however, he failed to give the sort of simple and clear commitment that former Attorney General Elliot Richardson gave at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee during the period of an important investigation in the 1970s. Mr. Barr would not commit to following the guidance of career DOJ ethics officials on whether he should recuse himself. He would not commit to deferring to special counsel Mueller's investigative decisions. Finally, he would not commit to making special counsel Mueller's final report public. In essence, Mr. Barr is asking the American people and those of us who represent them to trust him to do the right thing. There are reasons to believe that he will, but there are, as I have laid out briefly, reasons to be gravely concerned that he will not.  Something my predecessor here in the Senate, Senator Joe Biden, expressed in voting to confirm him back in 1991, was his grave concerns about his expansive view of Executive power, but that was a very different time in our history, with a different Court and a different context.  I think we must be clear-eyed about the moment our country faces and the Attorney General's potentially pivotal role in ensuring the integrity of the rule of law and the institutions of our democracy. I believe it is my responsibility in the Senate to protect the special counsel investigation, to ensure that other ongoing Federal investigations are not interfered with because of a narrow or partisan purpose, and to safeguard the rule of law.  If Mr. Barr is confirmed, I hope he will prove me wrong. I hope he will demonstrate to the American people of all parties and backgrounds that he will put the interests of our democracy above the moment and partisan priorities. I hope he will prove to be a terrific, solid, and reliable steward for the ongoing investigation Special Counsel Mueller is leading into Russian interference in the 2016 election. If so, I will gladly put aside our policy differences to work with him for the good of the American people during this critical time, but I regret I have reached the conclusion that I cannot support his nomination this week.  Thank you, Mr. President.  With that, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, on Monday, I was in El Paso, TX, to talk with some of my constituents about the challenges that exist along our southwest border and how we can work together to address them.  It is almost surreal to have people here in Washington, DC, who have never been to the border and whose, perhaps, only supposed knowledge is from novels they have read or movies they have seen. Having spent quite a bit of time along the border of Texas and Mexico, myself, I can tell you it is a unique part of our country and certainly a unique part of my State.  The people you learn the most from are not the elected officials who serve here in Washington but rather from the Border Patrol, the sheriffs, the mayors, and countless others who live and work along the border. They can provide, I think, the kind of expert knowledge that we need in order to address the challenges that exist.  What they tell me and what I have learned is that there is no one-size-fits-all, because you can look at urban environments, like El Paso, or you can go out to Big Bend, which has thousands-of-feet-high cliffs overlooking the Rio Grande. Obviously, a physical barrier in one place, like in highly trafficked urban areas, is one situation, but putting it atop a 3,000-foot cliff is another. So no one-size-fits-all solution works.  That is why it is important to listen to the stakeholders who live and work in these communities, and this is key to actually doing something with the feedback they provide. What I have constantly been reminded of is that border security is a combination of three parts: physical barriers in some hard-to-control locations, personnel, and technology. What is best for a high-trafficked urban area, as I said, is probably much different than what is good for the vast expanses between the ports of entry. Figuring out what we need or where we need it is not a decision that ought to be micromanaged in Washington. It should come from the experts who know the threats and challenges along every mile of the border.  While I was in El Paso, we also talked--as we must--about the important role the border plays with our economy. Border communities in Texas depend on people and goods moving legally through our ports.  For example, in Laredo, TX, alone, about 14,000 trucks pass each day through the ports of entry. It is one of the largest if not the largest land-based port in the United States. These goods need to move legally through our ports, and any disruption in legitimate international commerce can have a swift impact on these communities.  For the people of El Paso, for example, border security means much more than just safety. It means economic security as well. Just as it is important to keep the bad actors out, it is equally important to promote efficient transit through our ports for legitimate trade and commerce.  On Monday, I also had a chance to reconnect with my friend Mayor Dee Margo, the Mayor of El Paso. Among other things, we talked about the importance of ensuring that in our efforts to create a strong border, we are not neglecting our ports of entry.  In recent months, a number of El Paso Sector Customs officers have been sent to other high-need areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. The personnel shortage has resulted in increased wait times for both pedestrian traffic and commerce. Certainly, fewer CBP agents mean a reduced vigilance in terms of screening out contraband and other things that we don't want coming into the country. The goods moving through the ports in El Paso fuel not just the local economy, as I said, but also that of the entire State of Texas--and, I would argue, of the Nation. I share the mayor's concerns on the harmful impact these slowdowns at the ports of entry can have.  As we debate the importance of securing our borders to stop the illegal movement of people and goods, we shouldn't neglect the importance of facilitating legal movement through our ports. We need to do both, whether that means providing additional funding for infrastructure improvements or scanning technology to make sure the ports of entry aren't exploited by drugs in vehicles or other places where they are hard to find. In the absence of scanning technology, if we are unable to find them, the cartels win, and the American people lose. We also know that in addition to that technology, we need additional personnel.  I hope my colleagues listen to the feedback that we have all gotten from the experts and these local stakeholders and take seriously the economic impact on our ports of entry as well.  As I said yesterday, I look forward to reviewing the details of the funding agreement struck by the conference committee, and I hope that, in addition to physical barriers where appropriate, it reflects these principles of smart border security, because when we listen to the experts--the law enforcement officials who work along the border and in the communities--that is when we move in the right direction, spending money in a responsible and smart way rather than just pursuing political agendas from Washington."

                "speech":" Mr. President, we are also going to be voting--perhaps today, maybe tomorrow--on the nomination of William Barr to serve as the next Attorney General of the United States. The role of Attorney General is unique in the President's Cabinet because while you are a political appointee of the President, you are also the Nation's chief law enforcement officer and, obviously, are obligated to put your highest loyalty in upholding the rule of law.  I asked Mr. Barr about this unique role during his confirmation hearing. He told me that over the years he has received a number of calls from people who were being considered for appointment to the position of Attorney General. He told them that if they wanted to pursue any political future, they would be crazy to accept the job of Attorney General. He said: ``If you take this job, you have to be ready to make decisions and spend all your political capital and have no future because you have to have that freedom of action.'' He assured me that he is in a position now in his life where he can do what he needs to do without fear of any consequences.  I was glad to hear that because I believe that is the most fundamental quality of an Attorney General. The Department of Justice must be able to operate above the political fray and prioritize the rule of law above all else, and to do that it needs a strong and principled leader like Bill Barr--particularly, on the heels of Loretta Lynch's and Eric Holder's administrations as Attorneys General of the United States during the Obama term of office, where we know that, unfortunately, politics pervaded the actions not only of the Department of Justice but also the FBI in things ranging from the Hillary Clinton email investigation to the counterintelligence investigation of some of the people associated with the Trump campaign.  Of course, this isn't the only reason he is the right person for the job. We know that he can faithfully execute the duties of the office because he has done it before.  More than two decades ago, President George Herbert Walker Bush recognized the talent in this promising young attorney and nominated him to three increasingly important positions in the Department of Justice. For all three positions, Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel, Deputy Attorney General, and, finally, Attorney General, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. I would hope that he would be unanimously confirmed as Attorney General once again, but I have my doubts.  After hearing Mr. Barr speak about his views of the role of Attorney General, I have no question as to why not a single Senator opposed his nomination during those three previous confirmation votes. He spoke of the importance of acting with professionalism and integrity, of ensuring that the character of the Department of Justice is maintained and can withstand even the most trying political times, and of serving with independence, providing no promises or assurances to anyone on anything other than faithfully administering the rule of law.  When Mr. Barr was nominated for Attorney General the first time, then-Judiciary Chairman Joe Biden noted that Mr. Barr, a nominee from the opposing political party, would be a ``fine Attorney General.'' I agree, and I thank Mr. Barr for agreeing to serve, once again, this country in this critical position. I look forward to voting yes on his nomination.  I would just add that I am saddened by the way the politics of the moment--the desire to defeat any legislation or oppose any nominee by this President--has led some of our colleagues across the aisle to oppose this nomination. I don't know whether it is out of fear of the most radical fringe of their political party or by their antipathy for this President, but it is regrettable.  I do believe, however, that Mr. Barr will be confirmed, as he should be, as the next Attorney General of the United States. I look forward to casting a ``yes'' vote on that nomination."

                "speech":"Mr. President, once again, I would like to respond to the Senator from Texas as he continues to hold the position that the Democrats on this side of the aisle simply oppose all of the President's nominees because they happen to be this lying President's nominees. That is not the case at all.  Donald Trump has consistently thought to nominate people to his Cabinet who he believes will do his bidding and protect his interests. Once confirmed, if these Cabinet Secretaries displease him, out they go--Jeff Sessions, Jim Mattis, Rex Tillerson.  The President believes William Barr will be an Attorney General who will protect him. Why does the President believe that? Because William Barr auditioned for this position. How? Mr. Barr wrote a highly unusual and factually unsupported, unsolicited 19-page memo to the Sessions Justice Department, arguing that Special Counsel Robert Mueller should not be permitted to interrogate the President about obstruction of justice. Nobody asked him to weigh in.  He admits he didn't have any facts or inside information, and, in fact, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein chose not to discuss the matter with him, but Mr. Barr felt compelled not only to put his views in writing and send them to the Department of Justice, but he also made sure the President's lawyers knew his views. His memo sent a clear message to this President that he would protect Donald Trump from the Mueller probe.  Once Donald Trump did nominate him for Attorney General, after having earlier offered him a job as his personal attorney--virtually the same job in Donald Trump's mind--Mr. Barr came to the Judiciary Committee and continued to signal his willingness to shield Trump from scrutiny.  First, he refused to commit to follow the advice of career ethics officials on the question of recusal from the Trump investigations. He didn't want to make the same mistake Jeff Sessions did and open himself up to Presidential humiliation, no matter what the ethics experts recommended.  Second, he refused to commit to make public Special Counsel Mueller's report. In both instances, he said he wanted to keep his options open, leave himself room to make his own decisions, and trust his ultimate judgment.  While these answers were reassuring to the President, they certainly were not to those of us who want an Attorney General independent of a President who does not believe the rule of law applies to him. When asked at his hearing, Mr. Barr should have affirmatively committed to allowing all active investigations to continue until the prosecutors say they are done. That includes the special counsel's investigation, as well as the probes being conducted by, again, at least three U.S. attorney's offices. Instead, he gave his usual equivocal response.  Of course, these are all active investigations having to do with Mr. Trump and his activities. Barr's position on these investigations is consistent with his views on the unitary Executive. He has long endorsed a view that the President is an all-powerful Executive, restrained by very little, least of all by Congress. This is a very dangerous view for the Attorney General to have, especially at a time when we have a President who attacks and undermines the rule of law.  Mr. Barr's views on the Trump investigations and the unitary Executive aren't the only reason he should not be confirmed as Attorney General. His agreement with this administration's immigration policy also, in my view, disqualifies him. There was no daylight between Donald Trump and Jeff Sessions on immigration. Mr. Barr has given every indication that he will follow the lead of Jeff Sessions and of Matthew Whitaker in aggressively implementing, basically, Stephen Miller's extreme immigration policies.  As George H.W. Bush's Attorney General, Barr played a key role in the Justice Department's policy in the early 1990s of detaining HIV-positive Haitian refugees at Guantanamo Bay. These refugees were held in prison-like living conditions and denied medical treatment until a Federal court ruled that their indefinite detention was illegal.  More recently, in November 2018, Mr. Barr cowrote an op-ed with the title ``We Salute Jeff Sessions,'' full of praise for Sessions' tenure at DOJ, including on immigration. Mr. Barr praised Sessions for ``attack[ing] the rampant illegality that riddled our immigration system, breaking the record for prosecution of illegal-entry cases,'' and increasing prosecution of ``immigrants who reentered the country illegally'' by 38 percent.  These statements are deeply concerning because as Attorney General, Mr. Sessions implemented policies that are abhorrent and in direct opposition to American values.  Sessions instituted the zero-tolerance policy--a stain on our Nation that resulted in thousands of children being separated from their families, many of whom may never be reunited. This country, under Jeff Sessions, made instant orphans out of thousands of children. That is hardly a value that I think any of us can support.  At his hearing, Mr. Barr also embraced key aspects of the Trump-Miller immigration agenda, including endorsing Donald Trump's vanity wall; attacking cities that refused to undermine their own anti-crime efforts by cooperating with the Federal Government's draconian policies; agreeing with the Trump administration's atrocious treatment of legal asylum seekers; joining President Trump in criticizing judges for blocking the President's Muslim travel ban; and astoundingly, refusing to say whether birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the Constitution, telling me, when I asked him this, that he hadn't ``looked at that legally.'' What is there to look at? The Fourteenth Amendment plainly states that all persons ``born or naturalized in the United States . . . are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.'' Nullifying birthright citizenship would violate the Constitution and impact millions, but it is certainly something the President wants done.  Mr. Barr's record and position on some of DOJ's other important responsibilities, such as enforcing civil rights laws, defending laws enacted by Congress, and protecting established constitutional rights, are unacceptable to me in the Nation's top law enforcement officer.  Some examples include: Mr. Barr's refusal to admit that voter fraud is incredibly rare and his focusing on so-called voter fraud problems rather than voter suppression problems. States are very busy continuing to pass laws that should be attacked as a silly veiled effort at voter suppression, but that is not where Mr. Barr is; his stand that LGBTQ people are not protected from employment discrimination under Federal civil rights laws, contrary to what the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and two Federal courts have held; his personal involvement in two challenges to major premises of the Affordable Care Act; his record of belief that Roe v. Wade was wrongly decided, including his statement that this landmark Supreme Court case guaranteeing a woman's right to choose, as he put it, was a ``secularist'' effort to ``eliminate laws that reflect traditional norms.'' At a time when the newest Trump-appointed Justices on the Supreme Court have demonstrated a hostility toward a woman's constitutional right to an abortion, such an anti-choice Attorney General is a danger to women.  In some of his academic writings, William Barr expressed his dismay at the moral decay of American society, but when I asked him at his hearing, he testified that he didn't have any problems with a President who lies every single day and has undermined so many of America's most important institutions such as the FBI, the Justice Department, and the intelligence community.  An Attorney General is a member of the President's Cabinet and is entitled to enforce the administration's policies, but in this instance, the policies this President pursues are often pushed beyond the constitutional breaking point and just as often are plain cruel; i.e., the separation of children from their parents at the border, making them instant orphans.  The Attorney General's independence is critical in normal times, but it is absolutely essential in these times that are anything but normal that his independence cannot be questioned. Sadly, I cannot say that.  I cannot support William Barr's nomination. I urge my colleagues to vote against his confirmation.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise to speak about the nomination of William Barr to be the next Attorney General of the United States.  Mr. Barr has an admirable record of public service in his career. He has dramatically more qualifications and experience than many of his predecessors and, certainly, the Acting Attorney General. We can see he brings more experience to the job.  I respect Mr. Barr and his family. I have told him as much to his face. He has a wonderful family, and he brought them with him to the hearing, and many of them have chosen public service careers, as he has.  I carefully reviewed his record, trying to consider him in not only the context of this awesome responsibility of being Attorney General, but at this awesome moment in history.  When it comes to the ongoing investigation of President Trump's campaign by Robert Mueller, I fear that Mr. Barr has said and done things that raise questions about his objectivity. He has clearly indicated to President Donald Trump and to all of us how he would oversee this investigation if he is confirmed. Just look at the unsolicited--unsolicited--19-page memo that William Barr sent to Special Counsel Mueller's supervisors and to the Trump legal defense team just in June of 2018.  It is notable that Mr. Barr did not send this memo to Special Counsel Mueller himself, and he did not make it public.  This was the only time Mr. Barr had sent a memo like this to the Justice Department, and he did not disclose in his memo that he had personally interviewed with the President the previous year about serving on the President's defense team.  This memo is critical for its substance. In it, Mr. Barr argued that Bob Mueller, the investigator, the special counsel, should not be permitted to ask the President any questions about obstruction of justice, even though Mr. Barr's analysis focused only on one narrow obstruction theory.  The memo calls into serious question Mr. Barr's ability to impartially oversee the obstruction of justice issues in the Mueller investigation at a moment in history when that is an essential question. Mr. Barr has made no commitment to recuse himself from such questions. That is worrisome.  That William Barr would volunteer a 19-page legal memo with dramatic efforts at research and verification, give this to the President's defense team and to Mr. Mueller's supervisors at the Department of Justice, and basically make arguments diminishing the authority of the special counsel to move forward in the investigation raises a serious question about his impartiality.  Just as important, I am alarmed by Mr. Barr's continued hedging about what he will do when Mr. Mueller completes his investigation and has a presentation of his conclusions, his evidence, and his findings.  Make no mistake. Special Counsel Mueller's findings and conclusions should be shared with the American people and with the U.S. Congress. Current Department of Justice regulations and policies allow for such a release. I am concerned that Mr. Barr will exercise his discretion under those regulations narrowly and issue a cursory report that does not take the findings of the Mueller investigation in their entirety and make them available to the American people. This investigation is too critical to seal its result in some vault at the Department of Justice.  I believe we can trust Bob Mueller to be impartial and unbiased. I don't know if he will find the President or people around him guilty of wrongdoing beyond the indictments and convictions that have already come down or whether he will conclude that there is no further responsibility or culpability, but I trust his findings, whatever they are. He is a true professional.  It is important, after we have gone through a year or two of investigation, that the American people hear the details, hear the information that may be part of the Mueller investigation.  I am also concerned that Mr. Barr will continue his predecessor's harsh approach on immigration instead of charting a different course.  It was just last year, I believe in April in 2018, when the Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced something called the zero-tolerance policy.  Do you remember it?  The zero-tolerance policy said that the U.S. Government would forcibly remove infants, toddlers, and children from their parents at our border.  The inspector general's reports say that it had been going on for a year before it was publicly announced.  Twenty-eight hundred children were removed from their parents. What happened to them next is shameful. There was no effort made to trace these children and the parents who were forced to give them up.  It was only when a Federal judge in San Diego stepped forward and required the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Health and Human Services to make an accounting of how many children were still not united with their parents that they took the effort to do so months--months--after those children had been separated from their parents. I saw those kids in an immigration court in Chicago in a large office building that you would never guess was a court building in the Loop in Chicago. There it was, the immigration court taking up most of one floor in this office building. People were stacked three and four deep in the corridors, waiting for their hearing. But the judge--and she was a good person, a real professional--couldn't get her hearing underway. She had a problem with those who were appearing before her court that day. The problem was this: She had said that before they could start the proceeding, those who were appearing had to sit down. One of the clients who was in there for a hearing that day had some difficulty. I was there to witness it. The difficulty was she was 2 years old. She wasn't tall enough to crawl up in that chair without somebody lifting her.  The other client who had a hearing that day, who had been removed under this zero-tolerance policy, was a little more skillful. He spotted a Matchbox car on the top of the table, and this 4-year-old boy got up in the chair to play with it.  Those were two of the clients before this immigration judge in this office building in the Loop in Chicago. They had been forcibly removed from their parents, and they were up for a hearing. It was in August.  As a result of the hearing, as with most of the hearings, they said: We are going to postpone this until we get further evidence. The next hearing will be in December--December.  I would ask any parent, any grandparent: What would you think about being separated from that little girl, that 2-year-old girl, whom you love so much, for 6 months, 8 months, 9 months?  That was the policy of this Trump administration with zero tolerance--a policy created and announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  So when I asked Mr. Barr: You are going to take over this job. What is your view on this type of policy? Sadly, I didn't get a direct answer.  I am concerned that in many respects Mr. Barr could continue the harsh approach to immigration that we have seen by the Trump administration instead of charting a different course, a course more consistent with America's values and history.  We are in fact a nation of immigrants. Throughout American history, immigration has strengthened and renewed our country. I stand here today, the son of an immigrant girl who came to this country from Lithuania at the age of 2. Her son grew up and got a full-time government job right here in the Senate. It can happen. It is my story. It is my family's story. It is America's story.  When I listened to the diatribes by this President in the State of the Union Address about immigrants coming to this country--of course there are bad people. We don't want any of them in this country, and if they are here, we want them to leave. But think of all of the good people who have come to this country and made America what it is today. The President dismisses those folks, doesn't take them as seriously as he should, as far as I am concerned.  I want to know if this Attorney General, Mr. Barr, subscribes to the President's theories on immigration. For the past 2 years, President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions did everything in their power to make America's immigration policy harsh and unwelcoming.  Mr. Barr's comments and history make me fear that he will bring the full weight of the Justice Department to advance the President's anti-immigration agenda. Mr. Barr has refused to disavow the cruel and un-American zero-tolerance policy, which I just described, that led to thousands of children being forcibly removed from their parents, and he has fully and repeatedly echoed President Trump's call for a border wall after the debate we have been through over the last several months, falsely arguing that it will help to combat the opioid epidemic. That is a ludicrous argument. In fact, the Drug Enforcement Administration, which Mr. Barr would supervise, has found that the vast majority of deadly narcotics coming into America through the Mexican border are coming in through ports of entry. They are not being carried in backpacks by people scaling fences. That is where our security efforts should be made, not with some medieval wall.  Mr. Barr also falsely and repeatedly was critical of our asylum laws for a host of problems. Our asylum laws, which have historically had broad bipartisan support until this President came along, simply ensure that we honor our legal and moral obligation to provide safe haven to families and children who are fleeing persecution.  Who are these families seeking asylum and refugee status in the United States? You can find members of those families right here on the floor of the United States Senate. You can find three Cuban-American U.S. Senators--one Democrat and two Republicans--whose families came here as refugees from Castro's Cuba. Are we having second thoughts now about whether they are a valuable part of America? I am not. These people, these Cuban-Americans, have become an integral part of our Nation. They were once refugees and asylees. Now, they are party of America's future, and we are better off for it.  I could tell that story so many different ways. Soviet Jews trying to escape persecution in the old Soviet Union and the Vietnamese who stood by us and fought by our men and women in uniform during the Vietnam war, who had to escape an oppressive regime, came to the United States as refugees and asylees. We are now seeing under President Trump the lowest level of refugees in modern memory. We are walking away from our obligation to the world.  And Mr. Barr called for withholding of Federal funds to force cities to cooperate with the Trump administration's immigration agenda, even though courts have repeatedly struck down that approach.  Perhaps most troubling is Mr. Barr's comment to me that he thinks it is absolutely appropriate for the Attorney General to change the immigration rules to help advance a President's campaign. He said he did it to help the campaign of President Bush in 1992. The idea of an Attorney General letting campaign politics drive immigration enforcement is unacceptable regardless of the President.  I am also concerned with the views Mr. Barr expressed on something known as the unitary executive theory and his expansive view of Presidential power. He put it bluntly in that 19-page memo I mentioned before, when he said the President alone is the executive branch. We need an Attorney General who recognizes the need for checks and balances, but he did not believe that this President should be held accountable for many of the actions he has taken. I may be naive, but I don't believe any American is above the law, including the President of the United States.  This is not an ordinary time in the history of the Justice Department. President Trump has criticized the Judiciary, individual Federal judges, our intelligence Agencies, and the Department of Justice when they continued an investigation into his campaign. He has undermined their independence and integrity with his storm of tweets every single day.  William Barr said he sees the Attorney General as ``the President's lawyer''--in his words--but the chief law enforcement officer of the United States is supposed to be the lawyer for the people of the United States. We need an Attorney General who will lead the Justice Department without fear or favor and who will serve the Constitution of the American people even if it means standing up to a President.  If he is confirmed, I hope Mr. Barr will prove me wrong and that he will be a good Attorney General who came at the right moment in history, but I have not received the reassurances I was looking for from him to give him a vote to reach that position. I will be voting no on the Barr nomination.  I see my colleague and friend Senator Leahy on the floor. I will withhold two other statements for the Record to yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from Illinois, the senior Senator from Illinois, for his comments. He knows what it is to have immigrants in your family, as do I. I was fortunate to have a little more understanding as my paternal grandparents immigrated to Vermont from Italy, and my wife's parents immigrated to Vermont from French-speaking Canada. I still struggle with the Italian I knew as a child. I have done a little better with French, in order to speak to Marcelle's family. But I see the diversity that came of it. I see it in our State of Vermont, and I hope our country is better for it. So I thank the Senator from Illinois.  The last time William Barr was before the Senate was 28 years ago, during the George H.W. Bush administration, and I voted for him to be Attorney General. I did so despite having some reservations that I shared with him and the Senate at the time. Mr. Barr and I did not see eye to eye on many issues. We did not then, and we do not now. But he was clearly qualified for the position, and he had earned the confidence of the Senate. So I felt free to vote for him.  I am concerned by some of the remarks that Senator Durbin has referred to which seem to indicate that Mr. Barr may feel that he is the lawyer for the President, not only the Attorney General of the United States. He is there to represent everybody--everybody--and to make sure the laws are upheld for everybody.  Now we find ourselves considering his nomination under extraordinarily different circumstances than we did when my friend President Bush had nominated him. Multiple criminal investigations loom over the Trump Presidency. In fact, these investigations may ultimately define the Trump Presidency, and the President has reacted to it with apparently the only way he knows how. He just attacks relentlessly. He doesn't respond to them, but attacks. That includes attacking investigators, witnesses, even the justice system itself. That also includes firing both the FBI Director and his previous Attorney General for not handling one of the investigations as the President wanted, but instead as the law required.  The President views the Justice Department as an extension of his power. He has repeatedly called on it to target his political opponents. He has even reportedly told his advisers that he expects the Attorney General to protect him personally. I have been here with eight Presidents. I have never known a President, either Republican or Democrat, to have such an outrageous and wrong--wrong--view of the Department of Justice.  The integrity of the Justice Department has not been so tested since the dark days of Watergate. Yet when the Judiciary Committee considered the nomination of Elliot Richardson to be Attorney General in the midst of that national crisis, nominated by Richard Nixon, the nominee made numerous, detailed commitments to the committee. Mr. Richardson did so, in his words, to ``create the maximum possible degree of public confidence in the integrity of the process.'' That same principle applies equally today.  Indeed, that may be the only way the Justice Department escapes the Trump administration with its integrity intact. In large part due to the relentless politicizing of the Department by the President, millions of Americans will see bias no matter which way the Department resolves the Russia investigation. Because of seeing such bias, our country is diminished. The justice system is greatly diminished. In my view, the Department has only one way out--transparency. The American people deserve to know the facts, whatever they may be. That requires the special counsel's report, and the evidence that supports it, be made public.  Unfortunately, despite efforts from both Republicans and Democrats in the Senate, Mr. Barr has repeatedly refused to make that commitment. Worse, much of his testimony before the Judiciary Committee left us with more doubts. Will Mr. Barr allow President Trump to make a sweeping, unprecedented claim of Executive privilege that allows him to hide the report? Will Mr. Barr, relying on a Department policy to avoid disparaging uncharged parties, not disclose potential misconduct by the President simply due to another policy to not indict sitting Presidents? We don't know the answer, but we do know that Mr. Barr's testimony on these issues could lay the groundwork for potentially no transparency at all.  Mr. Barr also repeatedly refused to follow the precedent of Attorney General Jeff Sessions and commit to follow the advice of career ethics officials on whether he needs to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. He even declined my request to commit to simply sharing their recommendation with the Judiciary Committee. That is critical because there is reason to question whether an appearance of a conflict exists.  Prior to his nomination, Mr. Barr made his unorthodox views on the special counsel's obstruction of justice investigation very clear. He did that with a 19-page memo sent directly to the President's lawyers. Mr. Barr spoke dismissively about the broader Russia investigation. He even claimed that a conspiracy theory involving Hillary Clinton was far more deserving of a Federal investigation than possible collusion, and this was notwithstanding the fact that, by that time, that conspiracy had been debunked. He was asked, in effect, whether this memo was a job application, because it is difficult to imagine that these views escaped the attention of the President. That makes it all the more critical that Mr. Barr follow the precedent of prior Attorneys General and commit to following the advice of career ethics officials on recusal.  I am also concerned that, if confirmed, Mr. Barr would defend policies that I believe are both ineffective and inhumane. We heard Senator Durbin speak eloquently about the horrible, horrible program of separating families at the border, and I think the Nation is still reeling from that systematic separation. But, in light of that, Mr. Barr praised Jeff Sessions for ``breaking the record for prosecution'' of the misdemeanor offenses that forced families to be separated. In other words, on a misdemeanor, you take the child away from the parents and separate them. Nobody seems to know where everybody goes after that.  Ask a 4-year-old: What are your parents' name? They will say, in whatever language: Mommy and daddy.  Where do you live?  We live in the house next to so-and-so.  They don't know the addresses. They rely on their parents, and now they have been separated from them.  It makes me think Attorneys General should be able to stand up for the rule of law. I remember a time when former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates stood up for the rule of law. She refused to defend President Trump's first iteration of his Muslim ban as a deeply flawed order. It was stained with racial animus, that even applied to individuals who were lawful permanent residents and had valid visas, Mr. Barr described Ms. Yates's decision as ``obstruction'' and a ``serious abuse of office.''  My God, this country should not have religious tests. If we did, my grandparents would not have been able to come to this country.  Relevant to each of my concerns is Mr. Barr's extremely broad views of executive power. He is an advocate of the unitary executive theory, believing that the Constitution vests nearly all executive power ``in one and one only person--the President.'' He has said that an Attorney General has ``no authority and no conceivable justification for directing the department's lawyers not to advocate the president's position in court.'' This expansive view of a President's power would concern me no matter whose administration it was. In fact, if you go way back in history, it conflicts with Supreme Court Justice James Iredell's observation in 1792 that the Attorney General ``is not called the Attorney General of the President, but Attorney General of the United States.''  I find Mr. Barr's deferential view of Executive power especially concerning. We already know much of what President Trump intends to do. It includes taking billions of dollars that Congress has already appropriated and diverting it toward a wasteful and ineffective vanity wall. What would Mr. Barr do when confronted with such an order? He has essentially told us: Mr. Barr has argued that Congress's appropriations power provided under Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution is ``not an independent source of congressional power'' to ``control the allocation of government resources.'' That would come as great news to everybody--Republicans and Democrats--who has been an appropriator in any session of Congress. He even believes, that if a President ``finds no appropriated funds within a given category'' but can find such money ``in another category,'' he can spend those funds as he wishes so long as the spending is within his broad ``constitutional purview.'' Such views should concern all of us here--Republicans and Democrats alike--who believe, as the Founders of this country believed, that Congress possesses the power of the purse.  Unfortunately, I fear that Mr. Barr's long-held views on Executive power would essentially be weaponized by President Trump--a man who we know derides any limits on his authority. Over the past two years, we have seen the erosion of our institutional checks and balances in the face of creeping authoritarianism. That can't continue.  In conclusion, let me be clear. I respect Mr. Barr. I voted for him when President George H. W. Bush nominated him. As Attorney General, I do not doubt that he would stand faithfully by his genuinely held convictions, but I fear this particular administration needs somebody who would give him a much tighter leash, as Attorneys General have in the past. So because of that, I will vote no on Mr. Barr's nomination.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, 54 years ago, 600 nonviolent protesters set off to march from Selma to Montgomery, AL, to protest the disenfranchisement of Black voters in the South.  They got as far as the Edmund Pettus Bridge when they saw police officers lined up on the other end, waiting with tear gas, clubs, and dogs. The iconic bridge stood between the police and protesters like a physical barrier between hope and violence, democracy and second-class citizenship.  Although the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments--which cemented into law the freedom, citizenship, and voting rights of Black Americans--passed nearly 100 years earlier across the country, literacy tests, poll taxes, violence, and intimidation stood in the way of this constitutional promise. This was especially true in Alabama.  According to the 1961 Civil Rights Commission report, at the time of the famous protests, fewer than 10 percent of the voting-age Black population was registered in Alabama's Montgomery County. This infamous march from Selma was intended to right the wrong and to shine light on the injustice of all the many laws that kept voting from being accessible to Black Americans.  For months leading up to it, a community of activists--led by Martin Luther King, Jr., and of course our esteemed colleague Representative   John Lewis--carried out voting registration drives and nonviolent demonstrations, all against the resistance of the local government and members of the Ku Klux Klan. These efforts laid the groundwork for the march from Selma, which ended with Alabama State troopers attacking the protesters.  The images of the State-sponsored violence were shown across the country, galvanizing the American public in favor of voting rights in a day that has since become known as Bloody Sunday.  Five months later, on August 6, 1965, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. The bill is one of the crowing victories of the civil rights movement and for our American democracy.  This monumental legislation outlawed the malicious barriers to the polls and held States accountable for the discriminatory obstacles imposed on citizens who sought to fulfill their constitutional right. It opened doors for Black citizens across the South to register, to cast a vote, or to run for office in higher numbers than ever before.  As we celebrate this February as Black History Month, we must remember that Black history is American history. We must remember that too often in our Nation's past, the work to create a more perfect Union has fallen upon the shoulders of Americans whose full rights of citizenship were discounted simply because of the color of their skin. The right to vote is a fundamental American tenet. Yet it has historically been denied to men and women of color.  We must remember that when we tell stories of those who fought and struggled to secure voting rights in our Nation's past, it is because their stories serve as a precursor to our own.  Today voting rights are still under attack. Many who survived the brutal attack on Bloody Sunday and lived to see the passage of the Voting Rights Act have also lived to see the same monumental bill weakened by the 2013 Shelby County Supreme Court decision.  They have watched our President and Republican legislators tout myths of voter fraud to justify strict voter ID laws, partisan gerrymandering, and limited access to voting information. These efforts undoubtedly disadvantage Black Americans more than most and put a scourge on the system that defines our democracy. It is an insult to those who were robbed of their freedom and oftentimes their lives to create a more equal future.  One such example of modern voter disenfranchisement can be found in the fact that the United States denies voting rights to citizens with felony convictions. We are one of the exceedingly few Western democracies that permanently strip citizens of their right to vote as a punishment for their crimes.  Let's be clear. We are not talking about voting rights for felons currently incarcerated; we are talking about voting rights for those who have served their time and have since been released, attained jobs, raised a family, paid taxes, and moved on with their lives. Under the current law in 34 States, these individuals are still denied the right to vote, and that is simply unfair and undemocratic.  Black History Month demands that we bring this injustice to light because felony disenfranchisement disproportionately affects men and women of color. One out of thirteen Black Americans is currently unable to vote because of a prior conviction for which they have already served time--a rate that is more than four times greater than the non-Black Americans.  Right now, in total, more than 2 million Americans are unable to vote because of prior convictions, despite having already served their time and paying their debt to society. That is why this year I will again be introducing the Democracy Restoration Act, a bill that would restore voting rights to individuals after they have been released and returned to their community.  I am committed to seeing this legislation passed. My hope is that Black History Month inspires all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me.  We must also combat efforts to intimidate and disenfranchise voters. That is why last year I introduced legislation that would prohibit and penalize knowingly spreading misinformation, such as incorrect polling locations, times, or the necessary forms of identification. This Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Act will prohibit and penalize intentionally and knowingly spreading misinformation to voters that is intended to suppress the vote, including the time and place of an election and restrictions on voter eligibility.  Reliably, these tactics always seem to target minority neighborhoods and are blatant attempts to reduce turnout. Such tactics undermine and corrode our very democracy and threaten the integrity of our electoral system.  In Stacey Abrams' response to the State of the Union last week, she said that ``the foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections, where voters pick their leaders--not where politicians pick their voters.'' This is precisely why I have chosen to speak out about voting rights this month--because this issue defines our moral and democratic character as a nation and because it is an area where we still have so much work left to do.  Casting a vote is one of the most basic and fundamental freedoms in any democracy, and Congress has the responsibility to ensure the right is protected.  Congress has the responsibility to remove barriers to voting and make it easier for people to register to vote, cast their vote, and make sure their votes are counted. No one can appreciate the need for us to meet this responsibility better than Black Americans whose collective story is one of triumph over racist laws and undemocratic norms.  On Black History Month, Congress must vow to follow their example and work together across party lines to make voting easier, fairer, and more accessible to all.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues today in making some brief remarks on William Barr's nomination to serve as Attorney General of the United States.  I had the opportunity to meet with Mr. Barr one-on-one in my office. We had a very good meeting, and we talked in some detail about securing our elections from foreign interference, something that is a major priority of mine, and we really are close in passing a bipartisan bill, which Senator Lankford and I have, called the Secure Elections Act. We just need a little help and support from the administration.  We also talked about modernizing our antitrust enforcement to fit the challenges that we have today and to make our laws as sophisticated as the trillion-dollar companies we are now seeing and the mergers we are seeing all across the United States. So we had a good discussion about that.  We also talked about his family and working in the Justice Department. During the hearing, I gave an opportunity for him to talk to those workers who were, through no fault of their own, furloughed or not getting paid, and he clearly showed respect for the people in the Justice Department. I appreciate all of that. I think that is important to have in an Attorney General.  But I have some serious concerns about this nominee. I had already announced I was opposing him during our Judiciary Committee vote, but I have some serious concerns when you look at the context in which he has come before us.  His nomination comes at a time when there are investigations by a special counsel and multiple U.S. attorney's offices in New York into campaign finance violations and an attempt, as we know, by a foreign adversary to interfere in our elections. This special counsel's investigation has led to indictments or guilty pleas from over 30 people and three companies, including seven former advisers to the President.  These investigations, as we know, go to the heart of the integrity of our elections, our government, and our institutions, and it is why it is essential, first of all, that Special Counsel Mueller and the U.S. attorney's offices be allowed to finish their work free of political interference.  The President, as we know, has made past statements and sent out tweets about Attorney General Sessions: I am critical of him for allowing these investigations to go forward. This is the context we are in. He has made it very clear as to what he is looking for in an Attorney General. He wants someone who will be his lawyer. He wants someone to use the Justice Department, in a way, to protect him.  I think this should worry us because, yes, the Attorney General works for the President, but, more importantly, who the Attorney General really works for are the people, the people of the United States.  The Attorney General of the United States is the people's lawyer and pledges to uphold the rule of law and apply the law equally no matter who you are.  Mr. Barr has made clear, one, that he respects Mr. Mueller, which I truly appreciate. He said that both in my private meeting and on the record at the hearing. But he has also said that he intends to take over supervision of the special counsel's investigation.  He wouldn't commit, at his nomination hearing--despite having written that 19-page memo, he wouldn't commit to following the advice of career ethics lawyers at the Department about whether he should be recused.  Why did that concern me? Well, because he had actually commended the Deputy Attorney General for following those rules, and he had commended Senator and then-Attorney General Sessions for following these rules. So that concerns me.  We know that if he is confirmed, he will be in a position to oversee the special counsel's budget, the scope of the investigation, and he will, ultimately--and this is key--receive the results of investigation under law.  He will get to decide whether the results are released to the public or, perhaps, as he suggested during the hearing, are not released at all, and that is in addition to those related investigations he will oversee. These U.S. Attorney's investigations don't have the special counsel regulations to protect them, so he is in direct line to oversee those.  Even though many of my colleagues asked him to pledge to make Special Counsel Mueller's report public, he wouldn't commit to do so. He always had a way to kind of dodge a commitment to do so, instead of, in my mind, making a full-throated endorsement of releasing that report.  If he is confirmed, he will also have room to make his own interpretation of what the law allows. In fact, as Attorney General, he can make the Department's rules and regulations and issue guidance that would make the difference between transparency and obscurity. That is why we have to look at his judgment on this particular issue.  Maybe if we were in a different time, in a different moment, we would be talking about things like the opioid epidemic and what the Attorney General is doing, which is very important, and I know he does care about that; or we would be devoting our moment, which I wish we could be doing, to antitrust and upgrading the way those laws are enforced and what we should do; or we would be talking, which we should be doing, about the SECOND STEP Act and not just the FIRST STEP Act.  All of those questions were asked in the hearing--immigration reform, very important issues--but we are where we are. We are where we are, and we have to look at his judgment to see what kind of Attorney General he would be at this time with respect to law and order, which, to me, right now, is not just about law and order in our communities--very important--but it is also about law and order when it comes to our entire justice system.  Like many of the nominees from the President, Mr. Barr has demonstrated, just as Justice Kavanaugh did, just as Justice Gorsuch did, an expansive view--an unprecedentedly expansive view of Presidential power. We don't have to look far to see how those views would impact the special counsel's investigation.  Just a few months before he was nominated as a private citizen--I don't have many constituents who would do this, but, for some reason, Mr. Barr decided to send in this 19-page memo as a private citizen. It was no ordinary memo. This memo was 19 pages, single-spaced, and addressed to the leadership of the Justice Department, but it was sent to all of these people--conservative activists and all kinds of people all over the place, the lawyers at the White House Counsel's office, and the President's personal lawyers. I don't think my constituents would really have their addresses or emails, but it was sent to all of these people.  It argued that a portion of the special counsel's obstruction of justice inquiry was ``fatally misconceived.'' He said that it was based on a legally insupportable reading of the law.  Now, that makes you pause. How can we be sure, how can we think he can impartially evaluate the special counsel's investigation if, before he has even seen its result, he writes extensively that part of it, not all of it, was legally insupportable and fatally misconceived?  It is not just those statements that are troubling. He goes on to state, not for the first time, his alarming views about the President's powers. Here is one of them: ``[T]he President's law enforcement powers extend to all matters, including those in which he had a personal stake.''  Mr. Barr doesn't cite laws or cases from the Supreme Court or the history of our Nation's founding or even the Federalist Papers when making his claims. He just says it as if it is obvious.  Let me be clear about what he means by this. Mr. Barr believes that a President gets to supervise an investigation into his or her own conduct. As a former prosecutor, I know that it is a fundamental value in our country that no one--no one--is above the law, and it is a fundamental principle in our legal system that no one should be a judge in their own case, not even the President of the United States.  I also have grave doubts about Mr. Barr's respect for Congress, a coequal branch of government, and our duty to provide oversight of the executive branch.  Mr. Barr is a proponent of the unitary executive theory, which is the idea that the President has expansive powers, even in the face of Congress's constitutional duties. His writings on the topic raise serious questions about how Mr. Barr will approach congressional oversight of the administration.  I am concerned that Mr. Barr will rely on the broad interpretation of Executive power to support the White House's reported efforts to exert Executive privilege to prevent the release of the special counsel report, its findings, or its conclusions.  If that happens, Congress must be ready to assert our responsibility to make sure the public and, especially, State election officials who are working to secure our elections have the facts about what happened.  How are we going to fix this in the next election if we don't know what happened? How are we going to have accountability for our government if the public is shut out in viewing what happened?  This is not the time to install an Attorney General who has repeatedly espoused a view of unfettered Executive power. Congress cannot abdicate its responsibilities or shirk its duties--not when it comes to national security, foreign relations, the budget, or, as is key today, oversight into law and order.  A few years ago, I went to Atlanta to make a speech, and, of course, I took a little trip over to the Carter Presidential Library. Of course, I wanted to see this library--I had never seen it--to learn more about President Carter, but as a Minnesotan, I really wanted to look for all the Mondale memorabilia. I may have been the only one there looking for Joan's dress and other things related to the Mondale half of the Carter-Mondale team.  One of the things I noticed that to me was most prominent was a quote of Walter Mondale's etched on the wall. At the time, I liked it. I thought it was simple. I wrote it down, and I put it in my purse. But I never knew how relevant it would be today. The quote came from Mondale's reflections on his service with President Carter after they had lost their reelection but had served their country for 4 years. He said:       We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace.  I believe that is the minimum standard we should expect of any administration. We told the truth. We obeyed the law. We kept the peace. Every President faces great challenges, many of which are unforeseen and require difficult decisions, but at the minimum, an administration should tell the truth, obey the law, and do all they can to keep the peace.  That is where I will end. What concerns me about this nominee is not the vast experience he has or the work he would do on a few of the things that I mentioned; it is his views on Executive power, his views on Congress's power to be a check and balance to the Executive, his views on what the Executive can do right as we face this crucial time in history, when coming right at us is this major report from the special counsel. I want someone who will make sure that whoever is in the White House obeys the law and tells the truth.  Sadly, I cannot support this nominee. I do hope that I am wrong in some of my conclusions based on what I have read and heard. I would like nothing more.  I appreciate so much the work of Rod Rosenstein as Deputy Attorney General and many of the other people in the Justice Department who have worked with him to allow this investigation to continue. I hope that will be the case if this nominee does go through this Chamber, that he will do the same.  Thank you, Mr. President.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, cyber attacks are one of the greatest threats to our national security today. As our world becomes increasingly connected, bad actors are trying to infiltrate our most critical networks, from our military systems and our electrical grid to our financial institutions and our small businesses.  We face a rising number of cyber attacks that have the potential to expose our sensitive, personal information or disrupt nearly every aspect of our lives. These cyber security vulnerabilities cut across every industry. Whether you are a small business trying to protect your customers' credit card details, a doctor's office with private medical insurance information, or even a sophisticated tech startup that needs to safeguard your customers' passwords, cyber security protections are absolutely vital to your success.  We have seen the dangerous consequences of attacks that exposed the private data of millions of Americans--from companies like Equifax and Target to Federal Agencies like the Office of Personnel Management and the IRS. Government Agencies of all sizes are at risk of a breach that could jeopardize the sensitive information they are trusted with, and these threats will only continue to grow.  We need a skilled cyber workforce of professionals to shore up our cyber protections, fortify our legacy systems, and build new and innovative infrastructure with safety and security in mind. Despite the glaring need for more cyber security professionals, we face a serious shortage of highly trained cyber experts to fill these positions. Estimates indicate there is a global shortage of approximately 3 million desperately needed cyber security professionals, including nearly half a million in North America, where government and the private sector are competing to hire the best talent.  The Federal Government faces serious challenges in this competition. Agencies often cannot offer the same top salaries and benefits that Silicon Valley uses to entice and to retain employees. Our cyber workforce is on the frontlines of every aspect of our digital security, and we need policies that address that reality and sustain and grow our ranks.  While thousands of dedicated public servants choose to work in government because they are motivated by the mission of serving our country, there is more we can do to grow the pool of cyber workers and recruit them to government service. Congress has made strides in recent years to improve incentives and attract skilled cyber professionals to join the ranks.  Moving forward, we can make cyber positions in government more attractive by providing cyber professionals with unique opportunities to enhance their careers while they help protect our country's security. That is why I introduced the Federal Rotational Cyber Workforce Program Act with Senator Hoeven. Our bipartisan legislation helps the Federal Government develop an integrated cyber security workforce that retains high-skilled employees by establishing a civilian personnel rotation program specifically for cyber professionals. It is based on similar joint duty programs for the military services and the intelligence community.  The Rotational Cyber Workforce Program will provide civilian employees in cyber roles opportunities to enhance their careers, broaden their professional experience, and foster collaborative networks by experiencing and contributing to the cyber mission beyond their home Agencies. By offering these kinds of dynamic and rewarding opportunities, this legislation will help retain highly talented cyber professionals and strengthen our government's security by developing greater interagency awareness and collaboration.  I am pleased that this morning the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee unanimously approved this legislation. It moves us closer to closing the cyber security workforce gap.  In addition to taking commonsense steps like we did today in committee, Congress needs to look ahead and plan for long-term solutions to ensure that we always have a strong, competitive pool of cyber security talent to draw on. We need policies that encourage students of all ages and educational levels to seek out STEM fields, such as computer science, so they are prepared to fill these in-demand jobs and be our first line of defense against these emerging and rapidly evolving threats.  I look forward to continuing to work with my Republican and Democratic colleagues to get this bill signed into law and to advance other commonsense legislation that strengthens our Nation's cyber capabilities and safeguards the weakest links in the cyber security chain from harm.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I come to the floor for two reasons: No. 1, to speak about the tax bill of 1 year ago, and then, for a longer period of time, to address the issue before the Senate, which is the nomination of Mr. Barr.  The tax filing season began just over 2 weeks ago. Despite the disruption of the temporary partial government shutdown, the IRS is reporting to the Nation that all systems are go. Tax returns are being processed as normal, and refunds are being sent out. While there are lingering effects from the shutdown, overall, the IRS and Treasury have done a pretty good job of minimizing the effects of the shutdown on tax filers.  This season is receiving additional scrutiny as it is the very first time that tax filers are filing under the tax cuts and reforms enacted last year. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle and some in the media appear to be obsessed with finding anything they can manufacture to declare the filing season under the new law a failure. Of course, that is after only 2 weeks of tax filing--not a long enough period of time to draw too many conclusions.  Case in point: Last week the IRS released preliminary filing data covering the first weeks of the filing season. Immediately, naysayers began focusing on data that suggests that tax refunds in the first week were down slightly over last year, as well as focusing on anecdotal social media posts. Never mind that the current refund numbers are based on only a few days of data, or that refund statistics can vary widely from one week to the next. Never mind that most of the social media posts are unverified. Many have the markings of a coordinated effort by liberal activists who have regularly used hashtag ``GOP tax scam'' to attack the law on Twitter, despite a vast majority of taxpayers paying less in taxes.  Yet our journalists, who are well educated and ought to know better, fall for it--hook, line, and sinker--including such tweets in articles with no questions asked or verifying the veracity of these claims.  To be fair, oftentimes buried deep in such articles, well below a sensational headline, is an attempt to demonstrate some semblance of unbiased reports, noting that under the tax law, most taxpayers will see tax cuts. That is right. Most taxpayers will see tax cuts. You most assuredly wouldn't know this from the headlines bemoaning a reduction in tax refunds, but the vast majority of taxpayers experienced a tax cut last year, and will this year, as well.  Every analysis--from the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation to the right-leaning Tax Foundation, to the liberal Tax Policy Center--demonstrates that taxpayers are sending less of their hard-earned money to Washington this year.  As an example, an Iowa family of four with the State's family median income of around $75,000 stands to see their tax bill cut by more than half, or about $2,100 in savings. This is real tax relief that began appearing in many taxpayers' paychecks at the start of 2018. That is a very important point. The government could have chosen to deprive this taxpayer of this extra $2,100 last year until they filed their taxes during this tax season.  This may have been the best thing to do if you are someone who starts with the assumption that their money would be better off in the hands of the government interest-free. But I do not believe that is the best thing to do.  I believe taxpayers know better how to spend their hard-earned money than Washington does. It should be up to the individual taxpayer whether it is in his or her interest to put that extra $2,100--or about $175 a month--in a savings account or spend it on buying school supplies for their children or maybe even making a car payment. That is a decision 157 million taxpayers can make and not 535 Members of Congress or the bureaucrats who are out spending the money.  In early 2018, Treasury and the IRS implemented updated withholding tables to give taxpayers that option of deciding whether to save or spend and what to spend it on or how to save it.  A chief priority for the new withholding tables was accuracy. The IRS' goal was to help taxpayers get the right amount withheld from their paycheck. However, common sense ought to tell us that no withholding table will ever be perfect--at least not perfect for 157 million different taxpayers. If they were, there would be no need for tax refunds. Only what was necessary to satisfy a taxpayer's tax obligation would need to be taken from their paychecks.  But that is unlikely. Every taxpayer is affected a little differently under the Tax Code based on their personal circumstances, and some taxpayers' incomes may fluctuate throughout the year. This makes exact withholding based on general tables nearly impossible. As a result, the amount of a taxpayers' refund is unlikely to be exactly the same as it was under the old law compared to our new law. Yes, some taxpayers may see a smaller refund, but others may see a larger refund. The size of one's refund tells you nothing about whether a specific taxpayer benefited from last year's tax law.  Given this fact, the best way for any taxpayer to see how tax reform affected their bottom line is to compare this year's tax return with last year's tax return, rather than making that judgment based upon what the refund is.  Tax preparers and tax return software often will provide an analysis comparing the current and previous year's tax return. I encourage taxpayers to compare the total amount of taxes paid this year with the total taxes paid last year, or, if your income materially changed from last year, compare your effective tax rate. That is the taxes paid as a percentage of your adjusted gross income. If your tax preparer does not already provide you with this information, simply ask them for that information.  If taxpayers take this approach, the vast majority will see that their tax bill has gone down. This is what matters, not the size of their refund. The size of the refund tells you nothing beyond the degree to which a taxpayer has overpaid their taxes over the course of the year. I hope Americans will take the time to check so they know the real effects that last year's tax cuts had on their lives and their family."

                "speech":" Mr. President, I will now turn my attention to the vote that will happen shortly today or tomorrow on William Barr to be Attorney General for the United States.  Mr. Barr is a highly accomplished attorney and an experienced public servant with an outstanding record. The Justice Department needs good, effective leadership, and we should act quickly to fill this top spot.  I believe that Mr. Barr will be a good leader for the Justice Department as he has demonstrated in the past. In my opinion, at his Judiciary Committee nomination hearing, Mr. Barr was very candid with Senators. I believe he did his best at answering questions on his views on a wide variety of topics, as well as addressing concerns, including my own.  For example, at the beginning of this confirmation process, I had concerns regarding Mr. Barr's prior negative statements on a subject that I have been working on for 4 years with Senator Durbin and Senator Lee--criminal justice reform.  In particular, I was concerned about a 1992 Justice Department report released when he was Attorney General entitled ``The Case for More Incarceration.'' That title ought to tell you that he is tough on law enforcement. I was also concerned about a letter he signed in 2015 opposing the bill that we then entitled the Sentencing Reform and Correction Act of 2015. Obviously, if I think we need criminal justice reform for the first time in a generation, and the Attorney General puts out a letter against the part of it that Senator Durbin and I were working so hard on--by the way, the President signed that just before Christmas--then, I think it is legitimate that I ask him these questions.  As Attorney General, Mr. Barr will be responsible for implementing the recently passed FIRST STEP Act of 2018, which 89 Members of this body supported. These Members also worked tirelessly for its passage. The FIRST STEP Act is the title of the bill that I call criminal justice reform. This is why one of my first questions during his confirmation hearing was to directly and clearly ask Mr. Barr if he would commit to fully implementing the FIRST STEP Act, considering the fact that he had written a letter 3 years ago against the concept.  His answer was very clear and convincing to me, and that was one word--``yes.'' He went on to say: ``I have no problem with the approach of reforming the prison structure and I will faithfully implement the law.'' Later in the hearing, other Senators pointed to Mr. Barr's past stances on criminal justice and sentencing reform. Those Members asked for Mr. Barr's current views on the subject. They also asked for assurances that Mr. Barr would dutifully implement the FIRST STEP Act, just like I asked that question.  Mr. Barr expressed his current misgivings about high sentences for drug offenders established in the 1990s. Each time, he answered very clearly that he would dutifully implement the FIRST STEP Act and work to ensure that the intent of Congress was realized. Mr. Barr's answers regarding the FIRST STEP Act relieved my concerns of his past statements.  While I will continue to use the oversight powers of Congress to ensure that the FIRST STEP Act is applied and implemented as required by law, I believe Mr. Barr's testimony, and I look forward to working with him on both the implementation of the current law and future steps in criminal justice reform.  I want to go on to another issue of importance to me, which was Mr. Barr's position on the False Claims Act. If you remember my participation in the False Claims Act, going back to 1986, that act has brought in $59 billion of fraudulently taken money from the Federal taxpayers. Leaders and top prosecutors of both sides of the aisle have now praised the law as the most effective tool the government has to detect, to prosecute, and actually to recover public money lost to fraud. Most of the $59 billion has come as a result of patriotic whistleblowers who found the fraud and brought the cases at their own risk.  To let you know why I am concerned about Mr. Barr's opinion, in the past he was extremely critical of the False Claims Act, even after it was signed by President Reagan. He called it unconstitutional. At one time, he said it was an ``abomination.'' So at his nomination hearing, I pointedly asked Mr. Barr whether he believed the False Claims Act is unconstitutional. He said: ``No, Senator. It's been upheld by the Supreme Court.''  Mr. Barr also stated that he would fully and faithfully implement this very important law. He acknowledged the benefits of the False Claims Act and said: ``I will diligently enforce the False Claims Act.''  I also asked Mr. Barr about his stance on something called the ``Granston Memo.'' That memo provides a long list of reasons that the Justice Department can use to dismiss False Claims Act cases. Some of these reasons are pretty vague, such as ``preserving government resources.'' Just think as to how that can be used by some faceless bureaucrat to avoid some issue, like maybe he doesn't want to go after fraudulent money or doesn't like some whistleblower. Obviously, those words could mean anything the government wants it to mean.  Of course, the government ought to be able to dismiss, obviously, meritless cases, but we don't want to give broad discretion to the administration without good justification. Even when the Justice Department declines to participate in a False Claims Act case, the whistleblower can and, in many cases, still does recover taxpayers' money.  Although Mr. Barr had not yet read the memo, he pledged to sit down with me if problems arose. These are positive steps and positive statements. However, actions speak louder than words. So I want Mr. Barr to know that I am going to monitor aggressively how he enforces and protects the False Claims Act to ensure that he follows through on his promises.  On another matter, during his confirmation hearing, I pressed Mr. Barr about transparency with regard to the special counsel's report. I made very clear that I want the report to be made public because taxpayers deserve to know what their money is being spent on--in this case, maybe $25 million to $35 million. I am not sure we have an exact figure, but it is a lot of money. The only way the American taxpayers and Congress can hold the government accountable is through transparency.  You have heard me say many times that transparency brings accountability. Of course, there are some traditional reasons for withholding certain information even in a special counsel's report, such as national security or people's privacy, but there should be as much transparency as possible regarding the release of the report.  During his hearing, Mr. Barr said that he would place a high priority on transparency, particularly with Mueller's report, and there is no reason to think that Mr. Mueller will not be allowed to finish his work. Mr. Barr told me and other members of this committee that he would ``provide as much transparency as [he] can consistent with the law and the Department's longstanding practices and policies.'' There is a lot of room there for him to work within, I suppose, and to still be honest in these answers. At this point, I can tell you I have no reason to doubt Mr. Barr's sincerity or his commitment to transparency and the law.  If he is confirmed, I will be sure to hold Mr. Barr to his word on transparency. Yet I also realize that there are some differences of opinion around here on what is currently required under the Justice Department's special counsel regulations. That is why Senator Blumenthal and I recently introduced S. 236, the Special Counsel Transparency Act. This bill would require by statute that a special counsel provide a report to Congress and the American people at the conclusion of an investigation, not just Mueller's special counsel report but special counsels' reports into the future. This is commonsense transparency and accountability under any administration, not just under the Trump administration. I look forward to working with my colleagues and Mr. Barr, if he is confirmed, on this important legislation.  I also pressed the nominee on a number of other issues that were related to transparency and accountability, including the Freedom of Information Act--or, as we call it around here, FOIA--and the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Around here, we refer to that as FARA. When I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I helped to steer the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 into law, which creates a very important point--a ``presumption of openness'' standard. The Justice Department oversees the Federal Government's compliance with FOIA. So that is why we discussed it with Barr. It is critical that the nominee, if confirmed to lead the Justice Department, takes FOIA and transparency seriously. When you talk about a presumption of openness, it ought to be this simple: Any of the public's business ought to be public, and you presume it to be public. Let the government give a justification as to why it ought to be kept secret or not be open to the public under the Freedom of Information Act.  I asked Mr. Barr if he agreed that FOIA were an important tool for holding the government accountable. Naturally, he said yes. I also asked the nominee if he would commit to ensuring the faithful and timely implementation of the 2016 FOIA amendments. He said: ``Yes, we will work hard on that.'' I also think that the entire FOIA process would be improved if Americans didn't have to fight tooth and nail for disclosure in the first place. Let me repeat that--fight tooth and nail for disclosure. That is why we have a presumption of openness when it comes to the Freedom of Information Act.  Getting the public's information out to the public automatically should be a top priority. So I asked Mr. Barr if he would help to advocate for the more proactive disclosure of government records. Again, he said he would. I appreciate Mr. Barr's assurances. Of course, as I have said so many times during these remarks on different issues, I expect to hold him true to his word.  Then, I went to the Foreign Agents Registration Act, or FARA. I asked him about the importance of it. My oversight work has highlighted the Justice Department's historically lax enforcement of that act. I think we had a hearing on it and found out that since 1937 there have been fewer than a dozen prosecutions under it. Now, all of a sudden, with Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey and a lot of other places, it has come to my attention that there are a lot of people who even recently haven't registered under it. On the other hand, I will bet people are hastening to register very fast.  Yet the law has some shortcomings. In an age in which we are witnessing more foreign government efforts to influence the American public and policymakers, we should see more transparency and more enforcement against bad actors, not less enforcement. So I asked Mr. Barr if he agreed that FARA was an important national security and accountability tool, and he said yes.  I asked Mr. Barr if he would be sure to make FARA enforcement a top priority under his leadership. Again, he said he would.  I also asked Mr. Barr if he would commit to working with me on my bill to improve FARA. This bill before Congress is called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, and it seeks to better ensure transparency and accountability. Again, he said yes. Again, Mr. Barr can expect that I will hold him to his word.  I also asked Mr. Barr about his position on antitrust enforcement--specifically, whether he would ensure that healthcare and prescription drug antitrust issues would be a top priority for the Justice Department.  The nominee responded: ``Competition is an important factor in containing the costs of healthcare'' and that he would ``work with the Antitrust Division to ensure appropriate and effective criminal and civil enforcement to protect Americans' interests in low-cost, high-quality healthcare.'' He stated that if confirmed, antitrust enforcement in the healthcare and pharmaceutical sectors ``will remain a priority'' for the Justice Department.  I also expressed to the candidate my concerns about agriculture competition. He indicated that enforcing the antitrust laws in the agriculture sector will remain a priority.  The topics I just discussed are just some of the areas that I asked Mr. Barr about at the confirmation hearing and in written questions for the record, and my Judiciary Committee colleagues questioned Mr. Barr at length on a variety of topics. I take Mr. Barr at his word. I don't believe he would bow to any kind of pressure, even from the President, if he thought there were a problem with the legality, constitutionality, or ethics of an issue. He is an excellent nominee--extremely competent and experienced.  Mr. Barr previously led the Justice Department and has proven his strong leadership abilities. Recall that back in 1991 the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported Mr. Barr's nomination to be Attorney General under President George H.W. Bush. Can you believe it? The Senate confirmed him by a voice vote.  What has changed after 25 years?  I don't know, except that there is something some people think is wrong if a person by the name of Trump nominates somebody to some office. The only difference I can see is that even in the last 25 years, he has proven himself to be in the private sector what he did so well as a public servant. He is a very capable attorney and a straight shooter. He is willing to engage in productive discussions with Congress. That is a key quality that we want in anybody who runs the Justice Department, and I have had enough trouble with the Justice Department.  I hope he will respond to my requests for oversight information more than the Democrats and Republicans had who preceded him. He is committed to working with me on my oversight requests, and I think my colleagues know that that is a responsibility that I take seriously.  He will uphold the law and the Constitution. Mr. Barr deserves our support, and one can tell from my remarks that I am, obviously, proud to vote for him.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as the former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Iowa, has just pointed out, the Senate will soon vote on the nomination of William Barr to serve as Attorney General.  As has also been pointed out, this is, undoubtedly, one of the most qualified nominees to come before the Senate in his having already held the same position under President George H.W. Bush. He has also served as an intelligence analyst at the CIA, as an Assistant Attorney General in the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, and as Deputy Attorney General before he served as Attorney General.  His confirmation hearing lasted more than 12 hours, during which time he and other witnesses answered hundreds of questions on a wide variety of issues he might confront as Attorney General. He was straightforward and forthcoming. He earned high praise even from the ranking Democrat on that committee--our colleague, Senator Feinstein from California--who said:       He's obviously very smart. He was Attorney General before.      . . . No one can say he isn't qualified. I was thinking last      night, obviously Mr. Barr is qualified. He is bright. He is      capable.  She could have said more, but one of the things she said after that is, ``I won't be voting for him.''  This is an important job for the American people. There are a lot of jobs out there to be filled. It is hard to argue that any of them are more important than this one, but it is also hard to argue that there is not something wrong with a process where that is the comment that could be made, followed not too long after that by: I won't be voting for him.  Senator Grassley pointed out that the last time Bill Barr was confirmed to be Attorney General, it was by voice vote. It seems as if that must have been a long time ago. It hasn't been that long ago; it is just the way the Senate used to work. That is why the Rules Committee that I chair voted out a Senate resolution earlier today dealing with this issue. This should not be the problem that it is. It shouldn't be an issue, but, frankly, the nomination process is broken.  In every election in this country, one thing has been certain: At least one party will not be happy with the result. I certainly understand why our Democratic colleagues weren't happy with the results of the 2016 election. There have been elections I have not been happy about and some that I have been happier about than others even when I was happy. This is a process that makes it easy not to be pleased with what voters decide to do, but that doesn't give you the right to stand in the way of what voters try to do, and that is exactly what our friends on the other side of the aisle have done.  Over the past 2 years, we have had unprecedented obstruction when it comes to just trying to put a government in place, unprecedented obstruction to confirming a President's nominees. During the first Congress President Trump was in office, the previous 2 years, he submitted 1,136 nominees for jobs across the Federal Government. During that same period of time, President Obama submitted 1,132 nominees.  By the way, President Trump is sometimes criticized for not getting the nominees up here quickly enough. He actually got four more nominees up during that period of time than President Obama did, but the Senate confirmed 920 of President Obama's nominees during that first 2 years, and the Senate only confirmed 714 of President Trump's nominees--barely half for President Trump and about 70 percent, 75 percent for President Obama. There is a nearly 200-person difference, but more important, maybe, than the difference is the obvious effort for us not to be able to get other work done.  At the end of the last Congress, we returned the largest number of nominees from any President since Ronald Reagan. There are really only two reasons for that. One is to, frankly, stall the confirmation process and make it difficult for the President to do the job of being President. If you don't get the people to help you do the job you are elected to do, you can't do the job as effectively as you would otherwise.  We just had a government shutdown, which I think all of us were disappointed by. That is bad policy. We don't want to repeat it again. We didn't want to repeat it that time. But we have a partial shutdown of many of these Agencies and parts of the government every single day because we don't have the people necessary to put the rules in place.  There was a lot of discussion during the government shutdown about farmers who weren't able to get the loan guarantees they needed because the office was closed. Well, to some extent, it is the same way when the door is open but the people aren't there, when the door is open but the rules for the new farm bill haven't been issued, and when the door is open but the trade regulations that need to be made for the tax bill aren't out there.  The other reason, by the way, the second reason, is just to use up floor time. There are only so many things we can do here on the Senate floor. The majority leader is fond of saying that the most precious commodity in the Senate is floor time. If we are required to drag out this process, as the minority has insisted we do for the last 2 years, things don't happen otherwise.  During the first 2 years of the Trump administration, there were 128 cloture votes right here--128 cloture votes. That is where a Democrat--usually the minority leader--insists that we are going to have to get a majority of votes to even have the debate on a candidate. Once you file that, that takes a day before you can even begin to have the debate, and then the debate is 30 hours. So half a week is gone before the week starts just trying to confirm one person for one thing. That could be as important as a Supreme Court Justice, or it could be the lowest level of confirmation in any of the Agencies of government.  By the way, those are the people who haven't been put in place because obviously lifetime judges matter, and both parties would prioritize that.  There have been 128 cloture votes. In the first 2 years of the past three Presidents, there were cloture votes a total of 24 times--24 times. That is an average of 8 compared to 128. There is a lot of difference between 8 and 128.  Because the tradition of the Senate--as a matter of fact, I think if President Bush were on here, President George H. W. Bush--that number was zero. No time. And that was much more traditional, up until that time, than now.  When President Reagan was President, once a nominee got out of committee, it was an average of 5 days before that nominee had a vote here on the Senate floor. It was normally the same kind of voice vote that Senator Grassley mentioned that Bill Barr had the last time. The average was 5 days. With President Trump, it was 55 days before a nominee could get a vote once they got out of committee.  Remember, if you have agreed to serve in one of these jobs, you have given all of your financial information, you have given all of your personal information, and you have been investigated through and through. You have appeared before a committee, and they have asked you every question they could think of to ask you. They have voted you out of that committee. And then 24 people, at the end of last year, were sent back to the White House, at the end of that conference--I think it was over 24 people, over two dozen people--who had been waiting 1 year to become maybe the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Interior.  This will not work. This is not how our system is supposed to work, and we need to move forward. And it is not like when this happens--when these 128 cloture votes happen--there is a huge debate. There are 30 hours, plus the intervening day, but that doesn't mean there is any big debate. In fact, usually there is almost no debate at all on these nominees. When the nominees were voted on, 48 percent of the nominees got over 60 votes and 37 percent of the nominees got over 70 votes. So clearly this is not about holding back somebody who could be confirmed; it is about using up time that should be used for other things.  There are two jobs in the Senate. One of them is the personnel business. One of them is confirming people the President nominates. But the other is the legislating business. The other is the funding the government business. The other is the talking about foreign policy business. The other is talking about the economy and trade and taxes. Every hour we spend on this is an hour we can't spend on that.  The resolution we passed out today was one I introduced with my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Lankford, who has been working on this issue for 2 years now, and others of us have as well. We introduced this bill to cut the amount of time back to what had been a temporary standing order when Republicans were in the minority, and we agreed to this temporary standing order. The Democrats were in the majority. There was a Democrat in the White House. We agreed to essentially this same framework: 2 hours for most nominees, 30 hours for circuit judges and Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet officers. Seventy-eight Senators voted for that temporary order.  Usually when you do you a temporary order, it is to see if it works. Well, it worked, but we didn't do it again. So we are now saying, let's make that temporary order a permanent part of the way the Senate approaches this part of its job. We are moving in that direction. We had a debate this morning in committee. The time we are spending on the floor--if there is a nominee who needs 30 hours, they are almost certainly going to be in that category that gets 30 hours. If there is a nominee who would be in the 2-hour category, they are going to have been through committee, they are going to have been thoroughly vetted, and the committee will have decided they should be reported out. We need to get back to where 5 days after that, the Senate lets this person go on to fill a job that is, in all likelihood, not going to last beyond one administration and maybe not even that.  It won't be long before nobody is willing to sign up if a year later, after you have put your life on hold, you find out that the Senate somehow can't get to the job you have agreed to serve on because we have to take time that the Senate never took before.  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle look at that standing order that could change our rules in a way that allows people who are willing to serve to be thoroughly vetted, thoroughly questioned, and then voted on. This can't happen unless they get voted on. Clearly, the current process of voting on people is a process that has been abused.  While the Senate is a place that recognizes the rights of the minority, those rights have only been upheld when the minority viewed them for what they are--rights of the minority rather than tools of the minority to obstruct the elected Government of the United States of America and the work of the Senate.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, we have finally completed our work on S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act. We had a good day yesterday. We had a good day here in the U.S. Senate. We passed this significant bill--really, a landmark piece of legislation--out of the Senate by a vote of 92 to 8. That is pretty strong. You don't see a lot of that in the Senate anymore--every now and again, and this was one of those every now and agains. I appreciate all the work.  We have now sent this over to the House of Representatives, and it has some good momentum. We are looking forward to being able to work with the House. I encourage them to move quickly on this important measure and see it enacted into law.  I want to take just a few moments this afternoon, while I can, to thank so many who have been key in getting us to this point. I want to start my comments with acknowledging the former ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Cantwell from Washington. We have spent a lot of time together. We have spent a lot of time over the years working on these lands bills. We did it in the public forum through the committee process. We had hearings on hundreds of bills. We worked to refine and reach agreement on them and to report them from committee. So there was all of that process, which went on throughout the committee, and then the two of us sitting down with our staffs on noncommittee time, just working through these particulars, in many meetings in my office and in her office. We really did this on a bipartisan basis. We stuck together. There were times when the prospects for this package did not look so good, and then there were moments when it looked even worse than not so good. But we kind of pulled one another along. I think that is a tribute to the commitment we made as colleagues and partners in this to advance not just to a message but to a product. I truly think that is a tribute to Senator Cantwell and her willingness to work together to find a path forward.  Then we weren't able to finish things at the end of the year. Senator Cantwell moved over to another committee, and I had an opportunity to pick up with Senator Manchin. He picked up.  Here he comes in, a new ranking member, and he has a bill to help manage on the floor with some 100-plus bills. But he helped us in a way that I am most, most grateful for. He kept us on track and helped us secure a very strong final tally here.  I am also very grateful to my other corners, the chairman and ranking member of the Natural Resources Committee on the House side, Chairman Grijalva and Ranking Member Bishop. I thank them for their exceptional, exceptional work on this package and look forward to working with them as we finish this out.  Next on my list are Leader McConnell and Senator Schumer. The minority leader is here. We had a conversation on the floor just about where he is sitting--this was back in December. But the two leaders gave their commitment to take this bill up early this year. They kept that commitment. They made it happen. I thank them for what they did in recognizing that this public lands, resources, and waters bill deserved early attention in this new Congress.  I mentioned on the floor that there were many colleagues on both sides: Senator Heinrich, Senator Gardner, Senator Daines from Montana, Senator Wyden from Oregon, all of whom have been great partners here on the floor.  It is important to briefly mention the staffs, who put in the long hours--the work and the family life they gave up.  The first person on my list to recognize is my deputy chief counsel, Lucy Murfitt, who is truly an expert, a true expert on the lands issue. She has poured her heart and soul into these issues, and it is no exaggeration to say they would not have happened without her efforts.  I also thank my staff director, Brian Hughes; my chief counsel, Kellie Donnelly; the members of my lands team, Annie Hoefler, Lane Dickson, and Michelle Lane; our communications team, Nicole Daigle, Michelle Toohey, and Tonya Parish; our support staff, including Melissa Enriquez and Sean Solie; then Brianne Miller and Isaac Edwards, who basically kept the committee running while everyone else was focusing on this bill.  While I am proud of my team, we had great partners on the other side of the aisle. Sarah Venuto and Lance West joined the committee with Senator Manchin, and they have been great to work with. Sam Fowler, David Brooks, Rebecca Bonner, Bryan Petit, Camille Touton, Mary Louise Wagner, and Amit Ronen also played key roles.  Then on the House side, we had David Watkins and Brandon Bragato of Chairman Grijalva's staff, along with Parish Braden and Cody Stewart, who has now left the Hill, of Ranking Member Bishop's staff.  I have to give a shout-out for the floor staff. Laura Dove and her team were fabulous. We also appreciate our Parliamentarians, Elizabeth McDonough and Leigh Hildebrand; Terry Van Doren with Leader McConnell; and Aniela Butler at the Senate Budget Committee.  Two of the individuals who probably put the most time into this package, Heather Burnham and Christina Kennelly, are in the Office of Senate Leg Counsel. I also thank Janani Shankaran, Kim Cawley, and Aurora Swanson at CBO.  Great members, great team--we could not have done this great work without them.  To Senator Schumer, I say thank you for allowing me to complete this in its entirety. I appreciate your indulgence."

                "speech":"Mr. President, let me thank the chair of the Energy Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska, for the wonderful work she always does around here. She has the respect of Members on both sides of the aisle. She tries to do the right thing and ends up there so often. This lands bill wouldn't have happened without a lot of the people she mentioned, but at the top of the list would certainly, certainly, be the senior Senator from Alaska.  Once again, I tip my hat to the junior Senator from Washington State, who worked so long and hard on this. The two of them were a great team, and Joe Manchin filled in when he became ranking member. We are all very glad that this wonderful lands bill, with so many good things in it, will, barring any unforeseen mishap, become law very soon. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to address the nomination of Mr. William Barr to be the next Attorney General of the United States.  We take all these nominations very seriously. Each member of the President's Cabinet holds immense influence within our government, with the power to affect the lives of millions. At this moment in time, the Attorney General might be the very most critical of all of the Cabinet officials in our government.  Not only will the Attorney General assume the traditional responsibilities of the office, but the next Attorney General would also oversee one of the most sensitive investigations in our Nation's history--the special counsel's investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 elections. Just to say those words, ``Russian influence in the 2016 elections,'' makes your hair stand on end a little bit.  Under normal circumstances, the position of Attorney General demands an individual of unimpeachable integrity, impartiality, and independence. Under these circumstances, that bar is more important and probably higher than ever. Why? Because as we have all seen, President Trump has demonstrated utter contempt for the rule of law. He has expressed a view of the Department of Justice that is completely counter to the history of this grand Department as an independent Agency of the law. Rather, he views the Justice Department as an Agency that should protect him personally and one he can compel to protect his friends and prosecute his enemies. That sounds like a third-world country, not the United States of America.  In the process of attempting to discredit the special counsel's investigation, the President has run roughshod over the norms of the executive branch's relationship with the Justice Department. President Trump has demeaned the public servants of the Justice Department. He has questioned its motives, up to and including the upgrading and belittling of the former Attorney General on Twitter--an Attorney General that he himself appointed.  As the special counsel continues to investigate the connections between the most senior members of the Trump administration and the Kremlin, it is an extraordinarily important and extraordinarily dangerous moment for the Justice Department. That is the maelstrom into which the next Attorney General will step.  Certainly, Mr. Barr is intelligent. Certainly, Mr. Barr has experience. In fact, he already did the job. Let me say that I have always respected his public service and believed him to be a good man, but what so many of us find lacking in Mr. Barr's nomination this time around is his fundamental lack of awareness about the moment we are in.  Only a few months ago, it was uncovered that he authored an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department criticizing--criticizing--the special counsel's investigation. He wasn't involved with the Justice Department in any capacity at the time. He was a private attorney. He could not have had access to any of the facts in the case. Yet he decided to write this memo, which, in addition to making unevidenced claims about the investigation, outlined an extremely broad--in my judgment--overreaching vision of Executive power. Writing that memo showed poor judgment and, worse, it showed bias at a time when the country could not afford either in its Attorney General.  I felt the memo alone was disqualifying at a time when we have a President who scorns the rule of law, but I believed Mr. Barr deserved the chance to change my mind so I met with him privately a few weeks ago. Our conversation focused on three questions.  First, I asked him very directly if he would recuse himself if the ethics officials at the Justice Department said he should. He would not commit to doing this. Instead, he said he would make his own decision.  Second, I asked him if he would release the special counsel's full report on Russian influence in the 2016 election, with, of course, appropriate redactions that the intelligence services would require. His response was to say: ``I'm for transparency.'' That is not good enough.  He is a good lawyer. Everyone knows when you can make an ironclad commitment or when you have words that seem good but don't make such a commitment. To say you are for transparency doesn't say very much. I asked for an unequivocal and public commitment to release the report. He would not give that assurance.  Finally, I asked Mr. Barr to commit that he would not interfere in any way with the special counsel's investigation, whether by denying subpoenas, limiting the scope of the investigation, or restricting funding. He referred to the special counsel regulations and said he wanted to see Mueller finish his investigation. Again, that is not good enough--not with any President and certainly not with this one.  With this President, we need an Attorney General who can assure the Senate and the American public that he will stand up to a President who is dead set on protecting his political interests above all norms and rules of conduct. The President wants a Roy Cohn to be his Attorney General, but this moment calls for another Elliot Richardson.  The next Attorney General must be a public servant in the truest sense, with the integrity, the force of will, and the independence to navigate the Justice Department--and maybe our democracy--through treacherous waters.  Mr. Barr's attitude of ``leave it to me'' is not good enough--not for any nominee and certainly not for a nominee President Trump has chosen.  The authorship of the memo, followed by the inability to commit to release the report or let the investigation continue unimpeded--those are three strikes. Mr. Barr should be out. He does not recognize or appreciate the moment we are in. Again, his ``leave it to me'' attitude does not measure where we are with a President like this.  Now, I hope I am wrong. I hope Mr. Barr, who we know is likely to be confirmed--our Republican colleagues show none of the independence that is required--will rise to the occasion, but I remain unconvinced that Barr is prepared to meet this moment. So I will be voting, with strong conviction, no on this amendment. I hope Mr. Barr disproves my view, but his words make me very much worried that this will not happen.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of William Barr to be the next Attorney General of the United States of America.  Last Thursday, I voted against his nomination in the Senate Judiciary Committee, as did nine of my fellow Committee Members. I voted against his nomination because of some very serious concerns I have with his record on everything from criminal justice to environmental justice, to defending the economic rights of Americans, the rights of immigrants, LGBTQ rights, and women's rights.  I want to go through those concerns here on the floor today, but I also want to be clear that Mr. Barr has been nominated at a time of extraordinary challenge when it comes to defending rights in this country. This is a crisis.  We are in a moment in history when, after years of attacks on civil rights by this President and Attorney General Jeff Sessions, some of our most fundamental democratic principles--the rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection under the law--are hanging in the balance. We now face a full-blown crisis when it comes to rolling back the rights of Americans.  From community to community across the country, we see what it looks like when the Department of Justice fails to pursue justice for all Americans.  It looks like hate crimes in this country are on the rise for the third year in a row but a Department of Justice that rolls back protections for LGBTQ Americans instead of strengthening them.  It looks like more than one-third of all the LGBTQ youth in the country missing school because they feel unsafe but a DOJ that refuses to fight for them and protect them against State laws that target transgender students.  It looks like unchecked voter suppression of Black Americans in Georgia, Native Americans in North Dakota, and the voter ID and voter purge laws across the country that tried to target and suppress minority voters but a Justice Department that has stood by and failed to take on one single voting rights case during the last 2 years.  It looks like communities that are being poisoned by corporate polluters pushing their costs of doing business onto neighborhoods least able to defend themselves, making their land and air and water toxic but a DOJ that has made it easier for polluters to get settlement agreements while cutting its own enforcement capacity to hold those corporate polluters accountable.  It looks like corporate malfeasance continuing to target the most vulnerable while DOJ enforcement of corporate penalties drops by 90 percent during the first 2 years of the Trump administration.  It looks like doubling down on the failed war on drugs, which is known to be not a war on drugs but a war on the American people--disproportionately low-income Americans, disproportionately mentally ill Americans, disproportionately addicted Americans, and disproportionately Black and Brown people--which is exactly what Jeff Sessions did when he directed all Federal prosecutors to ``charge and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense'' and seek the highest penalties in nonviolent drug crimes.  It looks like unarmed Black men being killed by officers in their own homes and backyards, Americans of color being disproportionately stopped and arrested without adequate systems of accountability, but having a DOJ that limits the use of consent decrees that can prevent systemic abuses of power by law enforcement and can actually help to make law enforcement better, more accountable, more effective, rebuilding and repairing the trust between law enforcement and communities necessary to create safe and strong communities.  Of course, it looks like children fleeing violence, being ripped from the arms of their parents, of their mothers at the southern border, 6-year-olds being thrown into cages, and an untold number of children who still have not been reunited with their families because of the DOJ's so-called zero-tolerance policy.  Right now we see a Justice Department whose leadership over the past 2 years has failed countless communities, from low-income Americans who are being victimized by large corporations with bad actors to individual Americans who are trying to have their basic, fundamental rights protected.  The Justice Department has failed the American people, and, most of all, it has failed to seek that ideal we all hold dear, which is equal justice under the law. That is why, at this moment in history, during this crisis of conscience, during this crisis of moral leadership, we need an Attorney General who grasps the urgency of the moment, who is aware of the impact of the Department of Justice on communities across this country, and who is willing and prepared to protect our most fundamental rights in every community for every American. That is the ideal of justice; that is the ideal of patriotism.  What is patriotism but love of country? You cannot love your country unless you love your fellow country men and women. What does love look like in public? Justice, justice, justice.  I appreciate that Mr. Barr took the time to sit down and meet with me. It was after the hearings; yet at my request, he finally agreed to come and meet with me. There was no staff in the room. It was an honorable gesture--a gesture of courtesy. We had a chance to have dialogue about his record, his experiences, his perspectives as well as mine. I appreciate that. It is a constructive first step.  I appreciate his willingness to listen to me and talk about his record of mass incarceration. I even appreciate his willingness to accept the book I gave him--I hope he reads it--titled ``The New Jim Crow'' by Michelle Alexander.  I continue to have concerns about Mr. Barr's ability and willingness to be the kind of Attorney General this country needs at this pivotal moment in American history. I am concerned because throughout his career, time and again, and during his confirmation process, Mr. Barr has demonstrated not only that he holds troubling views but also that he has an alarming lack of knowledge about the crises that make our justice system so broken right now, at a time when the United States continues to lead the globe, to lead the planet Earth and all of humanity in the sheer number of people we incarcerate.  One out of every four people incarcerated on the planet Earth is right here in the United States, the land of the free. One out of every three incarcerated women on the planet Earth is right here in America, the land of the free. I say, again, that they are not the wealthy; they are not the privileged. As my friend Bryan Stevenson says: We have a nation that treats you better if you're rich and guilty than if you're poor and innocent.  Since 1980, our prison population in this country alone has grown on the Federal level by 800 percent. You can tell a lot about a nation by whom they incarcerate. In Russia they incarcerate political prisoners. In Turkey they incarcerate members of the media. In this country we incarcerate the poor. We incarcerate Americans with mental illnesses, Americans with disabilities, Americans who are survivors of sexual assault, Americans who are struggling with addiction, people who have faced harm and need help, who often in the system get hurt and experience retribution and not restorative justice. We have a nation where we are locking people up for doing things that two of the last three Presidents admitted to doing.  Mr. Barr has a record of actively pushing the policies that have led to mass incarceration, that have driven up our Nation's prison populations at a time when we need an Attorney General who is willing to follow the lead of this body, which passed criminal justice reform.  When Mr. Barr served as Attorney General during the first Bush administration, he literally wrote the book on mass incarceration. He commissioned a report titled ``The Case for More Incarceration'' and wrote the forward endorsing it. He is an architect of the criminal justice system that is so disproportionate--out of proportionality--that is ruthless, doing things that other countries, until this body acted, called torture, like juvenile solitary confinement.  At his hearing, Mr. Barr said he recognized that some things have changed over the last quarter century, but he failed to explain how his views on criminal justice have actually evolved. He was describing more of what he was seeing this body and others do, but he didn't talk about his own evolution. He didn't say: Hey, that was my perspective then, and it has changed now.  On the issue of implicit racial bias, I asked him if he acknowledged its well-documented existence in our criminal justice system. Implicit racial bias has been pointed out by both sides of the aisle in this body, by big city police chiefs and a former FBI Director. Time and again, it has been documented by university studies. It is actually in our Justice Department's policies to train people in implicit racial bias. This isn't something that is new. This is something we understand.  When asked about it, Mr. Barr said:       I have not studied the issue of implicit racial bias in our      criminal justice system. . . . Therefore, I have not become      sufficiently familiar with the issue to say whether such bias      exists.  I find this incredibly alarming. There are widely documented instances of racial disparities throughout our criminal justice system from police stops to sentencing, to charges. Racial bias exists even in our school pipeline; with Black kids and White kids having committed the same infractions in school, African-American kids are more likely to be suspended for them.  There is no difference, for example, between Blacks and Whites in the United States of America for using drugs--no differences for Blacks, Whites, Latinos. We have a drug problem in America, and it is equally seen, regardless of race. Whites are more likely than Blacks, in many studies, to deal drugs. Yet, despite this, we live in a country where Blacks are about three times more likely to be arrested for using drugs and almost four times more likely to be arrested for selling drugs.  What does it do when you apply a justice system to certain communities and not to others? It has a multiplier effect of impact. It affects voting rights because States still eliminate the right to vote for nonviolent drug charges. It is called felony disenfranchisement. It affects economic opportunity because if you have one criminal conviction for doing the same things that past Presidents have admitted to doing and Members of this body have admitted to doing, then you can't get a job, you can't get business licenses. Doors are shut to you; opportunity is closed. When you have a justice system that disproportionately impacts certain Americans, those communities then face serious, serious consequences.  As a Villanova study shows, overall, we would have about 20 percent less poverty in America if our incarceration rates were the same as those of our industrial peers. Poverty is more inflicted on those communities of color when they are more likely to be arrested, charged, and convicted because of the existence of implicit racial bias.  But the nominee for the top law enforcement position in our country says he is not sure ``whether such bias exists.''  This should be deeply troubling to all Americans because we believe in an ideal of equal justice under the law. This should be troubling to all Americans because we believe, as King said, ``Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.''  This should be deeply troubling to all Americans because there is a deep lack of faith that people have in our criminal justice system. They are losing faith that they will receive equal treatment.  When the justice system does not operate in good faith, it is hampered in doing its most sacred duty.  Right now there is a lack of belief that people will be treated fairly, a lack of belief that the system works the way it is supposed to. Mr. Barr's response and his record show me that he will do nothing to address these legitimate concerns in communities all across this country. At a time when he could be a leader, a champion, a light of justice and hope for those who have lost hope, for those who have lost faith, for those who feel left out and left behind, he almost doubles down with a dangerous lack of knowledge about what we all know exists.  If confirmed, Mr. Barr would also be charged with implementing what this body collectively has done to start to reform, for the first time in American history, mass incarceration and increased sentencing.  For the first time since 1994's crime bill, we in this body, with wisdom and in a bipartisan way, have started to go back to more proportionate sentencing. Through the FIRST STEP Act, this body put more justice back into our justice system. It is the first step, but it is the first step in the right direction in decades in our country's history.  I am proud of what we did together. The bipartisan criminal justice reform that this body just passed into law, by an overwhelming vote, is incredible, but it is critical that the FIRST STEP Act be fully and fairly implemented by the Justice Department. Mr. Barr has not demonstrated his commitment to the law or to fixing any part of the broken criminal justice system I have outlined.  Then, of course, we have industries, from the private prison industry to phone companies charging exorbitant fees in prisons and jails, making a profit off of these injustices, making a profit off policies that penalize and criminalize low-income communities and communities of color and that target refugees of color.  What is happening in our country's criminal justice system today is a human rights crisis. Think about a justice system right now that has people sitting in prison for months before they even get a trial because they can't afford bail or a lawyer. We have a human rights crisis in this country.  We need an Attorney General who recognizes the problem and has a willingness to do something about it, not one who says they are not sure we even have a crisis. This is an extraordinarily challenging time in our history. This Nation was formed under ideals of justice and fairness and equality. It was formed at a time when we mutually pledged to each other--as it says in our Declaration of Independence--``our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.'' This is a country where we are all in this together. This is a country where our values and ideals have to be real for all and not just a select few.  After 2 years, we have seen the Justice Department's relentless attacks on basic fundamental rights by our President and Attorney General. We now need an Attorney General who will work to uphold the values that are most in danger. We need an Attorney General who will fight for equal justice for all, not just the privileged few. We need an Attorney General who knows the difference between ensuring justice is done and does not automatically seek the harshest penalty in every case, with a blind eye to circumstances, or facts, or extenuating circumstances.  We need an Attorney General who will stand up for all of our children, LGBTQ rights, for voting rights, environmental justice, and a fairer justice system. We need an Attorney General who will refocus on the mission of the Department of Justice in seeking justice for every young person who is afraid to go to school because of prejudice and policies that discriminate. We need one who is seeking justice for every elderly man who lived through Jim Crow only to be blocked from exercising his voting rights because of racially targeted voter ID laws.  We need an Attorney General who is seeking justice for Americans who have become entrapped in our broken criminal justice system, whether it is a kid from a community like the one I live in who is being targeted by our ineffective drug laws or kids who have been picked up on the southern border and thrown into a privately run detention center.  We need an Attorney General who is seeking justice for communities whose soil, air, and water are being polluted by massive corporations and that feel no one will fight for them. We need an Attorney General who will live up to the purpose of the Justice Department. This is the call of our country. This is the leadership we need. This is the Attorney General we must insist on, one who will seek justice for everyone in every community from the gulf coast to the Great Lakes, from sea to shining sea.  Mr. Barr has not demonstrated that he understands the fierce urgency of this moment in our history and the imperative for the Attorney General to be deeply disturbed by injustice and to urgently seek justice. For this main reason, I will be voting against his nomination, but if confirmed, I will perform my constitutional duty and provide oversight and accountability. I will continue to work to ensure that our Justice Department lives up to its demands.  I hope this Attorney General, should he be confirmed, learns, sees the vulnerable, understands the challenges of the meek, and understands communities in crisis; that he gets to know people; that he reaches out and sits down with folks to learn and to develop a more courageous empathy, but I will not wait on that.  I will fight every day to make sure our Justice Department seeks justice. If Mr. Barr tries to double down on the failures of a broken criminal justice system, tries to roll back basic rights, or fails to protect voting rights and civil rights, I will fight against his efforts at every step. I will fight for justice that doesn't just take the side of the powerful few but seeks justice for all Americans. That is our obligation--all of us. Whether you sit in this body or you sit in communities across this country, we have gotten to where we are because we all sought justice. Even if it didn't affect our families directly, we knew the call of our country must be about all of us understanding that injustice for one is an injustice for all.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "topic":"Nominations",
                "speech":"Mr. President, in just a matter of hours, we are expected to vote on the nomination of William Barr to be Attorney General of the United States. This office is one of paramount importance to the people of this country, and as a former U.S. attorney, the chief Federal prosecutor in Connecticut, I have deep respect--indeed, reverence--for this office and the legal authority it commands and the moral powers it embodies.  So the stakes of this nomination, especially at this point in our history, could not be higher.  I believe William Barr should not be confirmed, and it has more to do with the role of the Attorney General of the United States than with his specific positions or policies on issues where we may disagree.  I do disagree with William Barr on positions he has taken on civil rights, women's healthcare, reproductive rights, and the powers of the Presidency.  At this moment in time, at this hour of our history, an imperial Presidency, such as envisioned by many of the doctrines that William Barr has espoused, in my view, would be an absolute catastrophe. Giving the President the power, in effect, to override statutes or refuse to enforce them or disregard Supreme Court precedent, especially with this President, would be a recipe for disaster.  An imperial Presidency at any point in our history is unwise. At this moment in our history, it would be catastrophic. That view of a unitary Executive and all that comes with it is one of the reasons I would have reservations about this nominee, but for me, the transcendent issue--as it was with Jeff Sessions, our former colleague--is whether this nominee will be the people's lawyer or the President's lawyer. Will he put first the interests of the American people or of President Donald Trump? Will he have foremost in mind the public interests or the personal interests of the President who appointed him?  Unfortunately, I am left with deep concerns, doubts, and questions that are disqualifying. The best example is his position on the release and disclosure of the special counsel's report. There were doubts--and there continue to be--among some of my colleagues about whether he will, in fact, allow the special counsel to do his job. He said that he would resist firing the special counsel and that he would allow Robert Mueller to finish his investigation, but he was pretty careful to avoid specifically committing that he would permit subpoenas to be issued, indictments to be brought, resources to be provided, and other essential factors that go into the effectiveness of the special counsel.  Even giving him the benefit of the doubt on those issues, there remains his refusal to commit that he will provide the evidence and findings of the special counsel directly to Congress and directly to the American people. For me, that refusal to commit is one of the factors that are disqualifying.  The American people want transparency for the special counsel, as they do in their government generally. Just yesterday, the Washington Post released a poll indicating that 81 percent of Americans believe the Mueller report should be released. That number includes 79 percent of Republicans. The simple, stark fact is, the public has a right to know. The American people paid for the special counsel's report. They deserve to know everything that is in it, and they deserve not only the conclusion but also the findings of fact and his prosecutorial decisions and the underlying evidence that he considered in making those decisions. The clear specter arises that he will choose to bring no indictment against the President or other officials and that there will be no disclosure of the report, which would be tantamount to a coverup. What we may be watching is the Saturday Night Massacre in slow motion.  The reason this issue is of such paramount importance to this nomination relates to the obligation that the Attorney General has to promote transparency. In his responses to me, he said he would follow all the rules and regulations without delving into all the words and technical issues relating to those rules and regulations. The simple fact is, they provide near complete discretion to the Attorney General.  The American public has a right to see the Mueller report, not the Barr report. We have a right to see not what William Barr in his discretion permits us to know but, in fact, what the findings and evidence are--the Mueller report, not the Barr report. My fear is that despite his very vague references to wanting transparency, his refusal to commit to making that report public reveals his state of mind: that he will abridge, edit, conceal, redact parts of the report that may be embarrassing to the President. In effect, he will act as the President's lawyer, not as the people's lawyer.  During a hearing, I asked William Barr point blank, if he were presented with evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the President committed a crime, would he approve an indictment. He declined to answer the question directly or clearly. He pointed to two Office of Legal Counsel opinions saying that a sitting President cannot be indicted. I asked what he thought, not what the OLC thought. Would he permit an indictment against a President if presented with incontrovertible evidence of criminal wrongdoing? And he said he saw no reason to change the policy embodied in those OLC memos. The assumption is wildly held that Robert Mueller will follow those OLC memos, and William Barr confirmed those assumptions.  There is also Department of Justice policy that prosecutors do not speak publicly about people they are investigating but are not prepared to indict. I followed those policies as U.S. attorney. I know them well. In the normal case, they are fully applicable, but these two policies taken in combination lead to a truly frightening outcome: If the President cannot be indicted but has committed crimes, the American people may never know. That is, in effect, tantamount to a coverup. The American people may never know about that proof beyond a reasonable doubt. They may never see those findings in evidence. They may never have the benefit of the full report. Even though it may leak in dribs and drabs, in parts, they will never have the full and complete picture.  That is why I believe so strongly in the legislation that Senator Grassley and I have offered to require transparency. It is called the Special Counsel Transparency Act. It would require that there be a report. If the special counsel is transferred or fired or if he resigns or at any point completes his investigation, there would be a report, and it would be required that that report be provided to the American people. It would be mandatory, not discretionary.  I believe this issue is a transcendent one in this era--the public's right to know the truth about the 2016 election and the President's responsibility for any obstruction of justice or any collusion with the Russians. Again, it is about the public's right to know and about the Attorney General's responsibility for enabling the public's right to know. His answers were evasive and deeply troubling, and instead of providing straightforward and forthcoming answers, he was, in effect, evading and avoiding the question.  In addition to the special counsel's investigation, there are at least two U.S. Attorney's Offices--the Southern District of New York and the Eastern District of Virginia--that have concurrent investigations into Trump campaign activities during this same period of time and beyond. In the Southern District of New York, the President has been essentially named as an unindicted coconspirator. He is individual No. 1, an unindicted coconspirator. That is a distinction he shares with only one other President--Richard Nixon.  The unencumbered continuation of these investigations is of vital public interest. That is why I asked Mr. Barr whether he would impose any restrictions on these prosecutors. Again his answer was evasive and deeply troubling. Instead of issuing a simple no, he stated that the Attorney General has the responsibility and discretion to supervise U.S. attorneys, and he declined to say that he would defer to them. He declined in the hearing, and he did again in our private meeting. That answer gives me no confidence that, if confirmed, William Barr will avoid interfering in the investigations now underway in those two additional jurisdictions, where, in fact, they may pose an even more dire danger that his culpability will be revealed and perhaps prosecuted. It should not give the public any greater degree of confidence either.  On other issues--the emoluments clause, for example. When I asked him, he said: I haven't even looked up the word ``emolument.'' That is a direct quote. There are a number of very high-profile cases against the President involving the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution because the President has been violating it. The chief anti-corruption provision in Federal law is the emoluments clause. Litigation is underway. Decisions have been rendered in the district courts in favor of the standing of 200 of us Members of Congress who have challenged the President's lawbreaking. I am proud that that case--Blumenthal v. Trump; Blumenthal and Nadler v. Trump--is proceeding. William Barr has a responsibility to know about that case and to say whether he would recuse himself from it since he was appointed by the defendant in that case, and if not, what justification there can be for continuing to make decisions about it.  Again, William Barr is a distinguished attorney. He has a strong background and qualifications. He served in this position before. He has very impressive credentials. He and I differ on issues of policy, but the main question relates to disclosure and transparency, to fidelity and priority, to the American people's interests--putting them unquestionably above the President's. Because I have such deep reservations and concerns about his determination to do so, I will oppose him as Attorney General, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, once again, I stand here on behalf of our hard-working and patriotic coal miners. We have been here before, and we are going to stay here until we get the job done.  Right now, retired coal miners' healthcare, pensions, and black lung benefits are on the chopping block again, and, once again, there are 1,200 new coal miners and dependents who will lose their healthcare coverage due to coal company bankruptcies. This could happen later this month if the court, as expected, allows Westmoreland to shed their Coal Act liabilities.  This has happened time after time because of the bankruptcy laws--the inadequate bankruptcy laws--to protect the hard-working men and women who do all the work.  At the end of last year, Westmoreland indicated they would provide 8 months of healthcare funding to the UMWA, but there was a condition. It was dependent upon the sale of certain mines for which they have received no qualified bids, according to documents filed in court.  Our broken bankruptcy laws are about to let another coal company shirk their responsibilities and get out of paying for healthcare and pensions the coal miners have earned and deserved. They have worked for this. They have negotiated. They are not asking for a handout. They are asking to get what they paid for, what they negotiated for, and what they didn't take home to their families.  We have to keep our promise that was signed into law in the Krug-Lewis agreement. This goes back to 1946--1946. It is the only one of its kind. The agreement makes sure we protect our patriotic coal miners' healthcare and pensions.  We have the chance today to pass my bill that was cosponsored with my colleagues, the American Miners Act, that will ensure that none of these coal miners or their beneficiaries would lose their healthcare, pensions, or black lung benefits.  The American Miners Act uses the same funding mechanism that the Miners Protection Act did to protect retired miners' healthcare. It is the same funding mechanism Congress has used time and again to protect our miners' hard-earned healthcare after our bankruptcy courts have ripped them away. This is not going to be a drain on the Treasury. It does not cost the taxpayers money. We have pay-fors, and this will be taken care of, as we have taken care of our healthcare benefits.  I am asking you to keep the promise just the way we did when we passed the Miners Protection Act and saved the healthcare for 22,600 miners. We need to finish this job. Save the healthcare of these miners suffering from new bankruptcies, protect the pensions of 87,000 miners nationwide, and do it by passing the American Miners Act, which would also ensure the future of the Black Lung Trust Fund, a lifeline for the growing number of miners with black lung.  I don't know if you all understand the background or if you have heard about what happened, but with the passage of the bills we are working on, it cuts the black lung fund from $1.10 down to 50 cents. You would think that if you were reducing it, we had found a cure, and there is less need for the money to save our coal miners and to heal them. That is contrary to what is happening. If anything, it is exacerbating, and it is growing quicker, faster, and younger people are getting this horrible disease more than ever before.  What we are asking for--my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--is to join us here today to demonstrate our commitment to our promise. That is all it is.  I am asking the President of the United States, President Trump, please join in, Mr. President. I know you know the miners. I know you have spoken eloquently about the miners and your support for the miners. This is one way to truly support the miners, to make sure they get what they worked for and what they have earned--what they worked for and what they have earned. We have it paid for. It does not add one penny to the Nation's debt. Everything is ready to go. Please call Senator McConnell and tell him to put this on the agenda. You put it on the agenda, Mr. President, and you have Senator McConnell put in the amendment--a Senator from Kentucky who has an awful lot of coal miners in his State also. I will assure you we will get it passed, and we will do the job we should have done a long time ago for the people and families who have given everything they have, who have patriotically committed themselves to the energy this country has needed, and who have defended this country every step of the way.  With that, I yield to my friend from Ohio, Senator Brown."

I think Senator Casey will be here in a few minutes. I join them to remind this body--it is a constant reminder--that more than 86,000 miners--86,000 miners--are on the verge of facing massive cuts to the pensions and healthcare they earned.  This body doesn't always remember what collective bargaining is all about. Collective bargaining is when union members sit down and give up wages today to have something for the future, to have healthcare and to have retirement in the future.  Of those 86,000 miners, 1,200 miners and their families could lose their healthcare this month because of the Westmoreland and Mission Coal bankruptcies. The bankruptcy courts could allow these corporations to ``shed their liabilities,'' which is a fancy way of saying walk away from paying miners the pensions and the healthcare benefits they absolutely earned.  Senator Manchin is working to fix this. I thank him for his efforts, and I thank others in this body. We know the mine workers aren't alone. The retirement security of hundreds of thousands of teamsters, ironworkers, carpenters, bakery workers, and so many other retirees is at risk.  We know this affects, in my State alone, 250 businesses, mostly small construction and transportation companies, 60,000 workers in my State alone, and the health of communities. Mine worker communities are especially hurt by this because so many of them live in the same community--local stores and local businesses.  As we know, Congress pretty much tried to ignore these workers and these retirees. Senator Manchin and I saw that day after day and week after week, but they fought back. We saw workers rally. They rallied in very hot weather on the Capitol lawn, and they rallied in very cold weather on the Capitol lawn. They rallied. They called. They wrote letters. We have seen those camo UMWA T-shirts around the Capitol. Many of them are veterans. They fought for their country. We owe it to them to fight for them.  We made progress on the bipartisan Pensions Committee that Senator Manchin and I sat on. Thanks to Senator Portman, also from my State, and members of both parties who put in months of good work in good faith on this.  I am committed to these miners and workers. We will not give up. That is why I brought Rita Lewis as my guest to the State of the Union Address down the hall last week. Rita Lewis is the widow of Butch Lewis, the teamster who died from a heart attack a couple of years ago, in large part, we think--she thinks, his family thinks brought on by the pressure of fighting for his union, his Teamsters 100--1 million members around the country.  It is about the dignity of work. When work has dignity, we honor the retirement security people have earned.  As I said, people in this town don't always understand the collective bargaining process. People give up money today to earn those pensions. If you love your country, you fight for people who make it work, people like these mineworkers."

                "speech":"Madam President, I am really pleased to be here to join in the colloquy with my fellow Senators, Mr. Manchin, Senator Brown from Ohio, and Senator Warner from Virginia.  This is important. This is really important. I could say I look around the room, and it is important to us, but it is important even more granularly to some other folks who are right here watching what we are doing.  Many of us have worked together previously in order to save retiree health benefits for 22,000 retired miners in 2017, following the bankruptcies of Patriot, Alpha, and Walter Resources. Today we are back together to advocate for another over 1,000 retirees and beneficiaries whose healthcare is impacted by the Westmoreland Coal bankruptcy, as Senator Manchin described.  It is also critical that we redouble our efforts to find a solution to the 1974 UMWA Pension Fund. If we do nothing--if we do nothing, which I don't believe is an option--this pension fund, which provides 83,000 current beneficiaries with their pensions, will be insolvent by 2022. That is getting close, and insolvency can come even sooner, depending on market conditions.  So combined with the 20,000 people who have a vested right to future benefits, more than 100,000 people are covered by this pension plan. As Senator Manchin said, these are hard-working people who were promised and who, in the course of their working lives, gave up something so they could have a better peace of mind later on. They worked hard day in and day out. They powered our communities and industries and helped our country achieve greatness, even in the toughest times, and they did that with the promise of healthcare and a pension that would allow them to live with dignity in retirement.  We are not talking about lavish pensions. I think this is an important point. The average benefit paid by this fund is $560 per month. These retirees are not getting rich on their pension plans, and they are not taking lavish expenditures, but without this monthly benefit, many of them would be living on the edge of poverty, if they are not already.  One miner from Logan, WV, who worked in the mines for 36 years wrote:       Please keep fighting for our pension. I receive $303.34      monthly. We need this badly to help pay for food, medicine,      and other bills.  Another retired miner from Richwood, WV, who worked in the mines for 17 years, wrote that his monthly check of $192 ``is not a lot of money, but it means a lot,'' and on top of that, he earned it. It helps him make his ends meet.  Another miner from Kistler, WV, who mined for over 35 years, expressed concern that he might not be able to pay his expenses or help his daughter in college without that monthly pension check.  Failing to fix the pension fund would have a terrible impact on communities where many of these miners live. More than 25,000 pension fund beneficiaries live in the State of West Virginia, and they received $200 million in benefits last year. If they didn't spend that money in their community supporting businesses and other jobs in our coalfield communities--if you subtract those funds out of the community, you would have a significant economic blow.  We have a solution that will prevent the insolvency of the pension fund and protect our retired miners, their families, and their communities. We should pass legislation that expands the use of the same transfer of payments used to support retiree healthcare to make the pension fund solvent. I have supported various forms of that kind of legislation over the years, but as we come closer to the time--2022--when the pension fund will become insolvent, we must redouble our efforts. That is why I appreciate Senator Manchin's advocacy. I appreciate his sense of urgency, and I share that.  At the same time, our West Virginia representatives, along with representatives from the States--David McKinley, Alex Mooney, and Carol Miller--are leading a bipartisan effort in the House to fix this problem as well.  I will keep fighting alongside all of you and all of them and others I see until we enact a solution that keeps the promise of our hard-working coal miners.  Thank you.  I yield back."

                "speech":"First of all, Madam President, I want to thank my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Capito, for her comments. I know shortly we are going to hear from the Senator from Pennsylvania. We heard from the Senator from Ohio.  This is sometimes hard for me to say as a former Governor of Virginia to a former Governor of West Virginia, but I want particularly those who are following this issue to know that no one in this body has fought for miners harder, longer, more passionately, more consistently than Joe Manchin.  It was only through his repeated efforts--and this man is like a dog with a bone in his mouth who will not let it go. At times he is stiff in the spine with folks on this side of the aisle when they wanted to say: Well, maybe no. We ought to move to something else. He has come back and back and back again.  So I am honored to stand with him one more time. Let me again say that it is with some challenge that someone from the Commonwealth of Virginia has to say these many nice things about somebody from West Virginia, but the folks in the Gallery ought to know there has been no one who has been a better advocate for miners than the Senator from West Virginia.  I don't think there is a Member of the Senate--I know at least on this side of the aisle--who has not heard at least a half dozen times about the promises Harry Truman made to the miners in 1946 and how it is our obligation to keep that word and to keep that promise.  The Senator from West Virginia has indicated why this is timely. Again, it is because we have the challenges around the pension fund. We have other challenges, but we have a crisis right now.  We talked about Westmoreland--the Westmoreland bankruptcy, 1,200 miners, 500 of those live in Virginia. If we can't get a solution on this deal right now on the American Miners Act, then a lot of those miners and their families are going to go bankrupt because their day of reckoning is already upon us.  I want to echo what the Senator from West Virginia said to urge the majority leader and, for that matter, the minority leader that there is a way--if we do the rational, sensible thing and not shut down the government on Friday, we ought to take advantage of making sure the American Miners Act is part of that provision. I can think of nothing better, as we go into the work period, than to try to give miners some certainty.  Let me just mention one other item that the American Miners Act had, and that is the strengthening of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund. This is also an issue that, if we don't get it resolved, the amount of contributions that go into that trust fund will drop in half.  I don't think many folks realize--and I think this is particularly the case in West Virginia and Southwest Virginia--black lung is still a real, enormous medical challenge. As a matter of fact, we have now seen growth in large populations in my State, and I know in West Virginia, as well, of advanced black lung cases called complicated black lung, which has an even more devastating effect.  If this trust fund is cut in half, based upon legislation that took place at the end of calendar year 2018, the ability of the trust fund to meet the needs of these miners and their families, who are still hard hit by a debilitating disease--we are not going to be able to give them, again, the high-quality care they deserve. It is way past time to fix this problem. Let's take that step.  We have one of these large pieces of legislation, hopefully, that the President will not decide to veto, that we will get through. Wouldn't it be--I ask the Senator from West Virginia this before I cede to the Senator from Pennsylvania, but sometimes, with these giant bills, strange things pop out at the end of the day, and you kind of wonder how they got in. Wouldn't it be great if, on this mini giant bill, one of the things that popped out might be the promised relief for our miners in terms of healthcare and their pensions? This is something I believe, we, as a country, owe to the miners--back, yes, to President Truman's promise in 1946.  I stand with all of my colleagues on this issue. I particularly thank, again, my friend the Senator from West Virginia for his great leadership and his willingness to stand tall time and again. Let's see if we can get it done this time.  With that, Madam President, I yield to the Senator from West Virginia."

                "speech":"Madam President, I thank the senior Senator from West Virginia for his time today, but, more importantly, as the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, said, Senator Manchin has fought harder than anyone in this Chamber on behalf of men and women, whether they are coal miners or their families or their spouses.  This is a very simple debate. It is not a debate about some far-off, complex issue. This is about a promise--a promise that was made to coal miners and their families in the 1940s.  The only question--a real simple question--is that we are either going to keep the promise or not. It is as simple as that. Both parties, both Houses, and the administration--this is not complicated. We made substantial progress, but it took far too long, and there are some people in this Chamber who have been blocking it for far too long on healthcare. We got that done. That is the good news.  The bad news is, the pension issue is still unresolved. There is still a lot of suffering, a lot of uncertainty, a lot of trauma because two branches of government haven't done enough for these families.  I come from a State where large portions of our State were dependent upon the sweat and the blood of working men and women, especially coal miners. Stephen Crane, the great novelist, wrote an essay in the early 1900s--actually late 1800s--about all of the dangers in a coal mine and all of the ways a miner could die. He described the mine as a place of ``inscrutable darkness'' and ``a soundless place of tangible loneliness.'' That is how he described the work of the coal miner.  I know we made progress in the intervening generation since then, but that work has always been difficult. It has always been dark and dangerous, but the people who did it kept their promise. They kept their promise to their employer to work every day and kept their promise to their family. Many of them kept their promise to their country when they served in World War II or Korea or Vietnam or any conflict after that, even up to the present day--but especially those who were serving in those years.  The only question is whether this government and all of us here--and both parties are on the hook here--whether we are going to keep our promise along with this administration and any future administration. It is as simple as that.  We have some work to do here to make sure that promise is fulfilled. These families, these miners have already kept their promise. They are done. This isn't something extra we are giving them.  All we are doing is our part. We are obligated here, and I am grateful that the senior Senator from West Virginia and others have worked together to make sure that this issue is front and center, even as we are dealing with a range of other issues.  I yield the floor."

This has been a bipartisan movement. This has been bipartisan. I thank all of my Republican colleagues for supporting the hard-working people they all had in their States.

It does not cost the government one penny of debt--not one penny of debt for the taxpayers. We have pay-fors. It has been bipartisan. It came out of the Finance Committee in a bipartisan movement under the leadership of Senator Hatch. I am very grateful for that.

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today to support the Air Force's plan to expand the 386 operational squadrons.  Since the earliest days of flight, the United States has been an aviation leader. From the time of the U.S. Army Air Corps through today's modern U.S. Air Force, our Nation has always been at the forefront of air combat.  From air-to-air combat to aerial refueling, to the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance conducted by the planes of Nebraska's own 55th Wing, the U.S. Air Force is renowned as the dominant force in the sky.  Recent developments have put that advantage at risk. Around the world, nations are rapidly modernizing their capabilities by investing millions in their air forces and air defenses, threatening our ability to claim and maintain air superiority.  Rapid advances in anti-access/area-denial technology and a coordinated, calibrated effort by nations like China and Russia pose a significant threat to our ability to operate in contested airspace.  For decades, we have been accustomed to flying unconstrained, fighting adversaries on the ground that lack modern technology and the ability to seriously threaten our freedom to conduct aerial missions.  The face of 21st century warfare is changing. Competitors are rapidly closing the gap, and while our Air Force remains the most professional and effective air combat force in the world, these nations are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into matching and exceeding our capability.  We have a choice. If we fail to react, we risk falling behind and losing the air dominance that has been essential to U.S. national security for decades. We cannot sit back and accept that possibility.  We must meet this challenge head-on. The United States must adapt, invest, and show the world that we will never cede control of the skies to our enemies.  Recently, the Air Force conducted a rigorous analysis of future air combat scenarios that we could face in the coming decades. Utilizing over 2,000 simulations based on the latest intelligence to assess force performance against strategic competitors, the Air Force produced a model of the requirements necessary to fulfill the goals of the national defense strategy.  This analysis found that we will need an array of advanced capabilities to counter ongoing and robust military modernization by our competitors. The assessment determined that we must focus our own modernization around several key areas to ensure our continued ability to defend the homeland and to defeat strategic threats.  Perhaps most critically, this analysis, which the Air Force calls ``the Air Force We Need,'' has determined that to be effective in achieving these goals, we must grow the Air Force to 386 operational squadrons.  Given the growing threats we face, the Air Force will play a key role in any future conflict. That is why I believe it is imperative that we act on this analysis and align the necessary resources to bridge the gap between the Air Force we have and the Air Force we need and reach that goal of 386 squadrons.  The need to grow the Air Force is not some arbitrary desire for more planes. The reality is that, even today, our Air Force is too small, and it is stretched too thin to properly execute all of its missions.  Right now, the Air Force has 39 percent fewer aircraft and 58 percent fewer combat-coded fighter squadrons than it did during Operation Desert Storm, and it is struggling to maintain a rapidly aging fleet. All the while, Russia and China continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars into new technology and equipment that is designed to seize control of the sky.  That is why it is imperative that we act to provide the resources necessary to grow to 386 operational squadrons. We simply cannot face these challenges with one of the smallest Air Forces we have ever had. That is a recipe for disaster. It is a recipe for defeat.  Instead, we must rebuild the fleet. We must increase flying hours, improve training, add pilots and maintainers, and retain the best airmen we have. We have to act now, without delay.  While the ``Air Force We Need'' adds significantly to the physical capability of our Air Force, it is about more than simply adding equipment to the flight line. This plan will also modernize the way we fight. With an increased focus on ``jointness'' and integration with advanced technology like unmanned systems and artificial intelligence, we can continue adapting to stay ahead of our enemies, all of whom have spent years watching and learning from us in the field.  As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I commend the Air Force for putting forward a bold vision for the future. I believe if we truly are to execute the goals of the national defense strategy, this is the kind of analysis and planning that has to happen, and it must be followed by action from Congress.  That is why I urge my colleagues in the Senate to join me in supporting a robust defense budget and investing in the enhanced capability the Air Force needs to continue its mission of protecting the American people.  At this critical juncture in the Nation's history and amid a fundamental shift in the type of threats we face, now is not the time to let partisanship get in the way of what must be done to continue supporting our airmen and maintainers. Let's work together so that we can build the Air Force that we need so that, above all else, the world knows that the U.S. Air Force will never allow any adversary to dictate how, when, and where we fly.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak regarding the nomination of William Barr to serve as the next Attorney General of our country.  First, I want to take a few minutes to reflect on the circumstances surrounding this vacancy. I believe that every Member of this Chamber should use this occasion to decide, ultimately, whether we believe Mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for all Americans or whether Mr. Barr will be the Attorney General, really, for one American.  When President-elect Trump selected then-Senator Jeff Sessions, our colleague from Alabama, to serve as Attorney General for this country, it brought me no joy to vote against our long-time colleague and friend. The truth was, though, that our views too often diverged on too many important issues that included immigration, healthcare, civil rights, voting rights, LGBT rights, environmental protection, and more.  After considerable prayer and reflection, I reached the conclusion that Senator Sessions would not be an Attorney General for all Americans.  Unfortunately, during his tenure at the Department of Justice, he went on to preside over a number of divisive policies and decisions, including the Muslim ban, overturning protections for Dreamers and asylum seekers, enacting a cruel policy of family separation at our southern border, and failing to defend the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in court.  I have not been shy about expressing my disagreement with these decisions, and others, made by the Department of Justice during the current administration. However, one area where I strongly agreed with Attorney General Sessions was his decision to recuse himself from the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in our 2016 elections.  One of my core values is to figure out what is the right thing to do and to try to do it--not what is politically expedient, not what is easy but what is the right thing to do. After it became clear that then-Senator Sessions provided testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee that called into question his impartiality on matters relating to Russia and the 2016 election, Attorney General Sessions recused himself from all matters related to the 2016 Presidential election. That was the right thing to do. It certainly wasn't what our President wanted him to do. The President has said as much repeatedly. I should say that, maybe, he has tweeted as much repeatedly.  The President repeatedly admonished Attorney General Sessions for doing what I think many of us believe was the right thing to do. Here is what the President tweeted on June 5, 2018:       The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff      Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself . . .      I would have quickly picked someone else. So much time and      money wasted, so many lives ruined . . . and Sessions knew      better than most that there was No Collusion!  Let me be clear, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation is not a witch hunt. It is, in fact, the unanimous opinion of the U.S. intelligence Agencies and law enforcement community that Russia attacked our democracy and interfered in our 2016 elections.  As a result of the special counsel's ongoing investigation, 34 individuals and 3 companies have been indicted or pled guilty to a range of crimes. This includes the Trump campaign manager, the Trump deputy campaign manager, Mr. Trump's National Security Advisor, and, most recently, President Trump's longtime political advisor.  Special Counsel Mueller is a lifelong Republican who served with distinction in the Vietnam war. I think I am the last Member of this body who served in the Vietnam war, but he served there with real distinction. He served with distinction as our FBI Director following the September 11 attacks. He is not conducting a partisan witch hunt. He and the team he leads are striving to find out the truth and, in doing so, help us prevent future attacks on our democracy.  I believe we should be doing everything in our power to allow Special Counsel Mueller and his team to conduct and complete this investigation free from political interference and partisan games.  During the years I was privileged to serve as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Bob Mueller was the head of the FBI. I had a chance to work with him and to get to know him. My wife and I know his wife. He is among the finest people I have ever known in the military, outside of the military, in government service, and outside of government service.  Unfortunately, President Trump does not view political independence as a prerequisite for the job of Attorney General. Instead, he tends to view political independence as a disloyal act, an offense for which one should be fired. Just ask former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates. Just ask former FBI Director Comey, whom I also came to know well during the time I served on the Homeland Security Committee, including as its chairman. Just ask former Attorney General Sessions.  Recall with me, if you will, after the November election, President Trump fired Attorney General Sessions and named the Attorney General's Chief of Staff, Matt Whitaker, as Acting Attorney General. This was a curious decision, as well as a legally questionable decision. Why would the President go outside the line of succession at the Department of Justice? I fear it is because of Mr. Whitaker's public comments regarding the Mueller investigation.  Mr. Whitaker previously likened the special counsel's investigation to a ``fishing expedition,'' and a ``witch hunt'' and implied that following the truth ``could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family--and by extension, to our country.''  Really? Could he have been serious in saying that getting to the bottom of all this could be damaging to the President of the United States and his family and, by extension, to our country?  Another President, a long time ago, Thomas Jefferson, used to say these words: If the people know the truth, they won't make a mistake.  Those are hardly the views of our current President. It saddens me to say that.  Despite publicly expressing these views that clearly call into question his impartiality, Mr. Whitaker did not recuse himself from the Mueller investigation when he assumed of the role of Acting Attorney General, even though he received a recommendation to recuse himself from ethics officials at the Department of Justice.  Mr. Whitaker's staggering unfitness for the job is a big part of the reason why my initial reaction was positive when President Trump nominated William Barr to be our Attorney General. After all, Mr. Barr previously served as Deputy Attorney General and Attorney General during the administration of George Herbert Walker Bush, someone I revered. I think many of us revered him.  By all accounts, Mr. Barr is a well-qualified nominee, someone who has been a fine public servant throughout many years of public service. I strongly believe that we need Senate-confirmed leadership at the Department of Justice. I want to make it clear that during normal times, I might be inclined to support Mr. Barr's nomination. In fact, I probably would.  But these are not normal times. These are extraordinary times. In addition to firing the Attorney General and the FBI Director for their views on the Russia inquiry, President Trump has reportedly asked those around him why he didn't have an Attorney General who is looking out for his personal interests. According to reports, the President has said, ``Where's my Roy Cohn?'' during moments of crisis. For those who may not know Roy Cohn, he was President Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, who pushed legal tactics to the limits and also served with Senator Joe McCarthy during a very dark period in our Nation's history and a very dark period in this Senate's history.  This is how President Trump views the role of Attorney General--not as a lawyer to defend the rights of all Americans but as a fixer who will look out for him. Moreover, in his State of the Union address last week, President Trump highlighted what he sees as ``ridiculous, partisan investigations.'' He went on to say: ``If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigations.''  It is against this extraordinary backdrop that we must ask ourselves: What are Mr. Barr's views on Presidential power, and what are his views on the investigation led by Robert Mueller?  As it turns out, we don't have to guess what the answer is to that question. In an unsolicited 19-page memo that Mr. Barr sent to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and President Trump's personal lawyers, Mr. Barr shares his views, and they are clearly hostile to the special counsel's investigation.  In a memo entitled ``Mueller's Obstruction Theory,'' Mr. Barr raises doubt about the special counsel's ability to follow the truth while going on to defend President Trump's actions and even suggesting that the President has the power to limit the scope of this inquiry.  In that same memo, Mr. Barr states that the special counsel's investigation into obstruction of justice may do ``lasting damage to the presidency.''  I believe that reasonable people can disagree, as I frequently did with my friend, former Senator, and then-Attorney General, Jeff Sessions.  It is clear to me, however, that despite whatever your views may be toward the special counsel's investigation, the views expressed in his memo not only warrant Mr. Barr's recusal from the special counsel's investigation, but they cry out for it.  Attorney General Sessions did the right thing when confronted with a similar decision. However, despite expressing these biased views from President Trump's own personal lawyers, Mr. Barr says he will not recuse himself from the special counsel's investigation if he is confirmed. To make matters worse, Mr. Barr refuses to commit to making the special counsel's final report public.  Earlier, I asked for us to consider whether Mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for all Americans or whether Mr. Barr will be the Attorney General for one American. That one American happens to go by another name, Individual 1, which is the legal moniker given to President Trump in the Southern District of New York for directing his personal attorney to violate Federal campaign finance law.  Like Mr. Whitaker's public comments prior to his elevation to Acting Attorney General, I fear that Mr. Barr's memo may have been an audition for the job and that his selection may not have been a coincidence. During his Senate hearing in 1989, Mr. Barr plainly stated that the Attorney General ``is the President's lawyer.''  Colleagues, these are extraordinary times for our Nation. We must make it clear to the American people that the Attorney General is not the President's lawyer. We need independence at the Department of Justice now more than ever. While I hope I am wrong--very wrong--it is my belief that Trump used this appointment as an opportunity to protect himself rather than to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.  Ultimately, for all of these reasons I have laid out, I have concluded that despite his earlier service to our Nation--distinguished service in many instances--Mr. Barr does not, in this instance, meet the standard that is necessary to be the Attorney General for our country now.  Sadly, on that note, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in the next 24 hours, the Senate will do what it should do, which is to actually go through the process of advice and consent with a nominee--this time, for an Attorney General--William Barr.  William Barr is eminently qualified. It has been interesting to hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk all day long today about how qualified William Barr is but then always pause with a ``but'' and take off on the Mueller investigation.  Let me explain what this means by ``eminently qualified.'' He has had an exceptionally impressive legal career. He serves in one of the top U.S. firms. He began his legal career decades ago as, actually, an analyst and as legislative counsel for the CIA. He worked on domestic policy for Ronald Reagan. He served as the Deputy Attorney General from 1990 to 1991, and then he served as the Attorney General of the United States for George Herbert Walker Bush from 1991 to 1993.  When he was appointed as the Attorney General in 1991, his nomination passed out of the Judiciary Committee with a unanimous vote of 14 to 0. The Judiciary chairman at the time--a gentleman named Joe Biden--called him a fine Attorney General. He was overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate in 1991--a less partisan time. It was when Democrats and Republicans both looked at his qualifications, not at a political agenda.  We have a unique moment in which to look at someone who was a good Attorney General for the United States, one who served faithfully but then had a season away from that, only to turn around and do it again. How many of us wouldn't want to redo something we did years ago and say: I did it, and it went well, but if I were to have a little more time and could do it over again, I would do things better. We have that chance with William Barr. It is a unique moment for us as a nation to be able to bring somebody like that back again.  What happened under his watch?  During that time period, he believed and still believes that the personal security of the citizens of the United States is the primary, first duty of the government's and of the U.S. Attorney General's. Despite what is being smeared about him on this floor over and over again--with people saying he is being hired to be the President's personal attorney--for those who have actually met with him and talked with him, he speaks openly about law enforcement in the United States. He talks about working with local law enforcement and with U.S. attorneys to actually prosecute crime and go after the issues that distract from American values and that keep the American people from living the American dream.  During his tenure as Attorney General, he spearheaded the initiative called the Weed and Seed Program, which removed violent drug offenders from the streets. Under Attorney General Barr, in the 1990s, violent crime in the United States went down because they were aggressively prosecuting for crime.  He is also the Attorney General who supervised the enforcement and implementation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. It was an incredibly difficult legal process to have gone through and to have implemented nationwide in order to have protected the rights of individuals who had been overlooked in our country for two centuries--those with disabilities. It was a major feature of what he did during that time period.  He brings this unique, important perspective from his dealings with law enforcement, his background, his experience. All of those things look like they would make a slam dunk with which to come to this floor and have wide, bipartisan support except for this--that he is being used as a message in the Mueller investigation. It is not that he said: I am going to stop the Mueller investigation. It is not that he said anything else about that. He did write a 19-page letter as an attorney in the law practice that is helping President Trump get through this process.  He wrote: Hey, as former Attorney General, here are all of the things of which you should be advised. When you are working with the President, here are the key features.  It seems like a kind thing to do for any President. He wrote the letter with all of that information in it, and he gave those details. Fine.  He has also said over and over again that he is not going to undercut the Mueller investigation. Yet some of my Democratic colleagues have said: No, it has to be more than that. He has to recuse himself like Jeff Sessions did. He has to recuse himself. If he doesn't recuse himself, he can't be there.  May I remind you that the reason Jeff Sessions had to recuse himself was that he was on the campaign team for the President, and when he got into the position of Attorney General, the ethics team from the Department of Justice advised him: Hey, since you were on the campaign team, you can't be the investigator for the campaign team. At that time, Attorney General Jeff Sessions agreed and said that it would violate ethics for a person on the team to help investigate the team, so he recused himself. That was not William Barr. There is all of this talk that he has to recuse himself like Jeff Sessions did, but it is a completely different situation. Why should he recuse himself?  Apparently, people don't want the Mueller investigation to have any supervision, which, again, I find fascinating politically because I distinctly remember, during the Clinton administration, that many of my Democratic colleagues who are still in this Chamber now were furious with Ken Starr. They can't believe Donald Trump would say he is frustrated with the Mueller team, but they had no problem with the Clinton White House's literally saying: We are going to go to war against Ken Starr. The term ``witch hunt'' is not new. The Clinton administration used that same term against Ken Starr. This is a fascinating side-by-side to me, to be able to look at this.  Here is what I would advise: Let the Mueller investigation finish its job. It has a job. Let it do its job. Quite frankly, the Attorney General shouldn't be in the day-to-day operations of the Mueller investigation. That is why we have a special counsel. Yet, at some point, the special counsel has to turn information over to someone. William Barr is not going to be the one writing all of the information from the special counsel. He should neither have this incredibly high standard nor be held to some standard of doing something that he is not going to do--try to interfere in this process. He has made that very clear.  He has also made it very clear verbally, in committee settings, and in written statements that he is going to release whatever comes out, as under the law, from the Mueller investigation. I think some people believe that the Mueller investigation is going to release a big, giant written report like the Senate Intel Committee will do. Yet the Mueller investigation's task is not to release some big, giant report; its task is for them, as prosecutors, to go through and recommend indictments. If they choose to write a report, that is up to them. Now, this Congress could try to mandate that, but that is not their requirement. They are a special counsel. This is a group of attorneys that is making recommendations. That is all it is.  Don't judge an Attorney General nominee based on some accusation from some thought of what might happen and what he might do. Judge him on what he actually says and what he has done. Hold him to that standard.  I have also had some folks back in my State say they have heard that William Barr supports the possibility of some States having red flag laws on the Second Amendment. Now, I spoke to William Barr. He came to my office. We spent about 45 minutes together. We went through a whole litany of questions and answers about his background and the issues he has dealt with, his passions, his dealings with local law enforcement, his cooperation with State prisons, consent decrees, religious liberty. We talked of drug trials and processing. We talked about the whole issue of gang violence--on and on and on--including the Second Amendment.  He again reiterated he is supportive of the Second Amendment in every area. If someone loses his Second Amendment rights, it will only be based on due process, which is with a court's being involved. That has always been the standard for us as a country.  I have seen some of the things that have been written about him, one being that he is not supportive of the Second Amendment. That is absolutely false, and I can say those things based on my personal conversation with him after having asked him those questions. See not the things that have been written about him but the things that he has actually written and said about the Second Amendment. He is a protector of our rights under the Constitution. It is one of the things to which he has sworn under oath to protect as the previous Attorney General and would have to swear to again under oath.  This is a simple thing for us. We are looking at a qualified nominee who has an excellent background, the experience, and a passion to protect our country; who has shown a passion for law enforcement, protecting our Nation, and reducing violent crime in our country. I look forward to his stepping in and taking the lead in the Department of Justice.  May I make a side note on this? Again, this nomination reminds me of why it is so important that this Senate fix its nomination process. We have a broken nomination process--period.  If you take the last six Presidents combined, when they were putting their staffs together in their first 2 years of office, it was 25 times that someone in the Senate asked for additional time to debate that person. It could be any one of 100. For the last six Presidents, it was a total of 25 times that one person asked for additional time to debate. In this body, it was 25 times that somebody said for the last six Presidents combined that we need a little more time to debate this person. They asked for additional what is called postcloture debate time. That is a full intervening day--24 hours--plus an additional 30 hours after that just to debate. That is fine. For highly controversial nominees, it is entirely appropriate.  Yet, in the first 2 years of President Trump's Presidency, that request has been made 128 times--25 times for the last 6 Presidents combined versus 128 times for this President. It is not because they have been all that controversial as nominees, although I am fully aware that President Trump has nominated some folks who have created heated debate on this floor, but it was certainly not 128 times. In fact, many of the times after we had had that postcloture intervening day, plus another 30 hours, those people passed either unanimously or with 90-plus votes. They were not controversial. It was an attempt to shut down this Senate and shut down this President to keep him from hiring his staff. That has never happened before. There has never been a time that the Senate has tried to prevent an elected President from hiring his own team--until now.  In May of 2017, I made a proposal to fix our postcloture vote debate time, seeing what would happen. I continued that conversation over and over again with many of my Democratic colleagues.  The last session, we brought in front of the Rules Committee a proposal that was made by Harry Reid and then was passed under Harry Reid's time and his leadership in the Senate--that is, to limit postcloture debate time to streamline that process.  I brought that exact same proposal back out and said: Republicans voted with Democrats to make sure this process would work in 2013 and 2014. Now will Democrats vote with Republicans on the exact same language? And we will do this together to fix this process.  The Democrats gave me the Heisman at that point and said: No. It was good of you to vote with us, but we are not going to vote with you.  That was all last session.  I brought up another proposal that went through the Rules Committee today. It is a simple proposal. Historically in this body, there hasn't been a lot of postcloture debate time on nominees, especially not on nominees like district court judges or Deputy Assistant Secretaries of some entity.  I met today with the person who will be the IRS counsel, the counsel of the IRS, which I dare guess no one in this room could name right now, and certainly most people in America couldn't, but they have been blocked for a year, so the IRS does not have a Chief Counsel. Not a controversial nominee--will probably pass unanimously or near unanimously. Just to prevent the IRS from having a counsel, they have been slowed down.  My proposal is simple. We can still have postcloture debate. If anyone in this body wanted to slow down any nominee, they could still do that. They could request a full additional day, 24 hours, and then in the next day, instead of adding an additional 30 hours, it would be just an additional 2 hours. So instead of getting a full day plus 30 hours, they would get a full day plus 2 hours. That is still a lot of time.  Quite frankly, only 25 times in the last six Presidents have there been any requests for any additional time. So that would still allow a long period of time, but it would expedite the process so at least we could go through this.  If we don't fix this now, this will become the habit of the Senate from here on out. When the next Democratic President is elected, I can assure you that we will have the same issue with nominees that President Trump is having because it only takes one Senator to say: No. I want a whole intervening day plus 30 hours for every one of your nominees.  By the way, the President puts 1,200 people through the process of nomination--1,200. So count the times that will happen in the days ahead.  I know this is part of the ``resist Trump'' movement and to shut down the operation of his Presidency, but it actually is going to shut down the operation of every President from here on out if we don't fix this rule.  I am asking my Democratic colleagues to look long, to not look right in front of us, to look at the future of where this is really headed and what is really happening to this Senate. The precedent that is being set right now on debate will be the standard in the days ahead. Let's fix it now so we can get this resolved long term for the sake of our country and do this right.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to express my deep opposition to the nomination of Mr. William Barr to be our Nation's next Attorney General.  His nomination comes at a very trying time for our country. As our own President frequently twists the truth and constantly pushes the limits of the law, the American people deserve to know that the Attorney General--the top law enforcement officer in the country--is committed, above all else, to seeking truth, defending their civil and constitutional rights, administering justice on their behalf, and safeguarding our country against threats to our democracy.  I wish Mr. Barr were the person who could right the ship and stand up for the American people no matter what. I wish he were the person who could help guide our country through this critical juncture when questions about illegal payments involving both the Trump campaign and the Trump inaugural committee and Russia's interference in our elections and its attempts to influence millions of our friends and families must be fully explained to the public.  We know this is an administration that finds it so difficult to follow the law that it is being investigated in multiple jurisdictions at the Federal level--all of which would be overseen by Mr. Barr.  Sadly, it has become abundantly clear that Mr. Barr is incapable of being the impartial Attorney General people in communities across our country need and deserve and someone who stands up to the President when he is wrong.  Based on what I have seen over the past 2 years and despite the critical time we are in, I don't expect many of my Republican colleagues to join me on the floor today in order to defeat this nomination. Although people across the country have been raising red flags on this nomination, my Republican colleagues have been busy building the glidepath for Mr. Barr's nomination. In fact, just last week, the majority leader, standing here on the Senate floor, left little doubt about whether the majority would try to get this nomination sewn up. The leader referred to Mr. Barr as a ``tried and true public servant'' and a ``proven professional'' who was applying for the same job he got in 1991 under President George H. W. Bush. The job description, the majority leader said, ``remains exactly the same as it was years ago.'' But that is the problem. Senate Republicans are still operating as though it is the early 1990s, as if the world around them has not changed, as if what we have experienced for the past 2 years is normal.  Well, on behalf of the American people, I urge us all to wake up. For the past 2 years, we have had a President whose only consistent agenda items are self-preservation and self-dealing, whether that means flouting the law or disregarding ethics, acting with impunity, violating norms and destroying relationships with our allies, firing those who challenge him and bullying those he can't, threatening jail time for political opponents, or changing Federal policy by tweet and based on his current mood.  On top of all that, President Trump faces a number of investigations, including serious questions about whether he has obstructed justice in order to make the special counsel's investigation into Russia's meddling in our elections go away. That is the same special counsel investigation that has already resulted in 34 indictments or guilty pleas to date. Despite what the President would like us to believe, that is far from a witch hunt.  When President Trump's first choice to be the next Attorney General is someone with highly questionable views on Executive power, we have to be on alert.  When that nominee, Mr. Barr, can't adequately explain why, out of the blue--out of the blue--he sent a memo to the White House in order to criticize the special counsel investigation, absolve the President of questions about obstruction of justice, and make a case for less accountability with this President, we ought to be on alert.  When Mr. Barr writes that President Trump has ``complete authority to start or stop a law enforcement proceeding,'' we ought to be on alert.  Mr. Barr's memo makes no sense unless it was an audition for this job, and that is absolutely not how any President should select an Attorney General.  When we know that, if confirmed, Mr. Barr would be in charge of the special counsel investigation and would decide what, if anything, the public gets to know about the findings on Russia's 2016 election meddling, we ought to be on alert.  Someone who has written such an obviously flawed analysis of the investigation should not be put in charge of overseeing the investigation. That is just common sense.  People across this country sent us here to Congress not to shield the President from the law but to help restore integrity and independence to the Federal Government and to provide a check on the Executive branch, as outlined in the Constitution. And the idea that any Member of this Senate would support an Attorney General nominee who has openly and unequivocally advocated for less accountability when it comes to President Trump--that is just wrong, and the American people will not stand for it.  So to any of my colleagues who plan to support this nomination, I have a message: Seize this opportunity while you can to make it very clear to Mr. Barr and the Trump administration that you believe the American people deserve to know for sure that the findings on Russia's 2016 election meddling will be made public in order to get them the answers they deserve and that any attempt to cover up or hinder or otherwise muddy the waters around the Mueller investigation would be a serious disservice to the people we represent and will only lead to the further erosion of trust in our institution and our ability to work on their behalf.  The President is not above the law--not in the White House, not in New York, not anywhere. So Mr. Barr may be the Attorney General this President wants--someone to shield him from serious questions about abuse of power, someone who believes the President should be able to do more or less whatever he or she wants--but Mr. Barr is certainly not, in my opinion, the Attorney General this country needs, which is someone who will stand up for the rights of everyone else.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I came here this afternoon to give my customary weekly climate speech urging that it is time to wake up here, and I was planning to speak about a legal brief that a number of scientists, led by Robert Brulle and Naomi Oreskes, filed in the Ninth Circuit detailing the long history of the oil industry knowing about climate change, doing its own research to confirm what it knows about climate change, telling the public something they knew was false, and yet taking what they knew to be true and using it in their own internal planning. But something even better than that came up, so I come here to react to the--well, for starters, the Wall Street Journal editorial calling for a vote on the Green New Deal.  Let's go back a bit as to what the Wall Street Journal editorial page has been up to for the last, say, 20 years on climate change.  The Wall Street Journal editorial page has been a mouthpiece for the fossil fuel industry's climate denial. The messages of the fossil fuel industry are echoed and amplified through the Wall Street Journal editorial page. All the way up until 2011, if I recall correctly, they were simply denying that this was a problem. They constantly behave like what I would call the one-eyed accountant--looking only at the costs of responding to climate change, never the costs of climate change.  On this subject, for those who may be interested, I would actually like to incorporate by reference two previous climate speeches I gave on this completely bogus effort that has been maintained by the Wall Street Journal editorial page. The first was my speech of April 19, 2016, and then I went back at them again on July 24, 2018. They have been making it up for a very long time, and sure enough, up comes this latest in which just yesterday, February 12, they said: Let's have a vote in Congress on the Green New Deal as soon as possible. Then they went on with a lot of their usual one-eyed accountant stuff, never looking at the costs of climate change, only looking at the costs of preventing those harms, and they concluded: ``Let's not hesitate. Take the Green New Deal resolution and put it to a vote forthwith.''  Along the way, they went into some of their usual canards about renewables, saying that ``solar costs remain about 20 percent higher than natural gas while offshore wind is two-thirds more expensive'' without subsidies--well, unless you look at the subsidy for fossil fuel, which of course they don't, and the subsidy for fossil fuel has been quantified by the International Monetary Fund at $700 billion per year--$700 billion per year in the United States--propping up the fossil fuel industry. By contrast, the little tiny tax adjustments that we get for solar and wind, which the fossil fuel industry is always pushing back against, are nothing. There is a monster of a subsidy in the energy space, and it is the fossil fuel subsidy, but will the dear old Wall Street Journal editorial page ever admit that? Not a chance.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.  That came out in the Wall Street Journal that morning. Then Leader McConnell went out here to the Ohio Clock for his midday press conference, and guess what he said:       I've noted with great interest the Green New Deal, and      we're going to be voting on that in the Senate. That'll give      everybody an opportunity to go on record and see how they      feel about the Green New Deal.  I am in the habit of pointing out here how the string-pulling takes place and how the fossil fuel industry directs certain things and the mouthpieces say certain things and then we behave certain ways, but this may be the land speed record for a response. The Wall Street Journal says it wants a congressional vote, and that very day the vote gets announced. It is almost funny, if the topic weren't so serious.  The whole idea that this is the Republican response to climate change is really classic. It is really classic. Since the Citizens United decision, which powered up the fossil fuel industry to have real bullying dominance in Congress--at least over the Republican Party--no Senator here today has been on any bill to meaningfully reduce carbon dioxide emissions. It is never a topic. Nobody wants to talk about it. It is like the unwelcome, embarrassing guest at the dinner party: Oh, my gosh. Climate change. No, we can't possibly talk about that.  Never mind that NASA--which, by the way, RIP, Opportunity. The Opportunity has been driving around on the surface of Mars for 15 years, sending back information to us about that planet. NASA scientists built that thing, sent it to Mars, landed it safely on Mars, and has been driving it around for 15 years. My God, what a project that was. What a brilliant thing. So when NASA scientists say, ``Oh, and by the way, climate change is serious. You ought to listen,'' and we don't, that behavior is hard to explain. When we are listening to the flacks of the fossil fuel industry and not the scientists of NASA--and, by the way, 13 or 14 Federal Agencies in the latest report that came out under the Trump administration--we are way past there being any serious factual or scientific dispute here. There are just political demands by the industry with the biggest conflict of interest ever that we can't bring this up.  For pretty much 10 years, since Citizens United, nobody has brought up a serious piece of legislation to limit carbon dioxide emissions on the Republican side. Not one. Zero. Now, the majority leader is going to break this streak and bring up the first carbon-related bill. It is actually not a real bill. It is a resolution, but he is going to bring it up with the intention of voting against it. I kid you not. The majority leader has announced the intention of bringing up a resolution with the intention of voting against it. Who does that and why? Who had that brainstorm and where?  We will never understand this until we understand better how the anonymous dark money stuff flows around Washington. We need to clean that up. We need to pass the DISCLOSE Act. We need to make sure people know who is behind spending, who is behind advertising. We have to do all of that, but in the meantime, you do get these amazing moments in which the Wall Street Journal says--the editorial page, by the way. I think their correspondents, their reporters, are totally legitimate, and they do terrific work. It is the editorial page that is the problem child here.  So the Wall Street Journal editorial page says we need to have a vote on the Green New Deal. It takes less than a day for the majority leader to say we are going to have a vote on the Green New Deal, and he is calling up the first piece of climate legislation they have ever called up in the majority here, and they are calling it up to vote against it.  Isn't it finally time to have a real conversation about this? Isn't it finally time for there to be a Republican proposal? It has been nearly 10 years since Citizens United. I get it. The fossil fuel industry has enormous sway, but there comes a time when you even have to tell the biggest influencers in Congress that your day is over. It is time for us to treat with the facts and to work in a bipartisan fashion and to do what the people sent us here to do, which is to legislate.  So where is the Republican proposal? Where is the Republican plan? There isn't one. Nothing. Nada. Zip. Nihil. Nitchevo. They are going to call this up. They are going to call this up for a vote. I can hardly wait for this discussion. Bring it on, please.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: With that, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I wish to speak this afternoon in recognition of our late President, Ronald Reagan. I want to speak also about his wife Nancy, and I want to highlight their honest and passionate work to educate Americans about the real effects of Alzheimer's.  Last Wednesday, February 6, would have been President Reagan's 108th birthday, and we paused then to reflect not only on the life and legacy of President Ronald Reagan, but we also remember the way he carried himself, the vision he set for our country, and the direction he steered our Nation.  Years after he left the White House, the President and Nancy Reagan continued their public service to our Nation with grace and class, and that was true even as President Reagan was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.  In November of 1994, President Reagan wrote a handwritten letter to Americans announcing this diagnosis that ultimately took his life.  I read lots of biographies, I read lots of history, and this past week I finished a book, ``Reagan: An American Journey,'' written by Bob Spitz. The story of his circumstance with Alzheimer's captured my attention.  The book quotes President Reagan telling his daughter, Patti: ``I have this condition . . . I keep forgetting things.''       The doctors finally put a name to it. On November 4, 1994,      a doctor from the Mayo Clinic informed Nancy Reagan that,      having had an adequate chance to observe the president, the      diagnosis was conclusive: he had Alzheimer's.  According to Fred Ryan, a staff member for the President and Mrs. Reagan, ``She was quite upset, emotional.'' She spoke at length later that evening: ``So we're going to tell him tomorrow,'' she said, ``and I'd like you to be there.''       The next morning, a Saturday, they gathered in the library,      a small, comfortable room at the front of the house where the      Reagans typically received guests. The president seemed      puzzled when the doctor and Ryan arrived. ``Honey, come over      here and sit down,'' Nancy said, directing him to a couch      opposite the two men. ``The doctor has something he wants to      talk about.''       The doctor didn't beat around the bush. ``We think you have      Alzheimer's,'' he told Reagan. ``Okay,'' he responded faintly. ``What should I expect?''       ``We don't know much about it,'' the doctor admitted.      ``It's a degenerative disorder.'' He ran down a few of the      effects that Alzheimer's patients experienced while Nancy      Reagan struggled to control her emotions. She tried her      utmost to be supportive, but was overcome hearing about the      devastations of the disease. . . . He acknowledged, quite      bluntly, ``There is no cure.''       ``Can I ask a few questions?'' Ryan interjected.       While he and Nancy discussed how to handle the president's      activities--his schedule, office hours, appointments, and      appearances--Reagan wandered over to a small round table in a      corner and sat down, staring hypnotically into the yard.      After a few minutes, he picked up a pen and began to write.      When he finished, he handed two sheets of paper filled with      his cramped handwriting to [his staffer]. ``Why don't we get      this typed up and put it out,'' Reagan suggested.  It was a letter dated that November 5, 1994. And with faith and courage, indeed, President and Nancy Reagan faced the disease together.  Together, they founded the Ronald and Nancy Reagan Research Institute at the Alzheimer's Association in Chicago, IL, focused on researching, understanding, and treating Alzheimer's disease.  Over the past several decades, this research institute has awarded millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research grants and has continued to see breakthroughs in our understanding of this aggressive and disastrous disease.  Congress has also rightfully come together in a nonpartisan manner to fight this disease head-on. For example, last December, just a few months ago, with legislation that was sponsored by our colleague from Maine, Senator Susan Collins, Congress passed and the President signed our BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act, which aims to combat Alzheimer's through a collaborative public health framework. The BOLD Act will create an Alzheimer's public health infrastructure at the direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which will establish Alzheimer's centers for excellence across the country, award funding to public health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis, and increase data collection, analysis, and reporting through cooperative agreements with public and nonprofit entities.  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, led by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Blunt. I have advocated and successfully worked with my colleague Senator Blunt and the members of the committee to provide $2.3 billion for Alzheimer's disease research in FY 2019, finally reaching the $2 billion funding goal for research laid out by the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's.  I am the cochair of the Senate NIH Caucus, and I am optimistic that these funding increases, combined with NIH initiatives to map the human brain and further develop personalized medicine, will, I hope, lead us closer to an Alzheimer's treatment and a cure.  Eleven years after President Reagan's death, Nancy Reagan continued her Alzheimer's advocacy work, helping to dramatically increase the attention and resources paid to the research of this disease. She recognized that degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's not only pose a financial burden to our Nation and health system but, more importantly and more significantly, these diseases threaten families with significant financial difficulty and tremendous emotional hardship.  As President Reagan's primary caregiver during his battle with Alzheimer's, Nancy reminded us of the importance of caretakers and families and the struggles they themselves go through while watching loved ones suffer.  As we continue our work to treat, cure, and prevent Alzheimer's and other degenerative diseases, we will also continue looking for ways to ease the financial and mental turmoil on caretakers, for they suffer so much as well.  When President Reagan announced his Alzheimer's disease, he did so much more than just admitting to having the disease. He fought it, and he destigmatized it not only for himself but for those who came after him and for those still to come who may be faced with this same circumstance.  In the closing letter that President Reagan wrote--and, incidentally, when he handed it to the staffer and said, ``Type it up and send it out,'' they read it and said, ``Let's just send it in your handwriting, Mr. President.'' So that is what happened, and in that closing letter, President said this:       Let me thank you, the American people, for giving me the      great honor of allowing me to serve as your President. When      the Lord calls me home, whenever that may be, I will leave      with the greatest love for this country of ours and eternal      optimism for its future. I now begin the journey that will      lead me into the sunset of my life. I know that for America      there will always be a bright dawn ahead.  I, too, believe that America's best days are ahead of us, and I implore Washington to reflect upon President Reagan's enduring optimism.  Civil in disagreement and often willing to cross party lines to work toward solutions, I hope we can all remember, like President Reagan, to focus on the real issues facing our Nation, and I hope that all Members of the Congress, from all walks of life, will be bold in leveraging their life experiences to achieve greatness for our Nation, just as President Reagan and Nancy Reagan did, deepening America's resolve to fight this terrible disease.  I honor President Reagan and his wife Nancy. I thank them for their service to our country, and I thank them for their attention to this disease, Alzheimer's. May we also have the courage and will to continue the battle to rid our country, its citizens, and the world of this affliction.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as many of my colleagues here on the Senate floor know, tomorrow is Valentine's Day, and yesterday, my colleague and my good friend, for whom I have so much respect, Senator Ernst from Iowa, was asking Members of this body to come down to the floor and talk about love. Some of you may have seen that.  Now, I have to admit that I am very close to Senator Ernst. I think she is one of the best Senators in the whole body. But I was a little bit leery. To be honest, talking about love on the Senate floor is really not my thing. I am not sure I have done that in 4 years here. As a matter of fact, I know I haven't done that in 4 years.  Then, I thought, well, you know, it is Valentine's Day. I thought, of course, immediately about my family and my beautiful wife Julie, the love of my life. I thought I could talk about that. I thought I could talk about my three daughters, all young Alaskan women, strong. They make me proud each and every day.  That was easy, thinking about Valentine's Day and love that way--Julie, Meghan, Isabella, and Laurel, who, by the way, celebrated her 18th birthday yesterday. They are the loves of my life.  But then my staff told me: Wait a minute. This isn't that kind of speech. What Senator Ernst wanted us to do was to speak about the love of your State and how we all love our State.  Now, that is easy for everybody here because we all do love our State. Then, I realized, well, you know what, Senator Ernst wanted that. It is Valentine's Day, and, of course, it is toward the end of the week, and I typically do my ``Alaskan of the Week'' speech every Thursday or Wednesday.  This is a little bit of a jazzed up Valentine's Day version of Alaskan of the Week, with the Ernst hashtag ``homestatelove,'' which is what she put out, and I think some other Senators did.  I thought this would be a combination this evening of a little bit of a love story to Alaska, my constituents, combined with the Alaskan of the Week, and, of course, to support what Senator Ernst wanted a bunch of us to do.  I certainly love coming down to the floor every week to talk about the Alaskans of the Week. It is one of my favorite things to do. So, today, I just want to say a little bit about some of those Alaskans of the Week, not really one or two but just kind of a combo--literally, dozens and dozens of Alaskans, since I started here in the Senate 4 years ago, where I have had the opportunity to come down and talk about them.  They are as old as 100 and as young as 8. Last week we had an 8-year-old. Boy, was he really a fine young man from Juneau. They come from the Far North, the Arctic, and the misty temperate southeast of Alaska. They live surrounded by tundra, by the churning seas, by mountains, by rainforests. These are all those who have earned the title Alaskan of the Week. They come from what we call urban Alaska and from some of the 200 small communities and villages that dot my State, which are not connected by roads. It is a big challenge we have in Alaska.  They are librarians, artists, former Governors, reporters, healthcare workers, whalers, counselors, pastors, lawyers, athletes, students, teachers, and nearly every profession imaginable. Some of them have retired. Some of them are just starting school and aren't even of working age.  They are a diverse group of people, as you can imagine, but they all have one thing in common. They love Alaska. They love their country. They have the fire, the drive, and the heart to use whatever skills they have, whatever experiences they have to help others.  Isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about, what the hashtag ``homestatelove'' is all about, and, certainly, what the Alaskan of the Week is all about?  Now, when I talk about the Alaskan of the Week, sometimes these people have seen and gotten and deserve a lot of attention in Alaska and even nationally. Other times, they are less well known but no less impactful. Let me give you a couple of examples: someone who has been picking up trash on the side of the road for years, just doing it every day; helping people to find a pet to love; making meals for the sick; starting and contributing to nonprofits; writing beautiful prose; helping people overcome addictions; establishing iconic businesses; working their whole lives to do what they think is right for their community, for their State, and the communities they love.  Of course, they are all inspiring to us, and what I try to do once a week is to come down and not just inspire the pages, who, I know, look forward to this speech, but anyone in America who is listening. By the way, you have to come up to Alaska and you, too, will love, and I mean ``love'' Alaska when you come up to visit.  Now, they are inspiring to all of us in Alaska, but, as I mentioned, all around the country last year. For example, I got to talk about the Alaska Pacific University's ski team--world renowned, gold medalists, Olympic medalists--inspiring young people all across the globe to race faster and race better.  Last year, I had the opportunity to talk about a young teenager from Gambell, Chris Apassingok. He made national headlines for his insistence, despite tremendous backlash from some extreme groups outside of Alaska, to continue his cultural heritage of hunting whales to feed his community through subsistence.  Here is another example that will go straight to the heart of my colleague, Senator Ernst from Iowa. In December, Carol Seppilu from Nome, who has overcome tremendous difficulties and disabilities and pain in her life, ran 85 miles of a 100-mile race in Council Bluffs, IA, and she is training for another race.  That kind of training isn't easy in Nome, where she has to walk through blizzards just to get on a treadmill. Carol has the racing community--the long racing community, 100-mile races--in Alaska and Iowa and, literally, around the country in awe of her, if you know her story, and rooting for her.  Sometimes we have a lot of negative news here in DC. I always say there is a lot more going on bipartisan that our friends in the media, who sit above the Presiding Officer's desk there, don't often report, but it can be negative. I think sometimes it can be easy to forget that we live in the greatest country in the world--no doubt about it--the greatest country in the history of the world, in my view, filled with good people who wake up every morning determined to do what is right, to give back to their communities, whether in Alaska or North Dakota, like the Presiding Officer.  I want to thank Senator Ernst for bringing us down to the floor yesterday and even today to talk a little bit about love--good initiative there for Valentine's Day. I thank all of the people of my State. This is a love story, not just of my wife and daughters but of all these great Alaskans of the Week who have been doing such a great job for Alaska and their country. So, to all of them, Happy Valentine's Day.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to Alfred K. Newman, one of last remaining Navajo code talkers, who passed away on January 13 of this year.  Mr. Newman was born in Coolidge, NM, on July 21, 1924. He was Naaneesht'ezhi Dine'e--Zuni Clan--and born for Tsi'naajinii--Black Streak Wood People Clan. One of six children, his mother wove rugs that were sold at the Coolidge Trading Post and his stepfather worked as a silversmith there.  When Mr. Newman was about 8 years old, his family sent him to the Rehoboth Mission School, where he boarded during the 9 month school year and rarely saw his parents. During the summers, he herded sheep. At one point, they had a herd of 200, and the young shepherd loved watching the lizards, birds, and bugs that surrounded him as he herded.  Mr. Newman grew up knowing both Navajo and English. However, the boarding students were not allowed to speak Navajo at the school. One time, when he spoke in Navajo, in order to help another Navajo student who knew no English, he was punished by having to write ``I must not speak Navajo'' 500 times.  While the missionaries at the Rehoboth Mission School forbade Mr. Newman and other Navajo students from speaking their language, as did Federal Government Indian boarding schools, the U.S. military came to greatly appreciate the strategic advantage the unwritten Dine language held.  Mr. Newman enlisted in the Marines, in 1943, when he was 18, inspired to defend the Nation in light of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He, along with an estimated 44,000 other Native Americans, served in World War II, even though they couldn't vote in U.S. elections and faced discrimination within the military.  Soon after Mr. Newman enlisted, he was assigned to a secret mission, as part of the Navajo code talkers. He attended code school, learning the complex code by memory, and learned how to operate communications equipment. Serving in the 1st Battalion, 21st Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, Alfred was stationed in New Caledonia, Guadalcanal, Bougainville Island, Guam, and Iwo Jima, among other duty stations. He saw battle at the latter three locations and was stationed in Iwo Jima during 28 days of the famous battle and was there the day the Americans raised the flag over Mount Suribachi. Mr. Newman was honorably discharged with the rank of corporal in December 1945.  After his discharge, he came back to New Mexico, and married his sweetheart, Betsy Eleanore Denetsone. He worked as an ammunition inspector at Fort Wingate and then at an open-pit mine overseeing blasting at Kirkland Field. Together, he and Betsy have 5 children, 13 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren and were married 69 years before his passing.  The Japanese famously never broke the Navajos' code, and Navajo code talkers are credited with playing a decisive role in key World War II battles, including Iwo Jima. The Navajo code talker mission was kept secret until 1968, when it was declassified. In 2000, Congress awarded the Congressional Silver Medal to the Navajo code talkers. Like so many others, Mr. Newman was humble about his bravery in service and modest about his medals. During a 2010 interview for an oral history project, Mr. Newman was asked, ``How did [the war] change you?'' He replied that, ``Before the war, I was just going just like any other non-Navajo. Peaceful, no worries. Doing what I like. But when the war came, it was a different story. So I had to do what needed to be done.''  We are forever grateful to Mr. Newman and all his fellow courageous code talkers for doing ``what needed to be done'' to defend our country. We will always honor and will never forget their service and sacrifice to the Nation."

On December 10, 1869, the Wyoming Territory passed the first law in U.S. history granting women the right to vote and hold public office. This right became so important to the people of Wyoming that, when the State sought statehood, it refused to enter the Union if this right was not protected.  In 2015, I came to the floor to speak in honor of the 125th anniversary of Wyoming statehood. I shared with the Senate the challenge Wyoming faced from Congress in its quest to become a member of the Union. I believe it is timely to share that story again.  The debate in Congress was contentious, with the arguments centering on one of our most proud accomplishments: a decision made long before Wyoming became a State. On December 10, 1869, the Wyoming Territory was the first in the United States to grant women the right to vote.  Efforts to attain statehood finally came to fruition 20 years later. It was incumbent on our delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Joseph M. Carey, to convince his colleagues to support the statehood bill.  On March 26, 1890, the day of the statehood bill debate, Joseph Carey spoke passionately about Wyoming. His words still hold true today. He said that Wyoming was rich in agricultural possibilities. He explained Wyoming was one of nature's great storehouses of minerals. Joseph Carey also talked about grazing development, educational leadership, widespread railway construction, the model Constitution, and the unique opportunities for women.  Yet opponents to our statehood did not support women having the right to vote. On the same day as Joseph Carey's impassioned speech, Representative William Oates of Alabama argued against our admittance to the Union. He said, ``Mr. Speaker, I do not hesitate to say that in my judgment the franchise has been too liberally extended. Should we ever reach universal suffrage this Government will become practically a pure democracy and then the days of its existence are numbered.''  The U.S. House of Representatives narrowly passed Wyoming's statehood bill with a vote of 139 to 127. The U.S. Senate passed the bill on June 27, 1890. Wyoming officially became the 44th State on July 10, 1890, and became the first state to allow women the right to vote and hold public office.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 1 of the Sixty-Fifth Legislature of the State of Wyoming recognizing December 10, 2019, as Wyoming Women's Suffrage Day.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:"

I am honored to pay tribute to this important first flight and to honor their sacrifices.  The all-volunteer organization, Old Glory Honor Flight, was founded in 2009 by individuals who had a dream of creating an honor flight experience for military veterans in northeast Wisconsin. A dedicated board of volunteers launched the first official flight on October 27, 2009, when they hosted 95 World War II veterans on a trip to our Nation's Capital to experience firsthand the national memorials honoring American military servicemembers.  The honor flight's mission is to create a safe and memorable experience for veterans who call Wisconsin home. Until now, each honor flight has taken place within a single day, sending veterans to Washington, DC, to thank them for all they sacrificed to keep our Nation safe and free. Since its inception, Old Glory Honor Flight has flown more than 3,500 veterans on more than 40 missions.  Through the generous support of individuals and businesses, Old Glory Honor Flight has grown tremendously in the past decade. This month, for the first time in its 10-year existence, the organization is sending 53 veterans who served in Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand back to Vietnam for 2 weeks.  Wisconsinites owe a debt of gratitude to these servicemembers who answered our country's call to serve and defend the United States. These veterans served with honor and endured the horrors of war. When they returned home, they were shunned and denied their rightful hero's welcome. We must vow to never let this happen again and to always honor those who serve in our Armed Forces. Let this flight be a reminder that we can all do our part to keep the sacred trust we have with our veterans. Let it be a reminder that there is still more work to do to honor their service, and let us be inspired by their selfless and heroic service to a grateful nation.  I am honored to recognize the very first Wisconsin Honor Flight to Vietnam and I commend Old Glory Honor Flight on this extraordinary mission to honor our Wisconsin military veterans. It is my sincere hope that this momentous trip will bring some peace to these brave men traveling back to Vietnam."

As his last official act in the Governor's Ceremonial Office in the Idaho State Capitol, outgoing Idaho Governor C.L. Butch Otter co-presented, with current Idaho Governor Brad Little, the 2019 Idaho Medal of Achievement to Governor Phil Batt for his many accomplishments and years of service to the State of Idaho. The award is considered the highest civilian honor bestowed by the State. Phil Batt is the third recipient of this great honor, for which many nominations from across our State have been made by the public.  Governor Batt has an extensive career of service to our State and Nation. He served as our State's 29th Governor from 1995 to 1999. Prior to his service as Governor, he served as Idaho Republican Party Chairman, Lieutenant Governor of Idaho, and president pro tempore of the Idaho Senate. He served in the Idaho Senate for approximately 15 years after serving in the Idaho House of Representatives from 1965 to 1967. He also served in the U.S. Army from 1945 to 1946 after growing up on a farm in Wilder, ID.  Idaho has benefited greatly from Governor Phil Batt's sensible voice, commitment to service, and outstanding leadership. Governor Batt's principal role in advancing human rights in Idaho is among his many achievements on behalf of Idahoans. He led efforts to establish a Commission on Human Rights and pushed for benefits for Idaho farmworkers.  Governor Batt, you have much to be proud of and reflect on for your outstanding service over your exemplary life. You have stood against inequities and, in so doing, helped make others' paths better. Your mentorship, encouragement, and guidance have been instrumental in helping current and future leaders in our great State get a start.

Bill spent his entire life in service to Oklahoma and the Nation, and his loss will be felt throughout the State.  Bill was a talented attorney, businessman, and civic leader. Among many different titles Bill held throughout his career, he served the State he loved on the Oklahoma Board of Regents for Higher Education and the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents.  Bill was widely recognized and respected as one of Oklahoma's outstanding leaders, and he was inducted into both the Oklahoma Hall of Fame and the Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame.  As a businessman who developed the largest software engineering company in Oklahoma and the owner and publisher of the Lawton Constitution, Bill was admired for his entrepreneurial ability and success. A tireless advocate for Oklahoma business, he served stints as chairman of both the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and the Oklahoma Business Roundtable.  I worked closely with Bill in his role as civilian aide to the Secretary to the Army and am so thankful to have a man of such integrity, character, and grit in this position.  If you spent any time at all around Bill, you were sure to know that he was the son of a sergeant major, the ``backbone of the Army.'' Friends say that growing up in the house of a non-commissioned officer gave him a love not only for the Army but also for the enlisted men and women who serve their country.  Bill was incredibly proud of his dad's service to our Nation and continued that tradition of service. No one loved, admired, and supported our men and women in uniform more than Bill.  Kay and I are praying for Bill's family, friends, and many loved ones in this extremely hard time. Bill was an exceptional leader, a loving father, and an incomparable friend.

As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that embodies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my distinct privilege to honor JL Marine Systems, Inc., as the Senate Small Business of the Week.  Located in Tampa, FL, JL Marine Systems is known in fishing communities throughout the country as the manufacturer of the Power-Pole shallow water anchor. John Oliverio, the creator of the Power-Pole, has been an angler for all his life and used this experience to create a more practical approach to shallow water fishing. As a flats fisherman, he was frustrated that bringing his boat to a stop with a push pole or an anchor required him to lose sight of fish. In 1998, John devised the concept for an anchor that he could lower from anywhere, allowing him to keep his eyes on fish. Today, the Power-Pole is a premier shallow water anchor, featuring sophisticated technology for more effective shallow water fishing.  JL Marine Systems' Power-Pole technology is available in five different models, at more than 3,500 dealers, manufacturers, and retailers. These quality products have helped JL Marine Systems to build strong partnerships in the boating and fishing industries and has earned accolades at professional fishing tournaments, in magazines, and on television shows. The Power-Pole won Best New Boating Accessory at the International Convention of Allied Sportsfishing Trades in 2011, 2012, and 2013 and won awards for its electronics at the International Boatbuilders Exhibition and Conference in 2017.  JL Marine Systems' commitment to a higher standard is not only seen in their innovative products and customer service, but also in how the company gives back to its community. JL Marine Systems is a proud supporter of the Florida Aquarium, the Coastal Conservation Association, the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation, and numerous other organizations. The company also supports its community by hosting hurricane relief fundraisers and by sponsoring Tampa-area youth sports teams and high school and college fishing teams.  John Oliverio's work to develop and produce the Power-Pole shallow water anchor represents the innovation that Floridian entrepreneurs are known so well for. Through hard work and perseverance, John and his team at JL Marine Systems have revolutionized the shallow water anchor and have set an excellent example of ingenuity. I would like to congratulate John and the entire team at JL Marine Systems for being named the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success."

We, as a country, cannot tolerate this behavior, and certainly this Chamber has no room for bigotry. Furthermore, I must warn the general public that despite the warranted outcry we saw in response to the Representative from Minnesota's irresponsible comments, this is the new normal for the liberal base in America.  To be clear, anti-Semitism has become an all-too-common occurrence in politics among the Democrat base and the far left who see Israel as nothing more than an extension of phantom corruption and colonialism.  Politicians who appeal to this type of ignorance are simply shoring up a new Democratic constituency. That is the ethos that primed the Minnesota Representative's ludicrous and insulting accusation of ``bought-and-paid-for'' politicians who stand with Israel.  It is that type of loose, cheap, anti-Semitic rhetoric that led to the rise of the Third Reich. It is clear to all of us, there are a couple of our new colleagues across the aisle that need to be reminded. In fact, they need to admit that the brutal regime of Iran continues to be the chief obstacle to peace and security in the Middle East, and thus, the root of most all terrorism that threatens our homeland.  For decades, Iran's funding of terrorism and extremist groups in the region has fueled violence, civil war, and bloodshed. The Iranian Parliament literally burned the U.S. flag on their parliament floor and chants, ``death to Israel,'' and ``death to America'' in their streets.  At home, all Americans must oppose the radical and xenophobic boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement which are promulgated by the left. This BDS campaign is peddled by intellectually dishonest anti-Semites whose sole purpose is to attack Israel, attempting to delegitimize and isolate it from the rest of the world.  Any Member of this congressional body with ties to the BDS movement should renounce them immediately. We must hold our elected officials accountable. Whether on Twitter or in the Halls of Congress, disgusting insinuations and bigotry must be condemned in all forms. Those who continue the use of anti-Semitic rhetoric should be held accountable for their actions.  The Democrats should follow the high standards and the high bar that the Republican leader has taken when it comes to committee assignments to those who make bigoted remarks.  America must continue to stand together in support of Israel and in support of peace in the Middle East and the world.

I rise because it is Black History Month, and I am always, during Black History Month, amazed at what Dr. King called to our attention in his letter from the Birmingham jail. It is one of the great masterpieces of written word in the history of our country. I encourage all people to read his letter from the Birmingham jail.  But I think that as important as it is, it is equally as important to read the letter that Dr. King was responding to, because if you don't read the letter he is responding to in his letter, then you cannot totally appreciate the letter from the Birmingham jail.  I am not going to read the letter in its entirety. I will just tell you a little bit about it. This letter--I hold a copy of it in my hand--was signed by eight of the leading citizens in the area, members of the clergy, all. These leading citizens were admonishing persons to proceed with caution. Dr. King reminds us, however, that the time is always right to do what is right.  They said in their letter, ``But we are convinced that these demonstrations are unwise and untimely.'' The time is always right to do what is right.  And I would also add--this is not in Dr. King's retort, but that we should not allow political expediency to trump the moral imperative to do what is right. The time is always right to do what is right.  People are saying today: We should wait. We don't have to move now. Let's wait. Let's let something else happen before we take any position.  They go on to say in their letter, ``We agree rather with certain local Negro leadership, which has called for honest and open negotiation of racial issues in our area.'' To the many who say, let's have a dialogue, let's have a discussion about the race question; we need to talk about the race question.  I say to my dear brothers and sisters, dear friends, and dear Members, this was written April 12, 1963. We have been talking about the race question long before this and since this. The time is always right to do that which is right.  Dr. King reminded us that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. He said that in his letter. That means that if we allow injustice to exist in the White House as it relates to bigotry, and xenophobia, and homophobia, and Islamophobia, if we allow it to exist in the White House, I say to my dear brothers and sisters, it is a threat to every house in this country. Injustice anywhere is still a threat to justice everywhere.  So I happen to be one who is willing to accept all of the criticisms, and all of the slings and arrows. Send them my way. I will do what is right.  The Constitution allows it, in fact, my constituents demand it. It is time for us to take the issue up again. It is going to happen, I say to my dear brothers and sisters. I believe that we cannot allow bigotry and policy emanating from the Presidency to go unchecked.  So I can only say to you, impeachment is the solution, and the place for that solution to be properly addressed is the United States House of Representatives. Right here in this well. Impeachment is not dead."

As co-chair of the bipartisan Career and Technical Education Caucus, and a senior member of the Education and Labor Committee, I have long been aware of the importance of CTE programs that provides learners of all ages with career-ready skills.  From agriculture to the arts, from marketing to manufacturing, CTE programs work to develop America's most valuable resource: its people.  Together with my friend and colleague, Congressman   Jim Langevin, co-chairman of the Career and Technical Education Caucus, we introduced a resolution officially designating February as CTE month. I encourage all of my colleagues to sign on as cosponsors because CTE truly benefits all Americans.  CTE is taught in a range of settings: from high school and area technical centers, to technical and 2-year community colleges. Millions of high school and college students are enrolled in CTE programs across the Nation, bringing CTE to every community in the country.  Fortunately, in July 2018, President Trump signed into law the Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act. I authored this bill with Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi and it aims to close the skills gap by modernizing Federal investment in CTE programs, and connecting educators with industry stakeholders.  It marks the first major overhaul to the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act since 2006. The Perkins Act is important for educational institutions as well as local businesses. Small business owners rely upon Perkins programs to increase the number of skilled candidates in emerging sectors. Future workers in fields such as manufacturing, information technology, healthcare, and agriculture also rely on career and technical education programs to obtain the skills necessary for high-skill, high-wage, family-sustaining jobs and careers.  Essentially, Mr. Speaker, we are providing the education and tools to equip a 21st century workforce for this Nation. For students who pursue a career in technical education, it isn't some kind of plan B option. CTE has established itself as a path that many high-achieving students choose in pursuit of industry certification and hands-on skills that they can use right away out of high school in skills-based education programs or in college.  By modernizing the Federal investment in CTE programs, we can connect more educators with industry stakeholders and close the skills gap in this country. There are good jobs out there, but people need to be qualified to get them. A career in technical education is a pathway forward for each and every one of these people.  CTE gives people from all walks of life an opportunity to succeed. During CTE month, we celebrate the achievements of students and spread awareness that there is no one-size-fits-all plan for success in life. I thank Congressman Langevin for his dedication to this issue, and urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution."

I thank Representative Khanna for leading on this issue.  This brutal war has caused mass starvation and cut off humanitarian aid from reaching those most in need. The number of casualties has exceeded half a million men, women, and children. We don't know if this legislation will reach the President's desk or whether he will sign it, but with reporting that Saudi coalition members have transferred U.S. weapons to terrorist groups in Yemen, and the Trump administration choosing to ignore a deadline last week to report on whether Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is responsible for the death of journalist Khashoggi, we must keep up the pressure to end U.S. involvement in hostilities in Yemen.  At the end of the day, U.S. participation in this war is illegal, having never been authorized by Congress. When the United States became involved with the Saudi-led war, this action was not covered by the Authorization for Use of Military Force issued by Congress in the wake of 9/11. The Houthis, against whom the Saudi coalition is engaged, are not affiliated with al-Qaida. But because of the 60-word 2001 AUMF, three Presidents have warped that limited authorization into enabling a global-spanning war, broad enough to cover airstrikes in the Khyber Pass and to boots on the ground in Niger. This AUMF contains no time limits, no geographic constraints, and no need for congressional consent or oversight.  In the last 17 years, the 2001 AUMF has been cited as statutory authority for unclassified military actions in more than 18 countries, and Congress has been left in the dark about many of these operations. Our men and women in uniform have deployed time and again, shouldering a heavy burden while at the same time the public is becoming more removed from the conflicts in which we are engaged.  Today, less than 20 percent of the Members of the 116th Congress were present when this vote was taken in 2001. But after more than a decade of putting more and more war-making power in the hands of the President and greater burden on the shoulders of our troops, Congress must take a stand. We cannot continue to be sidelined from the decisions critical to our national security.  The Constitution is clear. Congress, not the President, has the power to declare war. The President can respond to an imminent threat to the homeland or to U.S. personnel abroad, or if we are attacked, but this is the only situation in which he may dispense with congressional approval, because as current law dictates, once the President initiates hostilities against a new enemy, Congress, not the President, dictates whether hostilities can continue.  It would be wrong for Congress to allow any President solely on his or her own authority and aside from an imminent, clear threat to sustain our involvement in any conflict, especially one so fraught as the conflict in Yemen. The United States cannot enter any conflict in the Middle East, East Asia, or Africa with no clear strategy, no clear objectives, and no authorization from Congress.  The American people need answers, and our troops and their families deserve a public debate over the sacrifices we ask them to make. I understand that for many Members, after close to two decades of war in Iraq and Afghanistan, the idea of debating, let alone authorizing, new military action is not going to be popular, even if warranted. But we were not elected to pass the buck or abdicate our constitutional responsibility. We must debate these issues.  Mr. Speaker, as a combat veteran and a Member of Congress, I know it is one of our most important and solemn responsibilities to decide when and how we send Americans into harm's way. We cannot shirk that responsibility because of its gravity. We must embrace the tough decisions our role requires us to carry out.  I hope today is the beginning of our long-overdue debate over the AUMF and the true costs of war on our country and the men and women who fight and die serving it."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National Cancer Prevention Month and to highlight the long-term, exceptional work of the Winthrop P. Rockefeller Cancer Institute at the University of Arkansas in Little Rock.  The Rockefeller Cancer Institute opened in 1989 and serves as Arkansas' only comprehensive cancer treatment and research facility. Now in its 30th year, the Rockefeller Cancer Institute is in the process of pursuing designation as a National Cancer Institute.  In 2018, approximately 44 Arkansans a day were diagnosed with some form of cancer, and 6,910 Arkansans lost their lives to this terrible disease. NCI grant funding would increase Arkansans' access to clinical trials and new therapies, expand services for patients, and create more healthcare jobs in central Arkansas.  With 70 NCI-designated cancer centers across the country, not one is in Arkansas, and therefore, this is a vitally important mission.  I applaud the Rockefeller Institute's objective. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Bill Holmes, who passed away peacefully late last year. He left an indelible impact on the Arkansas business community.  Bill dedicated over four decades of his life to financial services, community banking, and government policy, most recently as CEO of the Arkansas Bankers Association. I was fortunate to work with him throughout my business career in Arkansas.  Among his friends, Bill was known for his quick wit, mischievous smile, and ability to connect with others. Bill's contributions to our State and our community banks will not be forgotten. I join all Arkansans in recognizing Bill for his remarkable career and his life well-lived.  I extend my respect, affection, and prayers to his wife, Rita, and their family and friends. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my friend, Sybil Jordan Hampton, who was recently awarded the alumni award from the University of Chicago for providing leadership in advancing social justice and equity in our society.  Sybil grew up in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in 1962, in the aftermath of the Little Rock Nine integration of Central High in 1957, Sybil became the first African American student to complete her entire education at Little Rock Central High School.  She went on to earn her bachelor's degree from Earlham College, a master's degree in elementary education from the University of Chicago, and a second master's degree and doctorate from Columbia University.  After working as a higher education administrator and philanthropist, Sybil returned to Little Rock to become president of the Winthrop Rockefeller Foundation, focusing on building a better Arkansas. She continues to be involved in many local community service organizations and is a life member of the Girl Scouts of America.  As a local educator and civic and community leader, Arkansas has been an enriched place to live and work due to the outstanding accomplishments of Sybil Jordan Hampton. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of Mr. Jim Hinkle, who was inducted into the Arkansas Outdoor Hall of Fame last year by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.  Born and raised in Mountain View, Arkansas, Jim graduated from the University of Central Arkansas before pursuing a lifelong career in community service and the outdoors. He served as commissioner of the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission before transitioning to 14 years on the board of the National Wild Turkey Federation, ultimately serving as president of the national chapter.  Jim's leadership helped lead toward the expansion and improvement of habitat throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada. His service to the State of Arkansas and to wildlife and conservation causes will not be forgotten, and I join all Arkansans in congratulating Jim on this achievement and wish him much continued success. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life of Thurman Booth. Thurman retired earlier this year after serving more than 52 years in wildlife services, most recently as the Arkansas director of Wildlife Services for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  Thurman's journey began at Louisiana State University. He quickly joined the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife as a trainee and then became assistant State supervisor in the Division of Wildlife Services. He served as the Wildlife Services lead in Arkansas since 1968.  We appreciate his service to conservation and to the Game and Fish Commission, and I wish him a great retirement."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I don't know what it is like to lose a child to gun violence. My words are not sufficient to describe that pain.  These are the words of Patricia Oliver, the mother of Joaquin Oliver. Joaquin was killed 1 year ago tomorrow at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Dear Representative Deutch: I am writing to you to plead      with you to ensure that other mothers and fathers do not have      to endure this gut-wrenching pain, the senseless and      unnecessary loss of life, liberty, and the pursuit of      happiness for my family.       My name is Patricia Oliver. My beautiful son, Joaquin, was      one of the 17 who lost their lives at Marjory Stoneman      Douglas High School last year. Words cannot express the      devastation wrought on the families of the victims, the      shattering of families, friends, and those who survived.       After the avoidable mass shooting, many said we were in      their thoughts and prayers. How many of you in this Chamber      uttered just those words?       I thank you for your prayers, but are you actually thinking      about your constituents, about those you have sworn an oath      to serve, and about those you know and love? If you were      thinking, you would do something.       It is in your power to enact commonsense gun laws,      commonsense mental health support, and appropriate support      and guidance to law enforcement. If we have the courage to stand up and do      this, then never again will thoughts and prayers be needed in      the aftermath of a mass shooting.       This country is at a crossroads. We need your leadership.      We need your love, your compassion. We need your serious      thought unmarred by lobbyists.       I implore you to think about the kids. Think about how you      would feel if it were your son, your daughter, your      granddaughter, or your grandson, because it could be.       Had we--had the Members of this body--learned the lessons      of Columbine and of Sandy Hook, Joaquin would still be here.      The lives of hundreds would not have been ripped to pieces.      This was preventable.       Something you can do, and urge your colleagues to do right      this moment, is support the recently introduced universal      background checks bill.       It is now my mission in life to do whatever I can to ensure      that no mother and no father have to endure the pain I have,      that no shining beacon of light, hope, and love like my      Joaquin is snuffed out too soon in a preventable mass      shooting.       We know that he didn't have to die if our leaders had done      enough. Other countries have solved this problem. The roadmap      exists. Please follow it.       Sincerely, Patricia Oliver, Parkland, Florida.  Mr. Speaker, Patricia and Manuel, Joaquin's father, have not allowed Joaquin to remain a victim. He is an advocate.  Last month, the Olivers visited Capitol Hill with a statue of Joaquin to deliver this letter and to call for change. It is time to listen to them, Patricia, Manuel, and Joaquin. We shouldn't have to know the pain that Patricia and Manny know, that 16 other families in Parkland know, and that families in every corner of this country know, to do something about gun violence.  The time to act is now."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind you and my colleagues that Congress appropriated billions for disaster relief for Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In the latest effort, however, to find funding to build a wall, the White House and top budget officials continue to discuss shifting disaster funding to pay for a wall that a foreign nation was to pay for and now must be borne by people still recovering from disaster.  The 2017 hurricane season was one of the worst on record. Among the hardest places hit were Puerto Rico and my home, the Virgin Islands of the United States, which not only lost power across the islands, but many vital pieces of infrastructure were heavily damaged and destroyed, and, most tragically, lives were lost.  This disaster significantly impacted the Virgin Islands, destroying the island's infrastructure, with the loss of our only two hospitals, multiple schools, thousands of homes, and it left residents without electricity for a period of 9 months.  The total damage to the Virgin Islands is estimated at $10.8 billion--$10.8 billion in a place that only has a $1 billion budget--$6.9 billion for infrastructure, $2.3 billion for housing, and $1.5 million for the economy.  Diverting disaster funds from this community would create a security risk and make them even more vulnerable.  Mr. Speaker, shifting disaster relief funds appropriated by this body from my district and others impaired by the 2017-2018 natural disasters would create a catastrophic economic disaster. Disaster funding from the Army Corps was critical to disaster recovery, including power restoration, studies, repairs, and construction projects in the Virgin Islands and other territories and States impacted by the national disasters.  The Army Corps of Engineers, however, has barged more than 25,000 cubic yards of construction and demolition debris from the territory. However, approximately more than 6,000, almost 7,000, cubic yards remain on the island, still to be removed.  There is still so much work left undone. Individuals are still without roofs. After extensive debate and discussion with FEMA, the roof repair program is just now, a year and a half later, repairing the thousands of roofs and homes destroyed.  The STEP roof program has been extended to March 1. The STEP program debris removal is still in progress throughout the territory.  The hurricanes left not one but two hospitals overwhelmed with debris and destroyed--our only two hospitals--and, now, worksheets still have not been approved by FEMA for the rebuilding of those hospitals. The modular hospital is still not in place.  Students have only recently, in this month, moved into the modular classrooms. Can you imagine?  School reconstruction has not begun. Our communities still have a long way to go to get in the disaster recovery and rebuilding process.  Mr. Speaker, nowhere else in this country would this be allowed. This would not be allowed in any of your colleagues' homes.  However, before and after the storm, Virgin Islanders put their heads down and did the work. They pitched in and helped one another because that is all we had at that time, and the benevolence of other people, until you, Congress, until you, colleagues, gave them the disaster funding that was needed to rebuild.  Mr. Speaker, unlike other places, the Virgin Islands doesn't have five or six Members of the House or millions of constituents living in your own districts. The Virgin Islands didn't have thousands of people on the news media or chefs or playwrights bringing musicals to our island to draw attention to the devastation in our home.  The Virgin Islands had me, and I pray they have you--they have you, Mr. Speaker; they have you, colleagues--to continue the fight for them, for these Americans, to tell the White House that they should not shift disaster funding to build a wall away from Americans living in territories for something that a foreign country was to pay for in the beginning."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize February as National Children's Dental Health Month and to raise awareness around the critically important issue of access to quality dental care for our Nation's children.  The most prevalent chronic infectious disease among children in the United States is tooth decay. This disease is responsible for countless health problems in children and more than 51 million hours lost at school every year.  However, this disease is preventable with basic dental care. Sadly, even with improvements in recent years, too many children are not able to access the quality dental care they need to simply stay healthy.  I have a long history of advocating for increased access to dental care for all, particularly our Nation's young people. I have often said that our children are the living messengers we send to a future we will never see. That means that we must do everything in our power to ensure that they are healthy and given every opportunity to succeed.  Today, I also rise to share the story of a young Maryland boy named Deamonte Driver. He died because of a lack of access to basic dental care.  In February of 2007, 12-year-old Deamonte Driver came home from school with a simple headache, which had started as a toothache. His mother worked hard to make ends meet with all kinds of low-paying jobs. She searched for a dentist who would accept Medicaid for her children, but she found no dentist who would care for children's teeth.  Deamonte's mother took him to the emergency room, where he received medication for pain, a sinus infection, and a dental abscess. Unfortunately, that was not enough. The bacteria from Deamonte's cavity spread to his brain, and, at 12 years old, Deamonte Driver died--12 years old. Deamonte could be alive today if it were not for the lack of a simple procedure and the early removal of one tooth.  Deamonte's story is one we must never, ever forget. We must imprint it in the DNA of every cell of our brains. Fortunately, we have made great strides in access to dental care, particularly for children, since Deamonte's death in 2007. Passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act and the Affordable Care Act have filled the gaps in dental care for children who are eligible for these programs. This has given many children across this great Nation access to dental care and many families greater peace of mind regarding their children's health.  Maryland has also made significant progress in access to dental healthcare over the last several years and now stands as a national model thanks, sadly, to Deamonte Driver.  Through the work of many groups and organizations, more Maryland children are visiting a dentist, and dental health is a priority in our great State. In 2017, almost 70 percent of the Maryland children enrolled in Medicaid received at least one dental care service.  The Maryland Department of Health also funds specific programs, such as the Oral Disease and Injury Prevention Program and the Dental Sealants Program, that cares for and educates thousands of children, including right there at the schools.  Yet, even with these improvements in access to education, there is more that must be done to protect dental health in honor of that little boy, Deamonte Driver. That is why I am proud to rise in support of dental care during Children's Dental Health Month and encourage everyone to take advantage of oral health education, screenings, preventive care, and restorative services in their community.  It is also why I plan to reintroduce my Comprehensive Dental Reform Act this Congress, which, among other things, would provide comprehensive dental coverage to all Medicare, Medicaid, and VA beneficiaries and make dental care an essential health benefit for adults under the Affordable Care Act.  Dental services must no longer be thought of as an optional health benefit for children or adults."

We recognize the incredible progress that they made possible and the work that we still need to do to ensure that opportunity isn't something that is determined by the color of our skin.  We honor the courageous and determined everyday men and women, like Medgar Evers and Fannie Lou Hamer, who challenged every barrier in our society and set a path for the activists of today, like Patricia Nickols-Butler, the CEO of Community Action Partnership. She has dedicated her entire life to making sure that not one single family in San Bernardino County is left behind by providing them with the resources they need to succeed.  We honor educators like Maxine Smith, who fought discrimination in our classrooms to give every child an equal opportunity to learn, and leaders in the Inland Empire like Dr. Soraya M. Coley, the president of Cal Poly Pomona, who is committed to helping every student reach his and her full potential; trailblazers like San Bernardino County's first Black schoolteacher, Dorothy Inghram, who taught every child to reach for the stars and never give up, or Dr. Eric Bishop, the vice president of student services at Chaffey College, who has been a guiding force for every student when the going got tough.  We honor the countless Black veterans who fought for our freedoms in every war, from the Revolutionary War to our current conflicts in the Middle East, and law enforcement officers who put their own lives on the line every single day to keep our communities safe. We salute Chief Derek Williams of the Ontario Police Department, whose commitment to service began in the Air Force.  We honor the public servants like Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, the first African American woman elected to Congress, who showed us what it meant to be ``unbought and unbossed'' and made way for the historic number of women running for office today; and Wilmer Amina Carter, the first African American woman to represent San Bernardino County in the California State Assembly. Throughout her time in office, she worked to improve the lives of people in her community by passing laws to strengthen healthcare, safety, transportation, and help create jobs.  We honor the moral leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who made America listen--listen--to its conscience and sacrificed his life to advance civil rights for each and every one of us.  And we honor Pastor Chuck Singleton of Loveland Church in Ontario and Rialto, whose words provide comfort and healing here at home and abroad through his humanitarian work.  The successes of African American leaders reach far and wide and are deeply entrenched in each of our lives. May we all take the time to uplift the immeasurable contributions that African American leaders have made to our country this month and every single day of the year. May we renew our commitment and join them to pick up the fight for equality, opportunity, and justice for all Americans."

It is important that we always take note because, sadly, genocide and anti-Semitism continues to exist in the 21st century. As the philosopher George Santayana once explained: Those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it.  Yes. An important episode in the history of the Holocaust is the story of Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a Portuguese diplomat, who was the consular general in Bordeaux, France, in the late 1930s, 1940, and 1941. As a Portuguese diplomat in Bordeaux, France, at the outset of the Second World War, Sousa Mendes is credited with saving the lives of tens of thousands of European Jews fleeing the Holocaust.  As a proud Portuguese American and the co-chair of the Congressional Portuguese Caucus, I am glad that later this year we will be hosting a screening of the film, ``Disobedience: The Sousa Mendes Story,'' in partnership with the Sousa Mendes Foundation. We must learn from our history so that the atrocities of the past are never repeated in the future. We remember, and we pledge to never, ever forget.  Speaking of atrocities, sadly, they do continue to exist around the world. This week, we will have an opportunity, as Congress, to go on record to discuss the challenges of the civil war going on in Yemen and America's participation in that effort.  It is high time Congress reassert itself in terms of our checks and balances. We have abdicated our role far too often in terms of declaring what America's actions and interventions will be like around the world. This week, we will have an opportunity to go on record on the atrocities that are taking place in Yemen and, hopefully, be a positive force for change.  In addition to our efforts this week, a looming deadline on February 15 is before us, and that is whether we will reach an agreement on proposed border security and continue to fund this government to the end of our fiscal year. It is wrong, and it is irresponsible to ever shut down government.  In the 14 years that I have been a Member of Congress, I have never voted to shut down government. It is not just the hundreds and thousands of Federal employees who are at risk, who have home payments, car payments, and other obligations, but all the other contractors and people who do business with the Federal Government or who are indirectly impacted.  We have held hearings throughout my district. I hope that before the end of this week, we will reach a bipartisan agreement on border security. I hope that we will continue to ensure that government is not shut down and that we go about the business of working on this year's budget, hopefully, reaching an agreement to reduce the cost of prescription drugs; to reduce the cost of healthcare; to protect people's insurance for preexisting conditions; and maybe, just maybe, reach an agreement on a bipartisan infrastructure package. That is the business at hand, and that is what we ought to be focused on. Finally, on an upbeat note, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the University of California at Merced in my district being named one of the country's universities of the year by Education Dive, which honors education's top innovators.  One of the newest research universities in the entire country, it is a testament to UC Merced's forward-thinking approach, which has been integral in increasing opportunity to improve the quality of education for California's San Joaquin Valley and the entire system of the University of California.  UC Merced prides itself in having the largest share of low-income, first-generation, and underrepresented students among all the University of California's campuses. It is the first minority-majority campus in California, with over 8,000 students.  It has been a pleasure to watch the university grow over the last 13 years and an honor to meet its educators, students, and alumni who make up a tight, close-knit community.  Go Bobcats."

I am a proud small business owner, and I know for a fact that businesses pay wages according to their employees' skill set. In a free enterprise environment, a growing economy grows jobs which grows opportunities which grows wages.  I believe you reward a good day's work, but my Democratic colleagues don't want to believe that we can produce economic opportunity in concert with growing wages without the government interfering.  Signing the front of the paycheck and providing folks with a good job has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. That is why I oppose the Raise the Wage Act. This one-size-fits-all, top-down government regulation will destroy millions of hard-earned jobs and restrain our growing economy.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, on Monday the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 122, providing for consideration of H.J. Res. 37, under a structured rule.  The rule provides 1 hour of debate, equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. It also provides same-day authority for fiscal year 2019 appropriations measures, suspension authority, and authority for the Appropriations chair to insert explanatory language into the Congressional Record, all through February 17.  Madam Speaker, the Constitution specifically empowers Congress with the responsibility to declare war; and for more than 4 years, there has been a Saudi-led, U.S.-supported conflict happening in Yemen that is a war by any logical definition.  Nearly all of the bombs that have fallen say the same thing: ``Made in the United States of America.'' They fall on weddings. They fall on hospitals and on homes. They fall on funerals, refugee camps, and school buses. It is an aerial bombing campaign that hammers children, families, and civilian neighborhoods every single day.  The U.S. military has supported this reign of terror with logistics, intelligence, ground support, midair refueling of bombers, and the sale of bombs and munitions dropped on Yemen.  The Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project estimates that more than 60,000 civilians and combatants have been killed in Yemen over the last 2 years. This total is increasing by more than 2,000 people every single month.  Madam Speaker, 85,000 children under the age of 5 have died from hunger and disease; 18 million people there are food insecure; and 75 percent of Yemen's population is in need of humanitarian assistance.  The United Nations has said Yemen is suffering from the fastest growing cholera epidemic ever recorded, as well as the world's biggest food emergency.  These are not abstract numbers. These are human lives--tens of thousands of children lost.  Given all of this, Americans would be forgiven for believing that Congress actually declared our involvement in this war, but we have not. We abdicated our responsibility to the executive branch instead, across multiple Presidents, Democratic and Republican alike.  Some may dance around this fact by calling what is happening there a conflict, but let's call it what it is. It is a war. And our involvement in this war is unconstitutional.  Despite being one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, others, like the President, don't mention Yemen at all. In his State of the Union Address last week, President Trump, right here in this Chamber, discussed his ineffective wall with Mexico, encouraged Congress to stop upholding our oversight responsibilities over his administration, and highlighted how Americans will once again be sent into space.  It was the longest State of the Union Address in nearly 20 years, but the President didn't utter the word ``Yemen''--not once. He couldn't even spare 2 minutes to update this Congress and the American people on our involvement there. Are you kidding me?  The President may not want to talk about it, but a free press has been delivering the grisly details day after day, in spite of the roadblocks the Saudis have thrown up to limit media access to Yemen.  Perhaps none spoke more vocally than the late Saudi dissident and Washington Post reporter Jamal Khashoggi. He called for an end to this conflict in a column titled: ``Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Must Restore Dignity to His Country--By Ending Yemen's Cruel War.'' That was published in The Washington Post just weeks before his death.  Let's be honest. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi was a murder. All evidence makes it clear that it was likely at the behest of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. A recent New York Times article even revealed that American intelligence agencies intercepted a conversation where bin Salman threatened to use a bullet on Mr. Khashoggi if he didn't end his criticism of Saudi Arabia and this conflict.  Madam Speaker, is this really the kind of regime Congress wants as our Nation's partner?  There was even a report that Saudis and the UAE are transferring American-made weapons to al-Qaida fighters and other rebels. This would expose sensitive national security technology that could endanger the lives of our military.  President Trump has said of Saudi Arabia: They have been a great ally.  Really? Really? This is a country that is responsible for killing and dismembering a Washington Post reporter.  Madam Speaker, if this is what the President considers a friend, then I would hate to see what he considers a foe.  Even Republicans are angry with this administration's apparent affinity towards Saudi Arabia. Politico reported: ``Senate Republicans are fuming at President Donald Trump for telling lawmakers that he would disregard a law requiring a report to Congress determining who is responsible for the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.''  No Member of Congress should be okay with a President showing such disregard for the laws that we pass, and we certainly shouldn't look the other way when it comes to the murder of a resident of the United States.  I say to all my friends on the other side of the aisle: If you want to send a message that United States foreign policy respects human rights, join with us on this resolution.  Prior Republican Congresses have used every legislative trick in the book to prevent this debate. They even took the unprecedented step of stripping war powers resolutions related to our involvement in Yemen of their privileged status--not once but twice.  These tactics may have delayed us, but they did not deter us. Speaker Boehner may have been content ceding our constitutional duties to the executive branch. Speaker Ryan may also have been happy to do so. Thankfully, Speaker Pelosi is not. She is empowering this Congress to do its job.  I am glad that, under her leadership, this Congress has strengthened its political will and is reasserting our Article I constitutional responsibilities. This is the system our Founders intended, and it is what our constituents expect of all of us.  This Congress is not turning a blind eye to U.S. involvement in Yemen. This Congress is not looking away from the civil war the world sees unfolding on its television screens.  I want to thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus and, especially, Congressman Khanna for leading this matter. Congressman Khanna has been the conscience of Congress when it comes to our involvement in Yemen. He has pushed us again and again and again to do something as these atrocities mount.  We not only have a constitutional responsibility to pass the underlying resolution, we have a moral responsibility.  No Congress should be complicit in the bombing of children or the bombing of water treatment plants during a cholera outbreak or the decimation of hospitals during a humanitarian catastrophe or the creation of a blockade that leads thousands of people to die by starvation.  Considering this measure in the opening weeks of this Congress represents a clear break from the old ways of doing business, where matters of war and peace were routinely swept under the rug.  I am proud that this is a structured rule that makes in order a bipartisan amendment and a minority amendment. The bipartisan amendment is mine, and, among other things, it says that nothing in this resolution may be considered as authorizing the use of military force and nothing may alter the 2001 AUMF because, as important as this measure is, it is also targeted specifically to our involvement only in and affecting the war in Yemen.  It is something Republicans and Democrats agree on. Members ranging from conservative Republican   Tom Massie to progressive Congresswoman Barbara Lee have signed on as cosponsors. It should not be controversial.  Madam Speaker, there is bipartisan agreement that the U.S. involvement in Yemen needs to end, so I urge all my colleagues to seize this opportunity that we have fought for for so long. Vote ``yes'' on this rule and the underlying joint resolution. Let's finally end our Nation's complicity in the greatest humanitarian crisis taking place on our planet today.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I want to thank my good friend, Chairman McGovern, for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Normally, Madam Speaker, I would be agreeing with my good friend, Mr. McGovern, on the issue of congressional war powers, and, frankly, I want to applaud his efforts over the years to reassert congressional war powers.  It is a responsibility, in my view and, I know, my friend's view, that Congress has abdicated and one which we must work to reclaim in the weeks and months ahead. I commit to work with my friend, as I have in the past, to do just that in the future. But, in my view, this particular issue is not about congressional war powers.  Madam Speaker, we had a spirited debate on this joint resolution in the Rules Committee Monday night, and I expect that today's debate will be just as spirited. The reason is because this measure concerns one of the most important of Congress' powers: the power under Article I of the Constitution to declare war and to say when, where, and with whom the American Armed Forces will be committed to combat.  In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which is intended to give Congress and the President procedures to follow when committing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities and to give Congress a method to instruct the President to remove U.S. forces from hostilities.  Today, the majority is bringing up H.J. Res. 37, a resolution ostensibly arising under Congress' powers under the War Powers Resolution, to instruct the President to remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen. Specifically, this refers to United States support for key allies, a coalition led by Saudi Arabia in their intervention in the civil war in Yemen against the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.  Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, I believe this resolution is fatally flawed, misstates the facts, and will not accomplish what the majority is promising. For that reason, I oppose this rule and oppose this joint resolution.  Let's start with the text of the resolution.  Section 2 of the resolution directs the President to ``remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen except United States Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaida or associated forces.''  Of course, the problem with this resolution is that, under the terms of the War Powers Resolution, American Armed Forces are not currently engaged in hostilities. Hostilities, under the War Powers Resolution, means firing weapons or dropping bombs.  As we heard on Monday night at rules, the United States is presently providing assistance to the Saudi-led coalition that falls short of actual hostilities. We are providing intelligence and logistics support to an ally, but that is a far cry from the threshold necessary to be considered hostilities for the purposes of the War Powers Resolution.  This came up during Monday night's Rules Committee debate. I note that even Representative Connolly, who spoke in favor of this resolution at the Foreign Affairs Committee a few weeks ago, stated that ``the United States is not technically involved on the ground in hostilities.''  If we are not ``technically involved'' in hostilities--we don't have troops on the ground, we don't have flights in the air, and we are not engaging in combat missions of any kind against the Houthis in Yemen--then what does this resolution actually accomplish?  The majority attempts to get around this by redefining hostilities to mean ``in-flight refueling non-United States aircraft conducting missions as part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.''  Even if I did accept, for the sake of argument, that this is a legitimate definition--and I don't--this is still a false statement. The United States is not currently providing Saudi Arabia with in-flight refueling assistance and has not since early November of last year. That fact is just one of the many problems with the resolution.  I do point out the last administration certainly did that. It is actually this administration that canceled that procedure, which it inherited from the Obama administration.  But even if the statement, again, were accurate, I believe the majority's resolution raises significant questions that should give us pause.  Across the globe, the United States has security agreements with 117 countries, including Saudi Arabia and other countries in the Saudi-led coalition. We as a nation and the President of the United States have obligations under those security agreements, including to provide them with support when they find themselves in combat situations. The resolution the majority is asking us to consider today is putting all of those security agreements--all 117 of them--into jeopardy.  When the President provides assistance short of hostilities to allies and to countries with whom the United States has a security agreement, the President is generally well within his or her rights as Commander in Chief to do so and well within his or her statutory authority to do so.  It is only when American troops enter hostilities that the War Powers Resolution applies, and today, in Yemen, American forces are not involved in hostilities.  I think that the majority should sit back and think about the possible consequences of this resolution. For allies around the globe, this resolution should give them pause; and, for our adversaries, this resolution should give them hope.  For the first time, the United States Congress would be saying that the President of the United States no longer has the authority to provide assistance short of hostilities that we have agreed to under our security agreements with these countries. For our allies and NATO, this would put in jeopardy our commitment to the collective defense of Europe. For our allies in the Pacific, like South Korea and Japan, it would put into question our ability to continue to provide support in the event of a conflict with North Korea.  For potential adversaries like Russia or Iran, this resolution provides the hope that America will not live up to its security commitments and will not support our allies during their time of need.  Perhaps most disturbingly, it would put our ongoing security arrangements with the state of Israel in question. In 1973, shortly before the War Powers Resolution was passed, Israel was subject to a surprise attack. During the resulting Yom Kippur War, while Israel was fighting for its survival, the United States launched an effort to resupply Israel. The United States military airlifted supplies, ammunition, and vehicles to Israel, helping to ensure their continued survival. However, we were never engaged in hostilities. We never committed forces to combat.  If the majority has its say, U.S. assistance to Israel under similar circumstances could be put in jeopardy. Under the type of resolution the majority is putting forward today, Israel would have good cause to question the U.S. commitment to that nation and to question our commitment to providing Israel with support in the future.  Should the United States provide Israel with the support it needs, our allies would have good reason to fear that a portion of the House of Representatives would try to shut off the tap by putting forward a resolution like this. I suggest to my friends that they rethink whether the War Powers Resolution should or even can be used in this way.  Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the rule and the underlying legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time."

I mean, it is written here for everybody to see.  Secondly, my good friend talked about the consequences of moving this legislation forward. Let me tell you what the consequences of not moving this resolution forward are. It means that we are totally content to sit back and say nothing and not admit that our government has its fingerprints all over one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. It means that we will be complicit in the continuing destruction and murder in Yemen.  If this country stands for anything, if the United States of America stands for anything, we need to stand out loud and foursquare for human rights. For too long, especially under this administration, human rights have become an afterthought.  What makes us great is the fact that we do have a high standard when it comes to human rights, that we are there to speak up for those who are being persecuted and those who are being murdered.  This is a statement, this is a signal, to the administration and to the Saudi Government that when it comes to human rights, there are people in this Congress--hopefully, a bipartisan group of people in this Congress--who are not going to be silent, who are going to demand that things change.

They have discussed this over the months, and I have been pleased to join them in this effort.  Madam Speaker, U.S. bombs are bombing school buses of 40 children. U.S. bombs are bombing those in Yemen who are innocent citizens. The violence through bombing has been facilitated with U.S. resources. This is a demand that is without parallel of its necessity.  The question is whether we are engaged without the authorization of the United States Congress, whether we have declared war against Yemen. If the answer is no, then this resolution is appropriate.  Yemen is the poorest or one of the poorest countries in the world. This resolution clearly says that we should stop the hostilities against the Houthi forces. More importantly, we should stop being used by the Saudi forces.  By the way, having gone to Yemen, I know that at least a decade ago, Saudi closed its doors to the Yemen young men, who could find no work in Yemen because of its poverty, to go into Saudi to work there. Without that opportunity, all we ceded was poverty and violence. Now, because of the conflict, we have been bombing Yemen citizens for many years.  This is a constructive resolution. It does not violate the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. It is one that says that we must take our forces and impact out of Yemen.  Let me also say that I know that we will discuss this further, but I do want to add that it is crucial to take note that we have an agreement on border security and funding the different agencies, so that we do not hold our Federal employees hostage and we don't shut the government.  This resolution, coming back to this resolution dealing with directing the removal of Armed Forces from Yemen, is constructive work of the Democratic Caucus and Democratic Members. We hope our Republican Members will join us in doing the right thing in removing the impact of the United States forces in Yemen.  Stop bombing children."

You get a very different look at what goes on in Congress then, because it is not everybody poking each other with sharp sticks. It is thoughtful, deliberate public servants who are really very close to finding a common way forward that is going to make all Americans proud.  That is my frustration with this resolution today and why I hope my colleagues will reject it.  My friend from Massachusetts, the chairman of the Rules Committee, is working very hard to open up the Rules Committee, add more voices, bring more of a constructive process to the House of Representatives. I admire him for it. I appreciate his effort, and I support him every step of the way.  But we are in some bad habits here on the floor of the House, and we are in the habit of finding ways to make important distinctions instead of making important agreements.  My friend from Massachusetts said just a few moments ago that not to do this resolution is to do nothing, and that is a false choice. There is unanimity on the floor of this House that we must stand up for Article I, that we must stand up against an overreaching Article II executive branch, that we must speak with one voice on issues of international affairs.  Instead of bringing a bill to the floor that would have brought us together so that we do speak with one voice on behalf of 330 million Americans, we are bringing a bill to the floor that is going to pass on a largely party-line vote. We have done that time and time again in these first 45 days.  We did that with veteran housing last week. We took a bill that passed unanimously in the last Congress to both provide childcare for our veterans and pay for that childcare and, instead, this year, we brought it back where we are going to have to cut some veteran accounts in order to fund that childcare going forward. It made that motion to recommit a party-line vote.  We did that with recognition of Federal employees, Madam Speaker, where we are trying to recognize their service and their sacrifice. Instead of bringing a bill that we would have agreed on unanimously, we brought a bill that divided this institution and made us speak with two voices.  This is another missed opportunity today. My friend from Massachusetts doesn't have control over this entire institution. He can't work his will on this entire institution. He is doing what he can on the House Rules Committee to open up the process and lead to a better product.  Flawed processes produce flawed products. Divided bills on the floor of this House do nothing to unify a divided nation.  We have opportunities. There are plenty of things on which we disagree. When we have things like this on which we agree, I think we need to work harder, Madam Speaker, to bring ourselves together, put our divisions behind us, rather than highlight those divisions in the name of political gain.  This could have been a unifying moment, not just for this Congress, but for the global political entirety as they see America speak with one voice to say, when troops are in harm's way, the United States Congress, not Article II, controls that destiny. I hope we will get to that point sooner rather than later. We only get so many chances, and each time we waste one, it becomes harder."

But on this bill in particular, the bill that we are taking up here today is virtually identical to the bill that passed the United States Senate last year with a bipartisan vote. That bill that passed the Senate last year was prevented by the then-Republican majority from even being considered on this House floor on at least two occasions. So I can appreciate the fact the gentleman may not agree with the statement we are trying to make today or the bill that we are putting forward here today, but the process, I think, has been pretty good.  It just had a hearing in the committee of jurisdiction. It had a markup. We had a long hearing in the Rules Committee. All the germane amendments were made in order, a bipartisan amendment and a Republican amendment, and we are going to debate it here today under regular order.

I am not here to defend the Houthi rebels or, certainly, to cover up for any Iranian meddling here, but I will say this: We know that 85,000 children under the age of 5 have died of hunger and disease since 2015. Eighty percent of all children in Yemen require humanitarian assistance, according to UNICEF, the U.N.'s children's agency.  We need to do everything in our power to encourage a political solution to this terrible humanitarian crisis. I mean, this is unbelievable. Every person who cares about human rights should be outraged by what is going on.

The United States support for Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen, with no authorization from Congress, has resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of Yemeni civilians. The U.S.-Saudi coalition has dropped bombs on children in school buses, on people in markets, and on families who are celebrating weddings.  They have left millions of Yemeni people on the brink of death from famine, disease, starvation, a lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and healthcare. This has created the worst humanitarian crisis in a generation.  Earlier this week, the Trump administration threatened to veto this critical legislation should it pass Congress, this legislation that would end U.S. support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, by spreading blatant lies. They have said that this legislation draws ``constitutional concerns,'' and they say it would ``affect our ability to prevent the spread of violent extremist organizations.''  But here is the truth. First, the United States' support for this war in Yemen is unconstitutional. Congress has not authorized it. Second, Saudi Arabia is not our ally, and continued U.S. support for this war in Yemen is strengthening terrorist groups like al-Qaida.  A recent CNN report documented how Saudi Arabia is literally taking the U.S. weapons that have been provided to them in this war in Yemen and handing them off to al-Qaida on the ground in Yemen, the very same terrorist group that attacked us on 9/11.  Or to speak of the fact that Saudi Arabia is continuing to spend billions of dollars spreading their Wahhabi-Salafist ideology that is fueling terrorist organizations like ISIS and al-Qaida, causing them to grow stronger.  Congress must take action today. We must reclaim our constitutional responsibility and pass this legislation to stop supporting Saudi Arabia's genocidal war in Yemen and strengthening these terrorist groups that threaten us. "

Madam Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, we will move to bring up H.R. 336, the Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act of 2019. I urge the House to vote on this bill, whose companion passed the Senate with bipartisan support this month.  Bringing this legislation to the floor, Madam Speaker, is not a partisan maneuver; it is an urgent matter of national security that requires action by this House.  H.R. 336 includes two bills that enhance our security cooperation with Israel and Jordan, key U.S. allies in the Middle East that are active in the fight against terrorist organizations in the region.  H.R. 336 also reaffirms America's unwavering support for Israel with the Combating BDS Act, a bill that empowers State and local governments to counter discriminatory anti-Israel boycotts.  There should be no doubt, Madam Speaker, about the bipartisan nature of each of these bills. The Israel security assistance legislation passed the House by voice vote in September. The Jordan defense cooperation bill passed the House by voice vote last February. The Syria sanctions bill passed the House by voice vote just last month. And last Congress, Senator Marco Rubio's Combating BDS Act gained the support of Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and a number of other Democrats on the Senate side.  Most Democratic Members continue to stand with Republicans in rejecting the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, BDS, campaign. These Members understand, as the Republicans do, that this is a campaign that too often seeks to delegitimize and demonize Israel. So, Madam Speaker, why not hold a vote on H.R. 336 that contains a bill called the Combating BDS Act?  BDS is a campaign whose adherents have time and time again revealed their anti-Semitic motives. This is a campaign that directs its followers to avoid certain products merely because they are made in Israel. Armed with economic warfare tactics, supporters of BDS seek to isolate and punish the only Jewish state. That, Madam Speaker, is the dictionary definition of discrimination.  Opponents of the Combating BDS Act often cite First Amendment objections to this legislation, but the truth is, this bill would not prohibit individuals or companies from speaking out in support of the BDS movement, nor would it prohibit them from boycotting Israel. The Combating BDS Act applies to entities, such as companies, and their conduct.  This bill cements what should be an obvious point: States have the right not to contract with companies that engage in discriminatory conduct against Israel."

At its core, the Combating BDS Act protects and empowers States in their efforts to counter a hateful anti-Israel movement.  There is no reason not to hold a vote on H.R. 336, which also includes legislation that authorizes security assistance to Israel and extends our defense partnership with Jordan. Helping our key allies in the Middle East ensure their security should not be controversial.  Madam Speaker, we are now at a moment in this House, at a moment in this body where we are facing real anti-Semitism from the other side of the aisle. It is time that we all come together as a body in a bipartisan manner to stand against anti-Semitism, to condemn it, to ensure that everyone understands it has no place in this House, in this body, or in our public discourse.  These bills that we are offering today, if the previous question is defeated, are those bills that will recognize and symbolize American leadership and define American leadership. I hope Democrats will choose our security and our closest allies over partisanship and bring H.R. 336 to a vote."

First, on process, just so everybody understands, we are bringing a bill to the floor today under a structured rule that has a bipartisan amendment and a Republican amendment.  What my Republican friends are suggesting is that they want to bring up a bill, and all amendments are blocked, with the exception of one if offered by a Republican, sight unseen.  Boy, old habits die hard. This is the way they were in the majority. And thank God they are no longer in the majority, but, wow, what a lousy process this is.  Then secondly, I want to say that we are having a debate about Yemen, about one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, where the Saudi Government is bombing weddings and funerals and school buses, where thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of people are on the verge of starvation, where children are dying every day.  The previous question has nothing to do with Yemen. I mean, it is as if this entire horrific catastrophe that is now unfolding in Yemen doesn't even exist. I mean, how sad.  This is an important issue, and we have a responsibility to debate and to vote on this issue, because we have been involved in supplying so much assistance to the Saudi Government, and not even a mention, not even a mention of this.  Maybe this doesn't matter to my Republican friends. Maybe they are perfectly fine turning a blind eye to this horrific horror show that is happening in Yemen. But I am going to tell you, I think most people in this country, when they are made aware of what is going on and they are made aware of our involvement, are horrified. This is not what the United States Government is about.  So, in any event, it is a little bit disappointing.

I want to just note the difference procedurally of what happened. Every time we introduced this in the last Congress, Speaker Ryan didn't allow a vote. He tied a vote on Yemen with a vote on endangered wolves.  In contrast, Chairman McGovern, not only is he allowing a vote on the resolution of Yemen, he is allowing a vote on an amendment that Representative Buck has offered that I oppose vehemently, that I went to him and I said, ``This is going to gut the entire resolution.''  What did Chairman McGovern do? Did he say, ``Oh, we will go behind closed doors. Don't worry. We won't allow a vote?'' No. He said, ``We are going to bring it to a vote on this floor.''  I said, ``Do we have the votes?''  He said, ``I don't know.''  Why are we bringing it to the floor? Because that is a democracy. That is what we are supposed to do in a democracy.  We will have the votes. You know how I know we are going to have the votes and it is going to be a bipartisan vote? Because when Lindsay Graham is quoted saying he may vote in support of the resolution, you know there is going to be an overwhelming vote.  I want to just address one point, because Representative Cole is one of the more thoughtful Members here and I take what he says very seriously, but on the War Powers Act, we just disagree. When you read the plain reading of the War Powers, it says that the United States Armed Forces cannot be assigned to coordinate, participate, or accompany any foreign government's military when they are in hostilities. Madam Speaker, our forces are coordinating with the Saudi forces. I concede to Members we don't have troops there, but the War Powers Resolution was written broadly, precisely because we wanted Congress to have a say.  And, Representative Cole, I am convinced if one of our allies, like Israel or another country, were attacked; I have enough confidence in this body that we would make the right decision. This is a matter of the Congress' right to have a say on matters of war and peace, and I thank Chairman McGovern for bringing this for a vote."

But the Commander in Chief historically has had broad authority to assist countries that we have agreements and arrangements with that he thinks are important in our own security, short of committing troops into combat. I think that is precisely what he is doing.  Frankly, that is what his predecessor did.

This amendment would change H.R. 336 to mirror the text of the Senate companion bill S. 1.  S. 1 passed the Senate just last week by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 77-23.  I introduced this House companion in January.  This package of bipartisan bills from last Congress bolsters the security of America and our allies in the Middle East.  This bill authorizes U.S. security assistance to Israel over a 10-year period and updates key elements of our security cooperation to ensure that Israel can respond to the significant threats it faces from its neighbors.  It also reauthorizes the United States-Jordan Defense Cooperation Act, allowing Jordan to remain eligible to receive special treatment for the transfer of U.S. defense articles and services.  Jordan is a critical ally in the fight against ISIS and other extremist groups. We need to make sure that they are adequately equipped to help maintain stability in the Middle East.  H.R. 336 also contains the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act. This bill passed the House earlier this year. It should have been law a long time ago. This act will impose long-overdue sanctions against Syria's Assad regime and its backers, including Iran and Russia, for their egregious human rights abuses.  Finally, this bill empowers State and local governments in the United States to counter the anti-Israel Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions, otherwise known as BDS, movement's discriminatory economic warfare against Israel.  These provisions have already passed the Senate with bipartisan support. I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting ``no'' on the previous question in order to consider this important bill to shore up U.S. interests and allies in the Middle East and take action against Assad's murderous regime."

Madam Speaker, I want to begin by acknowledging the extraordinary leadership of the chairman of the Rules Committee and this very transparent and open process.  I stand to support, strongly, H.J. Res. 37, which directs the President to remove American troops from their role in hostilities in Yemen.  By taking up this War Powers Resolution, the House is, finally, reasserting our constitutional authority and responsibility over American military actions and sending an important message both to the Saudi-led coalition and to the Trump administration.  The Iranian-backed Houthis have acted with complete disregard for civilian lives in Yemen, blocking humanitarian aid and mounting attacks into Saudi Arabian cities. There is no question that they bear much of the blame for the current humanitarian crisis.  However, for nearly 4 years, the Saudi and Emirati-backed coalition has used American bombs, American planes with American logistical support, and, until recently, American refueling to further a conflict that has cost thousands of civilian lives and led to a humanitarian crisis in the country. There is no question in my mind that American involvement, to date, has exceeded the congressional authorization that exists to combat terrorists in the region. For too long, the United States has been directly involved in this war without proper congressional authorization or oversight.  This bill, which passed the Senate last year with bipartisan support, specifically exempts actions that target al-Qaida and any other terrorist activity.  My colleagues opposing this effort seem to forget that we have a responsibility under the Constitution to exercise our oversight authority over American military engagement. Nothing in this legislation prevents the administration from coming to Congress and presenting a strategy and asking for authorization to involve our military in Yemen. That is not something I would support, but they did not even try to make the case.  Instead, we have become embroiled in a humanitarian nightmare and backed a flawed military engagement with no end in sight, all without proper authorization or oversight. It seems pretty obvious that it is time to exert our proper role as Congress.  H.J. Res. 37 is an important first step of what I hope will be a concerted effort to bring the war in Yemen to an end and to reestablish Congress' role in overseeing our military's engagements overseas.

The House should immediately bring this legislation up, which is a bipartisan legislative package that would help others fight back against the BDS movement, protect U.S. security in the Middle East by strengthening our alliances with Israel and Jordan, and sanction bad actors like Assad.  The Senate version of this bill, S. 1, passed with strong bipartisan support, 77-23.  The major point of contention for some, regarding this package, is the Combating BDS Act of 2019, a bipartisan bill with over 100 cosponsors last Congress, that would help stop the BDS movement.  It is okay to have a reasonable, legitimate concern with any government, including Israel, as well as our own, but, keep in mind, the founder of BDS was blatantly anti-Semitic, and, on college campuses all across our entire country, we have college students who are being targeted by blatant anti-Semitism in the name of BDS.  The founder of the BDS movement was a raging anti-Semite, who once said: ``We are witnessing the rapid demise of Zionism, and nothing can be done to save it, for Zionism is intent on killing itself. I, for one, support euthanasia.'' That is not all he has said.  This bill would simply allow State and local governments to have the right to counter the BDS movement by ending contracts with companies that boycott Israel. This bill does not impede the right of any American to boycott or criticize Israel. Instead, this bill protects States' rights to divest from countries that boycott Israel and from lawsuits driven by the ACLU.  The BDS movement is designed to hurt Israel by encouraging companies to boycott Israeli goods. The BDS movement is consumed by efforts to delegitimize and demonize Israel.  Numerous incidents are highlighted in my resolution, H. Res. 72, condemning this behavior. For example, at NYU, after the student government passed a resolution supporting BDS, they had to close the Center for Jewish Life in response to threatening Twitter posts by a student who expressed ``a desire for Zionists to die.''  There are so many other examples on college campuses all across our country. Where the BDS grows, anti-Semitism follows. Yet some Members in the House openly support this movement. House Democrats are holding up this major bipartisan legislation.  This bill would provide $3.3 billion in security assistance to Israel and authorize the 2016 MOU to guarantee Israel's security for the next 10 years by providing advanced capabilities to protect our greatest ally.  This bill strengthens Jordan's ability to promote regional security and stability by enhancing Jordan's military capacity in the sale of defense articles.  This bill also sanctions those who provide financial assistance or support to prop up the Assad regime, which is responsible for chemical weapon attacks in Syria.  Madam Speaker, I thank, again, Mr. Cole for bringing this amendment, and I encourage all of my colleagues to support it."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of my time to close.  Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to this rule and the underlying measure.  The majority has brought up a resolution under the War Powers Resolution instructing the President to remove the United States Armed Forces from hostilities in Yemen. Unfortunately, this resolution is misguided. United States Armed Forces are not currently involved in hostilities in Yemen, and it is unclear exactly what this resolution will accomplish.  Further, passage of this resolution would likely damage our relationships with our allies, who would have reason to question our commitments to them, and embolden our potential adversaries in the future.  I want to take just a moment to, frankly, reaffirm and thank my friend for his strong assertion of Congress' powers under war powers. I think he has absolutely been a leader in this area, and I have tried to work with him on many occasions.  I want to state for the Record, I look forward to working with him in this area again, because I think this body, under both Republicans and Democrats, has far too often abdicated its responsibilities and simply left it to the executive branch to determine when we were at war.  Frankly, when President Bush 41 went to war in the Gulf, he came to Congress and asked for its permission; when President Bush 43 went to war, he came to Congress and asked for its permission in both Afghanistan and Iraq--and they received it.  President Obama never bothered to do that. Whether it was in Libya or whether it was extending the mission, in many cases, he simply did not choose to do that. And, frankly, it was President Obama who began the actions that concerned my friends in Yemen.  So, again, my friend has appropriately tried to pursue, over the course of his career, the reassertion of congressional war powers, and I commend him for that. This case is not one of those cases.  The President of the United States does have legitimate powers as Commander in Chief to support friends and allies short of war without congressional approval. That has happened time and time and time again in American history.  We have 117 security agreements with various countries around the world. Some of those are with countries we have formal alliances with, some of them are not. They do not commit the United States to hostilities, but they do say, in certain situations, we will be there to render support.  I agree with my friend that there have been atrocities in Yemen. I think he is absolutely right about that. I think, unfortunately, we didn't talk very much about the Iranian role in that. We didn't talk very much about the Houthi role in that. We didn't talk very much about who overthrew a legitimate government and what other countries were involved in that. This is a lot more complex than that.  But, in this case, unlike Libya, for instance, where President Obama did commit us to military activity without coming to this Chamber and asking permission, somehow stretched the NATO alliance to cover our participation in a conflict within a country that had not attacked any member of NATO, let alone the United States of America, that was a time we should have done something like this.  Right now, in my view, whether you agree with him or not, the President is exercising his legitimate authority as Commander in Chief. And it is worth noting for the Record, he is actually doing less than his predecessor, President Obama, did. He actually is the person, President Trump, who ordered the cessation of aerial refueling operations with the Saudi Air Force.  Again, there is room for disagreement here. I know, on the underlying issue of congressional war powers, my friend and I agree. I look forward to working with him on that issue as we go forward, as I know we will. But, in my opinion, this is the wrong place and the wrong time to have this debate.  I think the President is operating well within his rights. He has made it clear he will veto this legislation should it pass the United States Senate. None of us know whether it will. But I can assure you this: that veto will have more than enough votes to sustain it.  So, again, I thank my friend for the spirited debate and discussion. It is always thoughtful.  Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the previous question, ``no'' on the underlying measure, and I yield back the balance of my time."

We may not agree on this specific bill, but we have worked together on matters like the Authorization for Use of Military Force for many years. He is always thoughtful in urging Congress to reclaim authority on matters of war and peace, and I do look forward to working with him in the months ahead.  Let me just remind my colleagues about how this bill came to the floor.  It was introduced in January. There was a hearing in the Foreign Affairs Committee. They held a markup, and the Rules Committee did a hearing and made amendments in order.  Some of my Republican friends may not agree with the underlying bill, but there shouldn't be much disagreement about the process, because this is how the process should work. We even made in order a Republican amendment from Congressman Buck that I strongly oppose. That amendment would allow the President to maintain unfettered intelligence sharing with any foreign country, even when the sole objective is to help determine which targets to bomb in offensive airstrikes not authorized by Congress.  I don't believe we should preemptively cede our own purview over intelligence sharing, and certainly not as part of a resolution designed to reassert Congress' constitutional war authority.  Maybe this amendment passes--I hope it doesn't--but it will be debated, voted upon, and this House will decide.  Let me say to my colleagues what is happening in Yemen is horrific. It should shake every Member of this institution to their core: bombings of weddings, funerals, and school buses; thousands dead; children starving--a humanitarian nightmare.  I don't know what is going to happen over in the Senate, but I know what this institution should do, and that is reclaim our responsibilities and make clear that the Constitution matters, that human rights matter; the lives of people in Yemen and the children in Yemen, they matter. This Chamber, under this majority, is going to provide a consequence for the actions of the Saudi Government. And I hope that this resolution is just our first step in responding to the humanitarian issues across the region. I look forward to the Foreign Affairs Committee holding more hearings and markups and bringing more bills to the Rules Committee.  I have introduced a bipartisan bill with 20 colleagues that will immediately stop all military aid and armed sales to the Government of Saudi Arabia. I think it is the right thing to do when our democratic values are on the line. I would like to see that come up for a vote, but I want to have a hearing and a markup before it comes to this floor.

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  This is an important moment for the House, Madam Chair. For years, under administrations of both parties, the Congress has handed away our authority and abrogated our responsibility when it comes to foreign policy, particularly the questions of how and where our military is engaged around the world.  Article I of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to declare war, yet we have given Presidents of both parties a virtual blank check to send our brave servicemembers into harm's way while we have stood on the sidelines.  With the measure we are considering today, we take some of that power back, and we do so to restore a sense of American values and American leadership to the worst humanitarian catastrophe in the world.  For the last few years, we have all seen horrific images of the civilian casualties in the Yemen war: starving children, millions displaced, outbreaks of deadly disease.  Madam Chair, 85,000 children have starved to death. Fourteen million are on the brink of famine. More than a million suffer from cholera. And the ongoing military operations are bringing us no closer to a resolution. The only way out of this mess is for parties to sit down and work toward a political solution.  The United States can and should play a role pushing for that solution, pushing parties to make a commitment to negotiations. This measure, introduced by Mr. Khanna, will help us do exactly that.  Let me explain why this is so important and why I support passing this resolution right now.  In the last few years, the Saudi-led coalition has carried out 18,000 airstrikes. A full one-third of those strikes hit nonmilitary targets. This is absolutely reckless.  I am not naive, Madam Chair. I know we have critical strategic interests in that region. The Houthis are a problem. They get support from Iran. They launch missiles into Saudi territory and international waterways, threatening Saudi civilians. They are starving the Yemeni people, diverting assistance, and holding civilians hostage to their political demands. But we cannot just give the coalition a blank check when so many innocent lives are being lost. And if the administration won't demand any sort of accountability from the Saudis and Emiratis, it is time for Congress to act.  I want to acknowledge my friend from Texas, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul. I believe that he also wants to see Congress reclaim our prerogatives on foreign policy, though I understand we have an honest difference of opinion on the approach we are dealing with today.  I am glad that we moved this measure through regular order, that we had a hearing with experts and a markup, and that the gentleman from Texas and I could make our cases before the Rules Committee. It allowed me to hear the arguments from all perspectives on this issue.  I think, during this debate, we will hear my friends on the other side call this resolution misguided. I think because this resolution has to do with our security agreements with the Saudis and Emiratis, we will hear them question what impact this may have on other security agreements.  It is a fair question, to be honest. That is why this measure is tailored so specifically to deal with just this situation. This is not a broad, blanket policy that is going to tie the hands of the executive branch. There is no dangerous precedent being set here, just an attempt to stop a war that is costing far too many innocent lives.  I think we will hear my friends question whether this measure would even do anything because this measure withdraws American forces engaged in hostilities, and the Pentagon says ``hostilities'' only applies to situations where American troops are firing weapons at an enemy. I have two reactions to that.  First of all, this measure would specifically define ``hostilities'' to include aerial refueling of warplanes carrying out airstrikes against Houthi militants. Now, I understand the Defense Department has stopped refueling as a matter of policy, but policies can be reversed, so this resolution would cut off refueling as a matter of law.  My second point is broader and gets at the heart of today's debate. This body is not subject to the definitions conjured up by the Defense Department. We don't ask permission to exercise our Article I authority. Of course, the Pentagon will try to define things in a way that consolidates the power of the executive branch, but Congress, with authority over war powers, need not accept that definition.  The Congress has lost its grip on foreign policy, in my opinion, by granting too much deference to the executive branch, by failing to examine the decisions, determinations, and definitions that are used to justify sending Americans into harm's way. Our job is to keep that branch in check, not to shrug our shoulders when they tell us to mind our own business.  Lastly, I think we will hear my colleagues on the other side ask: Isn't this just all politics? No, Madam Chair. Politics is what the former majority did to this resolution twice during the last Congress. Politics is stifling debate on national security issues because we are uncomfortable with the message it might send or we don't want to take a tough vote. Politics is walking away from our constitutional responsibilities, as Congress has done for far too long; and frankly, we have done it for far too long, Congresses in both parties with a majority and Presidents in both parties.  Our Article I responsibilities are things that we cannot just simply turn the other way. We are a coequal branch of government, and we have not had a declaration of war, for instance, since 1941. We are content to just tell whatever administration is in, go ahead, you handle it. We don't have any responsibility. I hope that that stops this afternoon.  The other body has already weighed in on this measure. It passed with bipartisan support. Today, the Members of the House get our chance to go on record finally and say where we stand.  I joined this resolution as an original cosponsor because I think it will lead to a sort of reckoning for our government.  What is our role in the conflict in Yemen?  What is Congress' voice in our foreign policy?  How will we exercise American leadership and American power?  What will we provide and what will we withhold to push warring parties toward peace?  I want to thank Mr. Khanna for his hard work and for his leadership in shining the light on this issue.  I want to thank our members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee who have contributed so far to a valuable debate.  I want to thank Mr. McCaul, who has made his opposition to this about the policy, not about the politics or the personalities. We are going to have a lot more debates; sometimes we will be on the same side and sometimes not, but I hope we can always grapple with these challenges in a substantive way.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Let me just begin by extending my appreciation for the chairman. I know his arguments are well-intentioned, as are mine. I believe that we both completely agree and completely support Congress' solemn duty under Article I of the Constitution, to authorize the commitment of U.S. troops to foreign hostilities; and perhaps there will be another example where we can join forces in that. But that is not the issue here.  Allow me to quote the actual War Powers Act, from Title 50 of the United States Code. This procedure applies to ``the removal of United States Armed Forces engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States.''  This has always meant, historically, and today, U.S. troops being directly involved in live-fire combat. As the Department of Defense has repeatedly confirmed, U.S. Armed Forces are not engaged in hostilities against the Houthi forces in Yemen.  This resolution is directing us to remove troops that simply, Madam Chair, are not there. Even the aerial refueling of coalition jets, which does not constitute traditional hostilities, ended last November.  This resolution, in my judgment, misuses the tool to try to get at the different issue of security assistance to third countries. It provides no clear decisions on which forms of assistance are cut off. It does not address the humanitarian catastrophe inside Yemen and, alarmingly, it completely ignores the destabilization role that Iran is playing in Yemen and the region.  This irresponsible measure is trying to hammer a square peg in a round hole.  This resolution really stretches the definition of ``hostilities'' to cover non-U.S. military operations by other countries. It reinterprets U.S. support to those countries as ``engagement in hostilities.''  This overreach has dangerous implications far beyond Saudi Arabia. This approach will now allow any single Member to use this privileged mechanism to second-guess U.S. security cooperation relationships with more than 100 countries throughout the world.  Under this model, if one Member doesn't like something that any of our security partners does overseas, that Member can force quick consideration of a resolution directing the removal of U.S. forces from hostilities ``in or affecting'' that situation. It no longer matters that U.S. forces are not actually conducting those hostilities.  This could impact our assistance to Israel. It could affect our cooperation with our NATO allies. It could impact counterterrorism cooperation with African nations in the Sahel. We could recklessly undo critical security relationships that we have spent decades building.  That is not what the War Powers Resolution has ever meant, and I don't think that is what Congress designed it to do, and it should not be used in this way now.  No one is saying that U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, or anyone else, is beyond congressional scrutiny. Congress has many tools at its disposal. Our committee receives regular arms sales notifications. Congress can condition or cut off security assistance through targeted legislation or the annual appropriations process.  But this resolution is the wrong tool. It is vague and irresponsible. It will create new doubts for our partners and allies around the world.  For those reasons, Madam Chair, I strongly oppose this measure, and I reserve the balance of my time."

This is not a complex issue. For the last 2 years, we have been assisting the Saudis in bombing Yemeni civilians; and the reports say there are 14 million Yemenis who face starvation; 14 million.  Let's put that in context: 800,000 people died in Rwanda; 100,000 in Bosnia, and 14 million face famine in Yemen. And it is not because the world doesn't have enough food or medicine to get in there. It is because there is a systematic bombing preventing the food and medicine to get in.  We want to send the food. We want to send medicine, but the Saudis aren't allowing that food and medicine to get in.  And what do we know about Saudi Arabia? We know that they were responsible for the murder of Khashoggi. We know recently, that MBS admitted that he wanted Khashoggi dead.  We know that they, the Saudis, are supplying arms to al-Qaida in Yemen who are fighting our troops. The Saudis are giving arms to the very people who are fighting our troops. This is why Senator Lindsey Graham has said he may support this resolution.

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Chair, this resolution is misguided, and let me take a few moments to illustrate some of the reasons.  Number 1, as the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. McCaul, has described, this is a misuse of the War Powers Resolution. It conflates two different sections. It has definitional problems. I am not going to repeat all the arguments he has used.  My point is that, if we use that powerful law, it should be clear, direct, and applicable. To misuse it in this way actually weakens the authority of Congress, the exact opposite of what the chairman of the committee was talking about.  Secondly, the message coming from this resolution is, Iran, you can do whatever you want to.  Now, it is clear we do not have troops in the fight against the Houthis. We do, however, want other countries to join in trying to constrain Iran's aggression in various parts of the world. But with this resolution, we are saying, Okay, you are on your own. We are not going to assist you in any way. And that message reverberates throughout the Middle East. It will have lasting consequences.  Third, if anything, this resolution will make our military more cautious when targeting ISIS and al-Qaida.  Now there is a section in here that says, Well, it doesn't really apply when you are going against terrorists. But Yemen is a messy place. You have individuals commingled in the same location. Sometimes the same individual can have multiple loyalties.  Our military will be overly cautious in interpreting this resolution. They will be less likely to target ISIS and al-Qaida.  Mr. Chairman, don't forget. It wasn't very long ago the most serious threats coming to our homeland, to Americans emanated from Yemen. This adds danger to the world.  Fourth, I think this resolution makes a humanitarian situation worse. As long as rockets are fired from Yemen into Riyadh, there will be a military response.  Now, the U.S. has been assisting the Saudis in targeting, so that it is narrower; so that they are only targeting military targets and minimizing civilian casualties. And yet, this resolution says, No, you can't offer that sort of help.  So what is the result? It is going to, unfortunately, be less specific targeting, and I am afraid that the humanitarian situation will only grow worse.  Fifth, and finally, if this passes and signs into law, it will not help the people of Yemen one iota. There are lots of things we just heard from the author of the resolution, why he does not approve of some of the actions going on with Saudi Arabia. This does not help any of that.  It is an attempt to make us feel better, that we have at least done something. And yet, the result is, we reduce our influence in the Middle East; we encourage and enhance the position of Iran; and we lead to a more dangerous world for us. That is quite an afternoon's work."

This joint resolution would direct the removal of U.S. forces from supporting the Saudi and Emirati that campaign in Yemen. We will still be supporting our fight against ISIS and al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula, which Congress has specifically authorized. We are not debating that.  We are also not debating, as some might suggest, setting a precedent when it comes to cooperating with our allies. This is about hostilities we are engaged in because we are supporting a coalition in war.  We have not authorized our military to act in the Yemeni civil war. This is about reclaiming the jurisdiction of Congress in making a war. That is our job. That is what we were elected to do. I would say that if there were a Democrat or a Republican in the White House.  Now, if the administration wants to be involved there, they need to come to Congress and make a compelling case.

Actually, the U.S. is not directly engaged in any hostilities in Yemen. This is not my independent assessment, but the determination of the Department of Defense.  The U.S. is currently supporting the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen by providing targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and joint planning to defeat the Houthi rebels who are armed by Iran, with missiles that they have directed at civilian airports in Saudi Arabia.  There is no doubt that the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen has made terrible targeting mistakes. But what would happen if the U.S. were to pull the plug on our intelligence-sharing and targeting cooperation?  Would this improve the coalition's targeting or possibly make it worse, increasing the chances for collateral damage and civilian casualties?  I am concerned that, if we walk away now, these terrible tragedies will simply multiply.  The United States must be at the table so that we can insist on and respect international law. This does not mean that the coalition will always do the right thing, but it does mean that we will have leverage and influence to promote the right direction.  Instead of this resolution, I hope that our colleagues, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel and Ranking Member, Republican leader,   Mike McCaul, will work together on a bipartisan initiative that can address these important concerns in Yemen.  We can all agree that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen must be addressed and that the ongoing conflict must come to an end.

The Foreign Affairs Committee has a proud tradition of bipartisanship, but that was thrown out the window with this bill.  Among my objections to this bill is the basic premise of the bill, which is flawed. U.S. Forces are not engaged in hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthi forces in Yemen.  This bill distorts the definition of hostilities to cover non-U.S. military operations by third countries. It then reinterprets U.S. activities in support of those countries as U.S. engagement in those hostilities.  I have been well documented throughout my time in Congress as opposing the misuse of the War Powers Act. That is really what needs to be addressed: the misapplication of the 2001 and 2002 AUMFs.  While I wholeheartedly believe that the U.S. Forces put into combat roles must be approved by Congress, I cannot stand by as those firm beliefs in the Constitution are twisted around to make a political messaging point.  Keep in mind, my colleagues from the other side talk about the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, yet they fail to mention the Houthi rebel fighters overthrew the legitimate government of President Hadi, and this overthrow was sponsored by Iran, which Iran is the largest sponsor of state terrorism. That is really where the problem is in this. We are there in a different capacity.  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues not to vote for this partisan bill because, if we break this agreement, we have got over 100 other agreements that we would have to negotiate with our allies, and this would be bad for America's foreign policy.

After the Republican leader declined to allow this resolution to come to the floor in December, I promised to bring it to the floor.  Here we are, and now the House will have an opportunity to express its views to the President and to the country that he ought to end his administration's support of the Saudi coalition's military campaign in Yemen. It is a campaign that has led to tremendous human suffering, with minimal military gains. After 4 years, it is time for a change in policy.  Let me be clear: The Houthi rebels in Yemen are bad actors, engaging in brutal actions against civilians, and they are sponsored by Iran. The Houthis commit human rights abuses, prevent humanitarian assistance to starving civilians, and exercise a brute form of governance in the areas they control. We should have no illusion that there are two parties responsible for this humanitarian catastrophe; however, we are supporting one of them.  The result of the coalition campaign thus far has been an unmitigated humanitarian disaster as well as a military stalemate.  Using military force to pressure the Houthi rebels into accepting coalition demands has demonstrably not worked. It is time, therefore, for Congress to make clear to the Trump administration and to our country and to the international community that it cannot simply keep our Yemen policy on autopilot while the situation not only has not improved, but deteriorates.  With the United States supporting one party to this conflict, the best way we promote a peaceful and positive solution is by focusing our efforts on the variables that we can affect. It is time that we set a new course forward on Yemen and that the House and Senate need to demand that the administration uphold basic American values in its exercise of our foreign policy. That means ending our support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen.  Although not the focus of this resolution, I am mindful that this debate is taking place a day after the President disregarded the law and failed to report to Congress who was responsible for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The more the President tries to sweep this heinous incident under the rug, the more incumbent upon Congress it is to act.  This resolution is bipartisan. A similar resolution passed the United States Senate. It was not brought to this floor. I hope it will receive the strong support of both sides of the aisle.

In order to force a privileged measure in the Senate, my colleagues had to expand and distort the definitions in the War Powers Resolution to achieve their goals. This is absolutely poor policy, and we cannot support such a measure.  The misuse of this privileged tool endangers U.S. security cooperation with over 100 partners around the world, to include Israel, NATO, and many antiterror allies.

I previously served in Active Duty in the military. It was clear to me that what the Saudi jets were doing in dropping bombs on innocent civilians was a war crime.  In 2016, I introduced legislation to limit the transfer of air-to-ground munitions from the U.S. to Saudi Arabia. And then, working with other Members such as Representatives Pocan and Welch and others, we were able to cause the Obama administration to stop a shipment of air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia.  In 2017, I worked with Representative Ted Yoho, and we helped insert language into the NDAA requesting the administration to certify what the heck it was doing in Yemen.

Res. 37, directing the removal of U.S. Armed Forces from unauthorized hostilities in Yemen. One of the reasons why is because we aren't even engaged in hostilities in Yemen. The United States is not involved in any direct live fire exchanges. Last November, the U.S. stopped aerial refueling of Saudi jets.  According to the Department of Defense, U.S. support to the coalition is for defensive purposes only. It focuses only on helping minimize civilian casualties, which means that this resolution, if passed and implemented, will actually result in less food and medicine getting into Yemen and more civilians dying, and the war will not end.  If anyone wants to propose a bill and pass one cutting off or conditioning specified U.S. security assistance to Saudi Arabia, they have the ability to do so. That is not this bill.  What is also important is that there are a lot of freshman Members here in this Chamber, and the fact that we are rushing this to the floor so quickly without having a classified briefing for all of those Members is also deeply unfortunate. That should take place before passing this resolution.  Congress has many other ways to engage in oversight efforts for U.S. security assistance with Saudi Arabia, including approving arms sales and through appropriations.  Our assistance for Saudi Arabia started in 2015, when the Houthis overthrew a legitimate government, backed by Iran. The Houthis fired missiles against Saudi Arabia with support from Iran, and the U.S. provided intelligence and logistical support in compliance with the law of armed conflict.  Iran poses a massive geostrategic threat to Yemen and to the United States and many of our allies. Iran is providing training and support to the Houthi rebels, including supplying ballistic missiles that have been fired into Saudi Arabia. In 2016, missiles were fired by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels at a U.S. Navy warship near the Bab el-Mandeb. If Iran has the ability to cut off global shipping through the Strait of Hormuz and el-Mandeb, it would have disastrous consequences.

For 4 years, we have aided the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen, which has contributed to the gravest humanitarian crisis in the world, a man-made crisis that we could help alleviate, rather than contribute to. This is 4 years too long.  The Trump administration has cozied up to the Saudis, ignoring the harm they cause in Yemen and their egregious violations of human rights. The President has expressed his personal affirmation for the Saudi Kingdom on several occasions, saying, ``They give us a lot of business,'' and, ``They've been a great ally to me.''  Trump and those opposed to this resolution have argued that our ties to Saudi Arabia are too precious and that our cooperation on counterterrorism and countering Iran would be jeopardized by this resolution. But in December, when discussing an earlier version of this resolution, Senator Lindsey Graham wrote the following: ``The fear that the Saudis will stop cooperating with the U.S. on terrorism or Iran isn't rational. Those threats pose as much of a danger to the Saudis as they do to America. Demanding better from allies isn't downgrading the relationship; it's a sign that Americans take our principles seriously and won't be taken advantage of by anyone, friend or foe.''  Mr. Chairman, I urge Congress to reassert its constitutional authority to work to end the suffering of millions and to pass this war powers resolution. This is what it is."

Passing it would pose a threat to many other important bilateral agreements that help keep us and our allies safe and make the world a better place.  Even the resolution is misleading. Our Armed Forces are not engaged in hostilities in the Yemen conflict. Outside of Yemen, the U.S. Armed Forces support an ally, through intelligence sharing, threat analysis, and logistical support.  The strength of our international relations lies on the numerous global relationships that we hold. We help each other understand, forecast, and eliminate threats. This is especially true in the Arabian Peninsula, where ISIS and al-Qaida have been notoriously active.  Furthermore, pertinent facts relating to Yemen are classified, leaving Congressmen and -women to vote blind.  Mr. Chairman, we have a long history of free-thinking bipartisanship when it comes to foreign policy. I ask my colleagues to think for themselves, not merely vote along party lines."

Congress must put down a marker stating it is unacceptable for our military to support hostilities we have not authorized.  Our support for the Saudi-led coalition's efforts in Yemen has proven problematic in so many ways. The impact on civilian lives is real and painful. Overall, 60,000 lives have been lost.  Ultimately, the question should be really simple: Did Congress authorize our military to engage in hostilities in Yemen? The answer is no.

I would add nor do they fight or participate in undeclared wars.  The United States is not participating in the Yemen war in the sense that many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have characterized. In fact, I personally asked Secretary Mattis on two occasions to help draft authorization against Iranian proxies.  This is, at best, a half measure in that it stops any active participation in undeclared unauthorized combat. But it also fails to advance the policy of our country, which is to treat Iran as the threat it is, not just to the United States of America, but to its neighbors and our allies in the region."

Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 37, directing the President to remove U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting Yemen within 30 days.  Since 2015, the United States has provided support to the Saudi-led coalition in its war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen.  In addition to claiming an estimated 60,000 Yemeni lives, this war is fueling the world's largest humanitarian and refugee crisis. Humanitarian agencies estimate that 85,000 children have died from malnutrition, more than half the population currently requires emergency food assistance, and 1 in every 10 Yemeni children has been forcibly displaced from their homes due to the conflict.  In September of 2018, Secretary Pompeo certified to Congress that the Saudi and Emirati Governments were mitigating harm to civilians and civilian infrastructure in Yemen. Meanwhile, the Saudi-led coalition conducted attacks killing dozens of civilians at a time, often with U.S.-provided munitions.  Article I, Section 8, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution states unequivocally that Congress shall have the power to declare war and to raise and support armies and other Armed Forces. That is Congress' prerogative in the Constitution.  Pursuant to the War Powers Resolution, the President must remove U.S. Armed Forces engaged in hostilities outside U.S. territory without a specific statutory authorization from Congress.  Congress must reclaim its constitutional role, and American complicity in the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Yemen must end. That is why I am glad to support H.J. Res. 37, which would direct such a removal of U.S. Armed Forces from hostilities associated with the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen.  Importantly, this legislation defines hostilities to include in-flight fueling of non-U.S. aircraft conducting counter-Houthi missions.  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this resolution."

The problem here is that President Trump has essentially subcontracted out American foreign policy in the Middle East to a murderous Saudi regime, and the result has been that 85,000 little children under the age of five have been starved to death or have died of disease as a result of Saudi blockades and aggression. Indifference to their suffering is dooming a generation--unlawful, murderous airstrikes with bombs made in America on schools, on hospitals, on weddings, on markets.  All these people who speak out about the security of Israel and of America, they seem to have forgotten that these same Saudis have been giving away American-made weapons to al-Qaida--al-Qaida--once the sworn enemy of the Houthis about whom they complain.  The Saudi leadership, which approved the killing and dismemberment of an American resident journalist, is unsurprisingly not moved by the suffering of these children. They are intent on annihilation of the Yemenis.  We cannot let the slaughter continue in the name of American taxpayers. The Saudis do not represent our values, but they are using our tax dollars and our weapons.  Instead of shutting down our government, President Trump needs to shut down cooperation with the regime that tortures women who speak out, that kills its enemies who dare to speak the truth, and that is waging an immoral conflict, the world's largest humanitarian catastrophe.

Mr. Chair, we have a proud tradition in this country that both sides want to honor, and that is to stand up for freedom and for human decency and dignity.

                "speech":"Mr. Chair, I have no further speakers, so I am prepared to close, and I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chair, let me state a few points.  We all condemn the murder of Khashoggi. I have condemned it publicly, very strongly, what happened with the Saudis killing Khashoggi, executing him.  We are talking about the situation in Yemen.  Who started this humanitarian crisis in the first place? The Houthis tried to take over the Yemeni Government--the Houthis, backed by Iran.  This is about the geopolitics of Iran, Houthis in Yemen, Iran and the Shia crescent in Iraq and Syria, and a direct threat to Israel by the largest state-sponsored terror, Iran, that is a mortal sworn enemy to Israel, as they chant ``death to Israel,'' ``death to America.''  So let's put this all in proper context of what we are really talking about here. Are we defending Iran and the Houthis here today?  So I would like to close by putting two documents in the Record. The first is a letter sent by the Department of Defense Office of General Counsel stating that ``DOD opposes the resolution because the resolution's fundamental premise is flawed'' because the United States support to the Saudi-led coalition ``does not involve any introduction of U.S. forces into hostilities.''  Are we going to go around and second-guess every security cooperation agreement we have with 117 countries, including Israel and NATO and other partners?  Mr. Chair, I include in the Record this letter from the General Counsel of the Department of Defense. Mr. Chair, I include in the Record this second document, which is a Statement of Administration Policy on this point. Mr. Chair, I am deeply troubled by the one-sided nature of this resolution and what is missing from this resolution, which I just stated earlier, and that is Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terror and the Houthis' benefactor. By staying silent on Iran and by not condemning the Houthis in this resolution, it sends a green light to the Houthis and to the Iranian backers to press on.  This resolution is counterproductive, also, to the efforts that are ongoing right now to negotiate peace in Yemen between the Houthi rebels and the Government of the Yemen Republic.  As we speak, the U.N. envoy is working with the full support of the United States to negotiate a political resolution to this conflict. Getting to these talks has required placing substantial pressure on all parties involved.  The U.N. is encouraging the Houthis to uphold these agreements and to make further agreements with the Yemini Government and the Saudi-led coalition. But this resolution might cut the U.N. efforts off at its knees.  The Democrats can't tell specifically what assistance this resolution cuts off, but what I can say for sure is that what this resolution says to the Houthis and to Iran is: You have got a green light. Keep going on. You can gain more ground and cause more destruction and humanitarian crisis and cause more problems for Israel and our Saudi ally.  Advancing this pro-Houthi, pro-Iran, anti-Israel resolution does not help to end this war. In Yemen, it only emboldens the rebels in Iran who violently overthrew Yemen's Government and the radical regime that backs them, Iran.  So I would say, Mr. Chairman, in closing, this resolution is not only a dangerous precedent legally--it violates the construction of the War Powers Act--but it is damaging and very bad policy, and I urge my colleagues to vote against it.  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Today is the day that Congress begins to take back its jurisdiction over war and peace. For time after time and year after year, administration after administration, Congress after Congress, the Congress has relinquished its responsibility given to us by the Constitution.  The Constitution clearly says that Congress has the power to wage war, and yet, since President Roosevelt declared war against Japan on December 7, 1941, we have had war after war and conflict after conflict, and Congress has not had anything to do with it. Congress has been silent.  This is not a matter of whether a war is a good war or a bad war. This is a matter of the fact that this Congress needs to make that determination.  Article I makes us a coequal branch of government. And, again, for too long, we have had administration after administration, Republican and Democratic, usurp the power that should be the Congress'. So this is the day my colleagues would begin to take it back.  Mr. Chair, I know that my friends on the other side of the aisle have been saying that this is not the best way to do it, but, you know, I have learned through the years that, if you don't take the bull by the horns, it is never the best way to do it.  There is always a reason not to do it. There is always a reason to point out certain things and say, well, this is not a perfect situation. This isn't the perfect situation. I will be the first to say that. But it is perfect in terms of saying we will take back our jurisdiction and do what the American people elected us to do.  Again, I want to thank Mr. Khanna for his tireless work on this issue.  As I mentioned, this measure is an important step in Congress reclaiming its role in foreign policy by debating where and when the United States military is engaged abroad. I don't think that is too much to ask. I think that is what we should be doing.  With the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, it is critical that we act now. We can go after Iran another time--and heaven knows I have been the sponsor of many resolutions and bills sanctioning Iran--but this is not to mix apples with oranges.  There is a civil war going on now in Yemen, and innocent children are dying. We have an ability to put an end to that, and that is what we should do. With this humanitarian crisis, it is critical that we don't delay.  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.J. Res. 37, which would end U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and will soon enter its 4th year.  The humanitarian situation in Yemen is grave and deteriorating. Since the conflict began in 2015 between the Saudi-led military coalition and the Houthi militias, Yemen has faced what is widely recognized as the worst humanitarian crisis in the world.  The conflict has displaced millions of Yemenis, shattered the country, and triggered a famine that has 13 million men, women and children facing starvation.  Additionally, the country is facing an outbreak of cholera of unprecedented scale, with over a million cases of this disease because of the destruction of Yemen's water and sanitation infrastructure.  The United States has provided weapons, targeting assistance and refueling support to the Saudi-led coalition since the conflict began. However, this support was never authorized by Congress and is not covered by any existing Authorization for the Use of Military Force.  In addition, the coalition's bombing campaign has caused significant numbers of civilian casualties, and the conflict continues with no end in sight.  My district is home to a large Yemeni-American community, and I constantly hear stories of the suffering caused by the Yemen conflict and the dire humanitarian situation on the ground.  The breadth and magnitude of the humanitarian crisis is almost unimaginable, and we must take action to address this without delay.  This begins with ending our nation's involvement in the Yemen war. U.S. involvement in the Yemen conflict has undermined our nation's moral authority and has never been authorized by Congress.  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important resolution, which will send a strong signal that this Congress will not stand idly by in the face of such actions.  H.J. Res. 37 will help bring an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people and reassert Congress's authority as a coequal branch of government. It is my hope that passage of this resolution will be the first step toward healing Yemen and ending this brutal and senseless conflict."

                "speech":"Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 37, which directs the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities in the Republic of Yemen that have not been authorized by Congress.  The passage of H.J. Res. 37 would mark the first time in the 45 years since the enactment of the War Powers Act that the House of Representatives successfully invoked the statute's removal mechanism to compel the Executive Branch to remove American troops from harm's way.  I support this resolution because, Congress has the sole power to declare war under Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the United States Constitution.  Mr. Chair, Congress has not declared war with respect to, or provided a specific statutory authorization for, the conflict between military forces led by Saudi Arabia, including forces from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Senegal, and Sudan (the Saudi-led coalition), against the Houthis, also known as Ansar Allah, in the Republic of Yemen.  Since March 2015, members of the United States Armed Forces have been introduced into hostilities between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis, including providing to the Saudi-led coalition aerial targeting assistance, intelligence sharing, and mid-flight aerial refueling.  The United States has established a Joint Combined Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia, in which members of the United States Armed Forces assist in aerial targeting and help to coordinate military and intelligence activities.  Mr. Chair, the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis constitutes, within the meaning of Section 4(a) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1543(a)), either hostilities or a situation where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances into which United States Armed Forces have been introduced.  Section 5(c) of the War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1544(c)) states that, ``at any time that United States Armed Forces are engaged in hostilities outside the territory of the United States, its possessions and territories without a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization, such forces shall be removed by the President if the Congress so directs''.  Most importantly, no specific statutory authorization for the use of United States Armed Forces with respect to the conflict between the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis in Yemen has been enacted.  Also, no provision of law explicitly authorizes the provision of targeting assistance or of midair refueling services to warplanes of Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates that are engaged in such conflict.  For this reason, the resolution directs that the President remove United States Armed Forces from hostilities in or affecting the Republic of Yemen, except United States Armed Forces engaged in operations directed at al-Qaeda or associated forces, by not later than the date that is 30 days after the date of the enactment.  The resolution makes clear that the term ``hostilities'' includes in-flight refueling, non-United States aircraft conducting missions as part of the ongoing civil war in Yemen.  Mr. Chair, Yemen is the largest humanitarian crisis in the world right now.  The Yemen crisis began in the Arab Spring of 2011, when an uprising forced the country's long-time authoritarian president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, to hand over power to his deputy, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.  Since 2015, Saudis Arabia has launched an estimated 18,000 air strikes on Yemen, attacking hospitals, schools, water treatment plants, funerals, markets and even farms.  The Saudis also imposed a blockade on food, fuel and medicine from freely entering the country in what can only be described as a deliberate effort to starve the civilian population into submission.  More than 14 million Yemenis are steps away from starvation and at least 85,000 children under the age of five have perished from war-related hunger and disease.  The United States has supported the Saudi-led air campaign with mid-air refueling support, intelligence and targeting assistance, and other support.  Yemen is experiencing the world's worst famine in 100 years, with 12 million to 13 million innocent civilians at risk of dying from the lack of food within months.  Mr. Chair, too many lives hang in the balance to allow American involvement in Yemen war to continue.  I ask all members to join me in supporting H.J. Res. 37"

This amendment that I have offered does just that.  I actually thought of this amendment after the chairman of the committee held a hearing on this issue, and I listened carefully to the witnesses. The witnesses talked about the fact that our intelligence sharing with Saudi Arabia helped target sites in Yemen to bomb and reduced civilian casualties.

If adopted, the resolution will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.  Mr. Speaker, the attack in October last year against the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh was a devastating assault on the Jewish community. By inflicting violence on a neighborhood congregation's Shabbat morning service, the gunman sent a bone-chilling message; even in 2018, hate-filled individuals will attack Jews simply for being Jewish.  The Anti-Defamation League believes that this is the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United States of America. This tragedy is merely one part of an upsetting development that has emerged in recent years, a resurgence of anti-Semitism around the globe.  The Anti-Defamation League reported a 60 percent rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States from 2016 to 2017.  In December, the European Union released a survey of over 16,000 European Jews, which reported that ``anti-Semitism pervades everyday life,'' undermining European Jews' feelings of safety and security.  Mr. Speaker, we should all be alarmed by this international trend. No one should be forced to live in fear of violence, or be deterred from participating in their faith community.  The United States must remain a global leader, not only in speaking out against anti-Semitism, but in holding those who enable these vile beliefs accountable.  Our motion to recommit adds language to H.J. Res. 37 that affirms that it is in the national security interest of the United States to combat anti-Semitism around the world. It states that we must make combating anti-Semitism a priority in all of our diplomatic relationships; and we need to ensure that Jews around the world feel safe in their communities.  Mr. Speaker, I remain deeply concerned by the measure the Democrats have called up today on Yemen, but if this resolution is going to move forward, it should do so while making a strong statement that the United States has no tolerance for anti-Semitism.  I urge all Members to stand in solidarity with Jews around the world and support the motion to recommit.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

Walter died on February 10, his 76th birthday. He lived a life full of service: 4 years in the North Carolina National Guard, 10 years in the North Carolina General Assembly, and nearly a quarter century in the U.S. House of Representatives.  Walter and I met long before either of us served in the House. We worked together on the North Carolina Presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter in 1976. I have a photo on my desk of a very youthful-looking campaign team to prove it.  Walter went on to chart a different course politically, a course that was uniquely his own. In fact, he found himself frequently at odds with if not one party, then the other. But by the same token, he sometimes found possibilities for alliances and cooperation in unexpected places and did not hesitate to take those opportunities.  This approach was rooted in Walter's strong conscience and his personal sincerity. He stood out in an age when sincerity is sometimes in short supply in our Nation's politics, earning him respect and admiration on both sides of the aisle. The outpouring of tributes and remembrances we have seen in recent days is a testament to that fact.  Much has been said about the personal encounters Walter had with veterans of the Iraq war and the families of those who never returned, and how these encounters led him to reassess his past and present policy stances.  Walter sent over 10,000 letters to families of fallen troops, and he memorialized those who died from North Carolina's Camp Lejeune with photos outside his office.  Walter's determined and effective voice for our military--certainly, the Marines especially--and his deep love for his home State of North Carolina will be missed in these halls and in the coastal, farming, and military communities that make up the Third Congressional District.  We extend heartfelt condolences to Walter's wife, Joe Anne; his daughter, Ashley; his loyal staff; and the countless friends, neighbors, and community members whose lives he touched along the way. Our State, our Nation, and the institution of Congress will be poorer without him.  We will miss Walter's reliable and cordial presence right here in this center aisle.  Mr. Speaker, before we observe a moment of silence in Walter's honor, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the senior Republican in the North Carolina delegation."

He frequently quoted a statement by Senator John Ashcroft's father: ``Washington is the spirit of arrogance, and Christ is the spirit of humility.'' Walter had the spirit of Christ.  It didn't matter if you were a waiter at his table, a summer intern in his office, or the chairman of his committee, Walter extended the same respect to everyone. In his heart, he never believed that he was any better than the most common person.  Walter's chief, Josh, who has been with him for 16 years, reminded me that some people in Washington, DC, kiss up and punch down. Walter often did the opposite. Walter would kiss down and punch up. He was a statesman and a true southern gentleman who followed his heart while fighting for his constituents.  Whether you agreed with him or not, Walter displayed the type of courage we could all hope to possess. He was willing to admit when he was wrong, like that time he devoted to Jimmy Carter. He would admit it in front of God, his colleagues, and his 750,000 constituents. That is true courage.  Walter's conscience guided his every vote and action in the 6 years that I knew him.  11,266: that is the final number of letters that Walter Jones personally wrote, offering his apologies and condolences to the families of soldiers who lost their lives in the wars in the Middle East. You see, Walter eagerly voted for the Iraq war, but then later came to believe that he had made a grave mistake.  Did he write those letters to prepare him for his next reelection? No. He wrote those letters to prepare him for this day, when he would be judged at the gates of Heaven.  What might seem like a small plight could become Walter's greatest cause, if honor and respect were in the balance. Whenever Walter gave the blessing before the meals that I shared with him, he would mention two marine pilots who had been unfairly implicated in a tragic crash. Clearing the names of Major Brooks Gruber and Lieutenant Colonel John Brow was one of his most important achievements. When I spoke with Walter 2 weeks ago, he said he looked forward to meeting them in Heaven. He was at peace.  Walter told me something else in that hour that we shared a couple of weeks ago. He reminded me that his father had served 13 terms in Congress, and it had been Walter's goal, he said, to match his father's service. For those who don't know, this was Walter's 13th term.  I told Walter, ``They never beat you, did they?'' Well, I used another word than that. He laughed. You see, all the money in the world was no match for Walter's sincerity, which always shone through to the people he served, even if they didn't always agree with him.  Walter wanted to finish this term, but God called him back too soon. I told Walter he would finish this term because when I would vote, I would ask myself: What would Walter do? He seemed pleased at that.  So please join me. The next time you are torn on what to do or say in this body, ask yourself: What would Walter do? Walter would follow his conscience. Just follow your conscience, and together, we can ensure that Walter's spirit finishes this 13th term."

More importantly, I am confident that the vast majority of the American people would agree that a child born alive is, in fact, alive.

I urge Members from both parties to see the born-alive bill as an opportunity to foster bipartisanship in this House.

As Governor Ralph Northam put it: ``The infant would be kept comfortable . . . and then a discussion would ensue.''  I think this is sickening. That is why my colleagues and I have called for the House vote on H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a commonsense bill to require that medical care--just medical care--be provided to children who survive a failed abortion.  Sadly, Democratic leadership in the House is standing in the way and refusing even to allow an up-or-down vote on this issue. This is not a partisan issue. It is simply what is right.

In mid-2013 my husband, Dan, and I went in for our 20-week ultrasound as excited first-time parents. We were not prepared for what we were told. We were told our unborn baby had a zero percent chance at survival. There were no kidneys. It was a condition called bilateral renal agenesis, or Potter's syndrome. As a result, our baby would either miscarry or be born unable to breathe because her lungs wouldn't develop. She would literally suffocate upon arrival if we brought her to term.  I, of course, was encouraged from physicians to abort my baby. While there are many reasons that lead women to make that decision, Dr. Jennifer Gunter, who is a women's health advocate, asserts that ``terminations after 24 weeks are for severe fetal anomalies.''  Now, our baby's diagnosis wasn't just severe; it was without any glimmer of hope. Being told that that wriggling, alive, kicking child in your stomach will certainly die doesn't just take the breath out of your lungs, it is like hell screaming in your face, and it leads to fear.  Miraculously, our doctors were wrong. We pushed forward with that pregnancy and were successful. We had seen something that had never happened before: my baby developed lungs in utero without kidneys. It was an impossible outcome to the medical world at that time.  In good faith, our doctors had given us their honest, professional opinions. But guess what. Doctors aren't infallible.  While we wouldn't have known this if we hadn't tried to overcome this diagnosis--and through divine intervention and some amazing doctors who were willing to charter new waters, literally--we now get to experience our daughter, Abigail, who is holding the Bible for the swearing-in standing next to me and Speaker Pelosi, a healthy, happy 5-year-old who is a big sister. She says that some day she is going to be the boss of Mommy's work.  Look out, Speaker Pelosi.  So since our story became public, I have talked to moms all over the world who, like me, carried their babies into the second and third trimesters hoping to deliver and then are given devastating diagnoses. But what if the doctor is wrong about their babies, too?  Abigail was the first to survive her condition, but because of her breakthrough, she is not the only survivor now.  Radical legislation in New York and Virginia has recently brought late-term or partial-birth abortion into the spotlight. But what if we used this discussion to go on the offensive against the potential disease instead of attacking the pregnancy itself?  Some parents have been presented with scary prenatal tests that can produce false alarms. These same earnest, loving, would-be parents have made permanent decisions based on what could be incorrect information.  What if the baby won't have that significant health condition or disability after all? Or even if she does, what about the loving families eager to raise a child in anticipation of her living a full and fulfilling life?  We got to hear Frank Stephens, an exceptionally joy-filled disability champion with Down syndrome, describe, at a congressional hearing, how he is a medical gift to society in that his extra chromosome might lead to the answer to Alzheimer's. Science bears this out.  Our society celebrates the term, ``diversity.'' Shouldn't that mean full diversity, which includes all physical and mental abilities, or disabilities as some call it?  We step onto very shaky ground when we start deciding who lives or dies based on one's abilities or, possibly, lack thereof in utero because, despite our best intentions or the best intentions of the messenger--doctor or otherwise--there is a limit to what science can predict.  That is not naivete speaking. That is coming from the mom of a child who was given a zero percent chance of survival based on, at the time, sound science.  Now this kiddo has a full, adult life ahead of her, and those of us who know her are privileged, immeasurably.  Do you know what? Every single child, regardless of their ability, has that same potential if we only give them that chance.  I believe that care, understanding, and compassion are needed at every stage of a woman's maternal journey. But to me, that means empowering mothers to dwell in the realm of the possible, not the impossible, even if it has never been tried before. "

In other words, the same conditions that would justify the killing of a baby in utero justifies the killing of that baby even when she is born.

A couple weeks ago, New York Governor Cuomo signed into law a bill to allow abortion until birth and even removes penalties for infanticide. Other States, including Virginia, Rhode Island, and New Mexico, have similar anti-child statutes under consideration.  The violent assault on children, Mr. Speaker, must end. Not only have 61 million unborn babies been killed since 1973 by either dismemberment--when a child is torn apart, arms, legs, and torso, literally dismembered--or by chemical poisoning, a death toll that equates with the entire population of Italy, the pro-choice crowd now is legislating to extend the violence after birth.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot look away when a child's fundamental human rights are being violated with such lethal actions. Pass the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act now. Mr. Speaker, give us that chance to vote on this."

This topic is critically important, especially in light of the heartbreaking news we have already referenced that has come out of New York and Virginia in recent weeks.  I want to start by thanking the gentlewoman from Washington for standing up tonight and telling us her story. The gentlewoman does have an amazing story and an amazing family: a loving husband, Dan; and Ethan and Abigail.  This is a family, and so we know each other's children. I can tell you, Mr. Speaker, that walking through that journey with the gentlewoman as her friend and colleague has been so special to Riley, to me, and to our children, Margaret and George, who love them just the same.  So I thank the gentlewoman so much for standing on the floor tonight and having the courage to tell her amazing story. It just means a lot. So I thank the gentlewoman for that.  Of course, I was stunned to hear the boisterous cheering upon the New York State Legislature's passage of a bill that would significantly loosen restrictions on late-term abortions.  Meanwhile, in Virginia, the Democratic Governor recently threw his support behind similar legislation and made comments that served as a horrific defense of born-alive abortions.  For the purpose of tonight's discussion, we have got to call born-alive abortion what it is, and it is infanticide.  Here in Congress, part of our job is to debate the issues. Our dialogue surrounding legislation is a critically important component of the democratic process in this country.  Still, no matter how our stances on abortion may vary, I hope we can all agree that, if an abortion fails and a child is born alive, the child must be given the same medical care that any other living, breathing infant would otherwise be given.  I want to take this opportunity to reassure the people I represent in Alabama that I remain unapologetically pro-life. I believe that life begins at conception, and I am opposed to abortion at any stage.  I am severely disturbed that this country now requires written legal provision to protect living babies. But, sadly, in the aftermath of this news coming out of New York and Virginia, it is clear that this step is immediately necessary.  That is why I am proud that the House of Representatives has wasted no time in acting, and I especially appreciate my colleagues, Mr. Scalise and Mrs. Wagner, who have been working tirelessly to force a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, a bill I cosponsored that would protect babies who are born alive during failed abortion procedures.  Again, to my colleague, I thank her so much for organizing and having this special hour tonight. This is a critically important issue, and I hope that we will continue to have these discussions not just tonight but in the days moving forward."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Indiana, Jackie Walorski. We are classmates and came in to Congress almost 7 years ago. I am so grateful to her for pulling this Special Order together tonight to talk about the most vulnerable in our society and talk about the right to life.  To the gentlewoman from Washington State, I have to say her story moves us all, and we are so excited about her growing family.  I cannot thank Mrs. Roby enough for her support, her passion, and her dignity when it comes to supporting life--all of my colleagues who are here with us tonight and stand with us on this legislation.  Above all, I want to say, Mr. Speaker, that I believe our President, last week at the National Prayer Breakfast, said it best:       All children, born and unborn, are made in the holy image      of God. Every life is sacred, and every soul is a precious      gift from Heaven.  None of us could say it any better than that.  I never thought the time would come when I would have to actually argue, fight, debate, and stand for providing healthcare to infants after they are born. Yet here we are. There are, apparently, many legislators who believe it is okay to allow a child to die after it has been born.  When I first heard the news of State officials in New York and Virginia believing that it is acceptable to limit healthcare for newborn babies, I was horrified. But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, it is not just in the Commonwealth of Virginia and the State of New York. In fact, only 26 States have affirmative protections for children born alive after attempted abortions--only 26 States.  In fact, in recent days, Vermont, Rhode Island, and New Mexico are considering legislation to loosen the late-term abortion restrictions that have gone forward in Virginia and New York. In fact, New Mexico's House passed H.B. 51, which would effectively permit abortions up until birth and eliminate all restrictions thereafter.  To me, it is unthinkable that if a baby is born alive, anyone's first instinct could be anything but to try to save that precious, innocent life by any means possible.  Our babies are some of the most innocent, most vulnerable members of our society, and it is our responsibility, our duty, our calling to make sure that they are cared for.  Every year, babies survive late-term abortions and are left to die on tables, in bedpans, in operating rooms. This should not happen in the United States of America. It is a flagrant violation of our Constitution and an offense against women and children.  I implore my colleagues to support our bill, H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. Mr. Speaker, for the next 25 days, until we can put forward a discharge petition, we will bring the born-alive act and ask for unanimous consent that it be passed by the full House. This should not be in question. This is a piece of legislation that was passed in the 115th Congress. We will do that the next 25 days until we can put together a discharge petition and force it to a vote on the floor of the United States House of Representatives.  Last week, I was told, when I offered the unanimous consent decree, that it was the ``wrong time'' to fight for the most basic of human rights. Well, Mr. Speaker, I say it is always the time to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves. I ask my colleagues to join me, join us, in this fight for innocent, newborn babies.  I thank the gentlewoman for her courage and her standing up for life.  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends who are here, Jaime, Representative Roby, and Representative Ann Wagner standing here, and I reiterate the reason we are here is that we are serious about this.  I did the unanimous consent tonight and asked the Speaker to bring that bill down right now and bring it to a vote.  This is an issue of what is right and what is wrong. This is an issue where we have been able to rise up together tonight and speak for those who not only can't speak for themselves but those that could potentially be born alive in this country and given a lethal injection by a doctor or some other medical professional.  What is going on in this country is absolutely horrific."

In the face of such an onslaught, let the miracles of conception, pregnancy, and childbirth serve as a solemn reminder of the constant fight for life. On this, there should be no question that Members of Congress from both parties should agree to the fact that every child born into this world has the right to live.  We must stand together for life and the unborn and protect those who cannot protect themselves when handed abortion's death sentence.  I pray that one day each and every life, born and unborn, is respected, valued, and given the chance to pursue his or her dreams. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 962.

This country was founded to preserve our inalienable rights: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Abortion, the murder of innocent children, cannot coexist with our fundamental beliefs. Late-term abortion is particularly brutal. It includes tearing limbs from bodies and stopping beating hearts.  Only seven countries, including China and North Korea, have legalized this practice. The United States, Mr. Speaker, should not be in that same category as known human rights abusers.  Proponents of abortion claim pro-life policy is an attack on women's rights, but doctors have determined late-term abortions, Mr. Speaker, endanger the mother more than giving birth. The best way to protect women's rights is to protect life.  I close with a little story. Before my mama left this Earth to meet her savior, she was in and out of consciousness, Mr. Speaker. At one point, she had talked to her father, who had passed away long before her, and her brother, who had passed away in the Second World War, and my daddy, who had gone before her just a couple years prior.  She was looking off into the corner, and I said: What are you looking at, mama?  She said: Baby, I am looking at all those sweet little babies up there.  Mr. Speaker, I firmly believe that my mother was looking at some babies that had been murdered.  I urge my colleagues to stand with me to protect the unborn.

Mr. Speaker, abortion advocates used to say they wanted abortion to be ``safe, legal, and rare.'' Now, abortion advocates have reached new levels of disregard for new human lives by openly promoting infanticide. And legislation that would prohibit doctors from leaving born-alive infants to die cannot even get a vote under this new majority in this House of Representatives.  Bills such as the Reproductive Health Act, RHA, which was recently passed with celebration in New York, are starkly at odds with reasonable limits on abortion that most Americans support and exposes the extreme agenda of the pro-abortion movement. The RHA would expand upon Roe v. Wade's already wide protections for access to abortion.  In New York, an abortionist no longer needs be a licensed physician. If an abortion is not successful and the child is born alive, the law offers no protections for the life of the baby. It is almost unthinkable, Mr. Speaker. Such a horrifying bill should be met with disgust and outrage, not celebrated.  It is clear that the value of life has eroded in our culture. Without a society that questions, ``What are the rights of the unborn?'' legislators can use their power to eliminate the right to life and promote the idea that life is dispensable.  Proponents of the New York and similar Virginia legislation should ask whether these policies truly reflect a society where women are valued or where unwanted babies are worthy of protection.  In a culture where aborted babies are collateral damage in so-called women's healthcare, we should all fear that, following unborn children and newborns, there will soon be new targets for disposal."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, since I was a freshman in high school, I wanted to become a physician. I was blessed to get to do that. By the time of my second year in medical school, my wife and I had our first daughter, and most of us were trying to decide what type of doctor we were going to be. The moment that little girl was born, I knew that I wanted to spend my medical career delivering babies.  I think my wife can attest that, for the next 30 years of my life, most of my waking moments were spent with somebody in labor. I was so blessed to get to participate in that wonderful moment. I was blessed to get to go to Congress and represent the people of Kansas.  I woke up a couple weeks ago to the cheering of State legislators from New York and their Governor. I turned up the volume to see what the fuss was. The fuss was they were celebrating their ability to murder the same babies that I had been trying to protect and deliver for the last 30 years of my life.  I don't think there are any Americans--I have never met such an American--who would think that it is right to murder a baby moments, days, or weeks before its due date. It is the most barbaric law I have ever heard of in our society.  If this wasn't enough, I turned the news on a week later, and now they are talking about murdering babies after they were born from so-called failed abortions.  I cannot believe that I live in a society that would even think about this. So I went to my office the next day, and I got my staff together and said, look, we have got some legislation that is going to take care of this. We have our born survivor abortion bill that protects babies after they are born, and then we have a pain-capable bill as well to protect babies who are able to feel pain from being aborted.  My staff looked at me: Right, we have got that legislation.  I said: All we will need is 20 or 30 Democrats to sign on to this. Surely, the Speaker of the House is against late-term abortion. Surely, she is against infanticide.  My staff looked at me with bewildered eyes and said: Congressman, I don't think we are going to find any Democrats to do that.  I wanted to talk a second about the moms, too. No one is talking about how horrible this is going to be for mothers. Moms are going to die from these late-term abortions. As an obstetrician, I never did an abortion, but guess who takes care of complications from abortions. It is obstetricians.  I remember the first week I was in residency. I was called to the emergency room, and there before me was a lady in shock. I apologize if this is too graphic, but the situation is so graphic, I have to tell you the details.  This young lady was bleeding out buckets of blood. I found out what had happened is she just had had an abortion done hours before, and now she was hemorrhaging.  I looked at the nurse. I said: What is going on here?  I knew that we needed to take her to the operating room. We found out during the procedure that a piece of that baby was still inside her uterus, and the uterus couldn't clamp down, so she was hemorrhaging.  This is a story I would see over and over again. The later the abortion procedure is done in the pregnancy, the more often we are going to see this. People are going to get perforated uteri. It will be catastrophic for women.  Mr. Speaker, we can't allow this to continue."

It is deeply disturbing to see what is happening across this country, as life is no longer valued and babies are allowed to be killed, their lives snuffed out in the final moments before they are born and after they are born.  Like my colleague from Kansas before me, I was shocked when I turned on my TV, very similarly--and I am sure there are people all across this country who did that--to see the Governor of New York sitting at his table signing this bill and having all these women celebrate it and then even having a building in New York City lit up in honor of this celebration. But what were they celebrating? They were celebrating not only the demise of human lives in late-term abortion, when, as Dr. Marshall said, they could be born alive in a hospital and given medical care, and have a productive, full life; they could have permission to have that life snuffed out; but then to have the death, perhaps, of the woman as well, at the hands of that procedure.  A lot of people are unfamiliar of how a late-term abortion is done and what these individuals in New York were celebrating. It is graphic, but people need to know what happens.  The woman's uterus is dilated, and forceps are put in there, and a limb of the baby, in the womb, is grabbed hold of. Steel forceps grab hold. They find a leg or they find an arm. They clamp down, and they pull and they pull until it rips off, and they pull out the leg and they put it in the tray.  And they go in again and they find the other leg. They pull and they rip it off and pull it out.  And then they go in for the arm, and then they pull that out. They pull out the other arm. And then they go in and crush the skull and suck it out.  Now, if this doesn't turn your stomach, America, I don't know what does. And that we could be celebrating this in parts of the country is just not only tragic, it is barbaric, and it has to be stopped.  So that is why, here in Congress, we are trying to pass the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, to stand up and to say, we are better than this as a country. That is not what America is about; that our Founders established this country and the basic rights of all who are created by our Creator, and that is the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.  We want to make sure every American can live out that American Dream, the ones who have the privilege of being born and the ones who, right now, people are celebrating, unborn. We want everybody to have that opportunity of life.

Those were the words of my delivery room doctor as he held my armless and lifeless body in his arms. As he assessed me and my situation, all he could tell my parents is that I was `not viable.'

He says: ``It has now been almost 35 years since those words were spoken over me and a lot has happened since then. By God's grace, I was revived. . . . I learned to feed myself, dress myself, write, type, and drive, all with my feet. I graduated from high school with honors and double majored in college. I met the girl of my dreams, got married 13 years ago, and we have two beautiful kids. Now I am a sought after speaker who shares his story at conferences, churches, schools, colleges and with corporations across the country.  Not bad for a kid that wasn't supposed to lead a full life.''  Viability and independence are terrible indicators of life.  ``I am no less of a man because of my two vacant sleeves. I am a perfect creation crafted by the hands of a careful Creator. I am not the sum of my missing parts. I am a man that God has made with talents, gifts, and abilities. Just like any person who is born blind, deaf, or paralyzed has the same sort of giftings.''  He ended by saying this: ``We are all made in God's image. We are all given talents and abilities. We are all worth being given a chance at life, no matter how small the chance may be, and I am the living example of that.  ``My armless life is worth living, and I am beyond thankful my parents saw that on day one.''

There is no other way to say it. This is an affront to life.  We must demand more from our country and our citizens. We must ensure protections for the youngest and most innocent of our citizens, both inside and outside the womb. We must take care of those who cannot take care of themselves. We must take care of our children. We must take care of and respect and cherish life."

A few weeks ago, many Ohioans joined more than 100,000 pro-life Americans at the annual March for Life here in Washington, D.C. Although, with so little national media coverage of this major event, some may have missed this passionate and growing movement made up of men and women, boys and girls from all walks of life.  Recently, we have witnessed the inhuman policies introduced by multiple States permitting late-term abortions, even, unbelievably, all the way up to birth.  It is past time that Congress pass legislation banning this horrific practice. Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides to reject infanticide and defend the sanctity of human life."

I am a mom of three young kids, Cole, Grace, and Brynn, and I can testify that becoming a mom, bringing a life into the world, is the most amazing thing ever.  With technology today, we can look into the womb; we can see day by day how a baby is developing. It is a miracle to witness and it is proof that we as human beings are not defined by our limits. We are empowered by the potential that we have and who we can become.  So, Mr. Speaker, I am frightened and I am heartbroken that anyone would oppose the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act led by Congresswoman Ann Wagner.  Just as the science is undeniable, it should be unthinkable to deny lifesaving care to a newborn baby.  We have amazing technology. We can do more than ever. It is limitless.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to take a step back, to look at the science, and let this bill come to the floor. It is the right thing to do.  You know, since our founding, we have been a country that cherishes every person's inalienable human right, and it is the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It is in all of us to uphold those values and ensure that we are protecting the dignity of every person as God intended.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackie Walorski for her leadership.

Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in defense of life and the unborn. Over the last few weeks, we have witnessed extreme abortion views pushed in States across the country.  In New York, the State legislature passed and the Governor signed into law an abortion bill so broad it effectively allows abortion on demand until birth while removing protections for infants born alive during an abortion. Barbaric legislation such as this is nothing to cheer about.  In Virginia, the Governor tried to soften the blow of his infanticide endorsement by saying ``the infant would be kept comfortable'' while a decision was made on whether to abort the infant.  These disturbing and extreme trends seeping into the mainstream of the Democratic platform underscore the need for its leaders in Congress to stand up, to fight for life in the face of these abhorrent actions.  Now more than ever, leaders in Washington need to stand up for life.  I stand committed with the millions of pro-life advocates around the country to make sure infanticide is condemned and the voiceless are given a voice."

Sounds pretty much like common sense, doesn't it?  I am a proud cosponsor of Ms. Ann Wagner's bill fighting for the sanctity of life.  As a former pastor, I value each and every life that is brought into this world, and that is why it is imperative that we pass this legislation and put an end to the senseless murders of innocent babies.  Earlier this week, I asked for unanimous consent, before being gaveled out, to bring the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act to the House floor for a vote. Unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues put their party leadership and affiliation over voting for what is morally right.  The statistics are staggering. In just looking at a few States, we found 25 children that were born alive that survived a botched abortion just in 2017. It is concerning to think how much higher those numbers would be if we looked throughout the entire country.  Simply put, I stand with 80 percent of Americans who support legislation to protect the life of a baby who survives a failed abortion.  At a time when States like New York and Virginia are matching abortion laws of North Korea in making it easier to perform abortions until the birth of a child, it is absolutely necessary for us to stand in unity and fight for those who cannot fight for themselves."

Mr. Speaker, in 2012, Ashley and Toribio Cardenas got the best news parents can hear: they are going to have a baby girl.  They got an ultrasound at 16 weeks. They saw the outlines of their new daughter, Audrina. She was gorgeous. They had pure joy.  Right after they left, the sonographer rushes to call the obstetrician. This little gift from God has ectopia cordis. Her heart is outside of her body. Sixteen human beings out of 1 million have this condition, and it is usually fatal.  The doctors tell Ashley she has two choices: either abort Audrina or keep going and pray for the best.  Ashley had to act quickly, because Texas law prohibited abortion after 20 weeks. This happened at 17 weeks.  She felt Audrina in her womb kicking and thriving, and she thought: ``Who wants to take a life away? Who wants to stop a beating heart?''  That is true love.  Audrina was born alive. Ashley saw her, gave her a kiss, and then she was rushed off to the cardiac intensive care room for babies, the ICU. Little Audrina had surgery the very next day.  Here is a picture of her I printed out in the hospital; that beautiful young girl, her heart behind that plate.  Her first year of life, there are wires everywhere. She was on oxygen and had to eat through a feeding tube.  But here that beautiful girl is today with a sign that says: ``#speaknowforkids.'' This is a sign for Audrina and for every kid facing abortion.  Congress, American people, speak now for the kids. Support the bill, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today and will be joined by a number of my colleagues from the State of Michigan to pay tribute to a person that I have known of and got to know as an adult, but I have known Congressman John Dingell virtually all of my life. Having grown up in Michigan and grown up in a family involved in politics in Michigan, I was aware of John Dingell from my earliest days.  He served in this House with incredible dignity and great distinction, longer than anyone else in the history of this country, of this government. In fact, nearly one out of four Members of the House of Representatives in its entire history served with Congressman John Dingell.  Yesterday, several of us made an attempt to fly, we left Andrews Air Force Base in a storm and attempted to fly to Michigan and were, unfortunately, unable to land due to the weather.  We are here and will be able to honor him this evening and also honor him tomorrow at the funeral that will take place here in Washington.  So our thoughts go to the Dingell family, especially to our colleague, John's wife, Congressman Dingell's wife, whom he often referred to as ``the lovely Deborah.'' She is a friend and a colleague. I have known her myself, as well, for as long as I can possibly remember.  I will have more to say about Congressman Dingell, but I think there are just a few aspects of his career that I just want to make sure I noted for the ecord.  The longest-serving Member of this House, he is known not just for the longevity and the quantity of his time here, but for the incredible impact that he had on our country, on our Nation, and on the policies that he believed in and stood for.  He served as the chairman or the ranking member on the House Energy and Commerce Committee from 1981 to 2008, shaping very important legislation on clean air, clean water, protecting endangered animals, advocating for national healthcare. In fact, in every Congress that he served in, he continued the legacy of his father, who preceded him in Congress, by introducing legislation that would guarantee healthcare for every American. Some of the legislative highlights: National Wilderness Act, 1964; Water Quality Act, 1965; National Environmental Policy Act, 1970; Endangered Species Act, 1973; Natural Gas Policy Act, 1978; Prescription Drug Marketing Act, 1988; Clean Air Act Amendments, 1990; Energy Independence and Security Act, 2007; National Instant Criminal Background Check System Improvements, 2008; Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010; FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, 2011.  Any one of these would constitute the highlight of a legislative career, and every one of them are attributable to the work of Congressman John Dingell.  Before I yield to my colleagues, I want to mention one other piece of legislation that he is known for. In my first term--the only term that I shared with Congressman Dingell--we celebrated, as a nation, the 50th anniversary of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Late that evening, commemorating that day, I happened to turn on C-SPAN and was watching old videotape of the signing ceremony where President Lyndon Johnson stood with the civil rights and legislative leaders of our Nation. I saw this tall figure walk into the frame, shake President Johnson's hand, and receive the President's congratulations for his work on that historic piece of legislation.  I went to bed, and the very next day, I got up and walked over here for a session. I sat in that chair right there, next to the one that Congressman John Dingell sat in for all those years, and I spoke to the guy who I saw the night before in a moment of American history. He was still here fighting for the very same things that he had fought for, for so long. I took that as a personal privilege, to have been able to serve with him.  As I said, this is a tremendous loss for our country. It is a tremendous loss for me personally. Our hearts go out to Debbie.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg)."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Flint for yielding. I appreciate the opportunity that we have to stand on the floor tonight as a bipartisan delegation, Republicans and Democrats who are joined together by a love of a great State, the greatest State, Michigan, and the history that is there that includes a gentleman, a leader, like John Dingell.  This is a vision that too often is not seen by constituents back in the district, isn't it? They often think that if you are a Republican or a Democrat, you are automatically an antagonist for the other side. That is just not true, especially as we work together as a delegation.  I learned one thing of many things, but one thing I will share tonight from John D. Dingell, Jr. I will let that rest a little bit and let it build to what in the world I am going to say that I learned specifically from John Dingell that was unique, special, and important to me and that I hope I never forget.  It was in 1983 that I first met John Dingell. I was a freshman in the State House of Representatives. I was in Adrian, Michigan, the county seat of the house district I represented. We were there for a ribbon cutting. I heard a commotion going on through the room, and the commotion was simply this: Big John Dingell is about here. He is about to arrive.  Well, I had never met big John Dingell or John Dingell at all. Mr. Speaker, like Mr. Kildee, I knew it was a historic moment.  Sure enough, soon he came in. He swept into the room, and I met a man who, yes, indeed, was 6-foot-4. Strong of appearance and presence, he commanded a presence in the room. Yet he shook every single hand in the room, including this freshman member of the State legislature who he had never met, maybe even never heard my name. There was a warmth about that. I learned something from that.  Over the years, seeing him in operation, and then, ultimately, coming here in 2007 for my first term, and having a chance to go up and sit where he always sat, right over there, to sit and talk with him, initially, very timid, asking legislative questions, but then we got down to important things like: What is your favorite shotgun? What are your favorite hunting sports? Who, indeed, fitted your shotgun to you?  As we began to talk about things later on, it became apparent that, with redistricting, I was going to lose Calhoun County in the district, and I was going to pick up Monroe County, which was John Dingell's county, which had been his father's before him. I was going to be given an opportunity to represent that county as part of the Seventh Congressional District of Michigan.  I remember asking John about Monroe County. He talked about the marshlands. He talked about the fact that, if I were going to come into that, he expected me to feel the same way about water fowling, protecting the resources there, and making sure that the wildlife refuge continued to grow, expand, and meet the needs of coming generations. We talked about that, and we shared those things together.  I found out about the River Raisin National Battlefield Park. A significant war, a loss to the United States, took place there at the River Raisin, but it became the rallying cry that, ultimately, I believe, led to the winning of the War of 1812, ``Remember the Raisin.''  This became part of my district, but it became part of sharing with John Dingell. Mr. Speaker, this is what I learned that I will never forget, and I hope none of us forget it, because it is the way of life that I think leads to a valued life of service.  I had the chance to serve with his son Chris in the State legislature. That was a Dingell who served and then went on to be a circuit court judge. I have the privilege now of serving with Debbie Dingell, our great friend and colleague, who we all have expressed our love to in these last few days, even more than before.  But to serve with John Dingell, I said to him, ``Congressman,'' and he said: No, no. John.  I said: I believe, if the election goes as I think, I am going to get Monroe County. That has been your county for many years. You have loved it. You have loved all about it. I am giving up Calhoun County. How are you going to deal with that, giving away Monroe County?  He said this to me, and this is what I will never forget. He said: My young friend, I never give away a friend.  He said: You know, it is going to be your district. It is going to be your county. But I will never give away my friends in Monroe County.  And he said: You should never give away Calhoun County either.  Marvelous advice. I think it would be good for all of us to remember that in our relationships, not only with our districts and districts that may change, but our relationships with our colleagues. Democrat, Republican, independent, delightful, ornery, whatever, these are friends. The way we respond to them is the same way John Dingell responded in such a way that he had a life that made an impact.  Remember, he served almost 60 years--59 years and 29 days--historic, not because he chose that, but his constituents chose that. They made it possible for him to serve those years. They chose not to term limit him but to say thank you for representing us well.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for giving us the opportunity to do this tonight for a great man, a human, but a great man who loved this country, who served this country. And I am not going to give him away as a friend."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, it is with profound honor and great humility that I rise on this historic floor to recognize and honor the great Chairman John Dingell--the day after the birthday of the great President Lincoln, might I add.  It is clear that John Dingell's life manifested Michigan. He depicted that rich legacy that our State symbolizes. Mr. Dingell was a veteran, a man of dignity, honor, and great fortitude. He most assuredly represented a great America, that great generation. It was his life, this long life, that is compounded by its beginning and its end and that arc of progress that he certainly represents.  Mr. Dingell loved life, and he loved this body. He loved this House of Representatives. He was the man of the House. He was the dean of the House. I lovingly referred to him as ``The Dean.''  As we remember the Honorable John Dingell and reflect on what he meant to this body, to this Nation, and to our great State of Michigan, as somebody who is now representing parts of southeastern Michigan that touched the auto industry he so loved, we can remember his steadfast support of our domestic automakers over the decades.  John Dingell understood the fate of the auto industry and the fate of southeastern Michigan and Michigan as a whole as being forever intertwined, that so many Michigan workers depend on the success of our auto industry, from General Motors to Ford, Chrysler, all the way down the supply chain.  I had the privilege, not as a Member of the House of Representatives, but as a White House appointee in the administration of Barack Obama in the United States Department of the Treasury, on the team that was responsible for saving General Motors and Chrysler--we were called the auto rescue team--10 years ago when Mr. Dingell was raising his voice and leading conversations in standing up for that auto industry. Just as he always has been a ferocious advocate, he was then a ferocious advocate for the Federal initiative to save our automakers from liquidation, to save over 200,000 Michigan jobs, and to stand up for Michigan and everything we represent.  Today, there are thousands of families in Michigan who have kept their jobs because of John Dingell, whose value of work is respected and understood because of John Dingell. To him, that was just another day of work. To him, public service and doing right by his constituents was simply second nature.  Any elected official in our country--and there are 535 of us who sit in the House of Representatives and the Senate--would all be wise to study John Dingell's passion, his mastery of legislating, his dedication to public service. In an era that has sometimes felt very polarizing, somehow this man, this great dean of ours, is the great unifier. And we saw that in his passing. We saw that when we welcomed his casket to the Capitol, and we will see that tomorrow at his funeral in Washington, D.C.  John Dingell knew how important it was to bring industry and labor to the table during the policymaking process. He knew that the auto industry needed a friend, needed a champion for everything that was right by our country and, frankly, our State's origin. He made our Big Three stronger by pushing them to adopt fuel emission standards.  You see, complicated policymaking brings all the stakeholders to the table, and John Dingell knew how to do that. He knew how to do that for the environment; he knew how to do that on safety; and he certainly contributed to a safer, more sustainable industry that has its moonshot views of the future, the visions of the future around zero emissions and zero accidents that are now being shepherded by the workers and innovation and the talent in our State.  John Dingell also strived to do the most good. He understood what service meant. He understood what doing the most good for the most people meant. He fought for our water; he fought for our infrastructure guarantee; and he fought for universal healthcare every day he was here.  He had such a profound respect for his colleagues, even when he disagreed with them. And he loved his wife. He loved his wife for all 40 years.  And we heard howlings from this Michigan delegation. We celebrate and we share that love for the great Debbie Dingell, who has been such a pillar of strength, of openness, of vulnerability.  I told Congresswoman Dingell: You are every woman today. You are every woman in your grief.  And as we recognize her incredible husband, as we recognize him here today in this codified moment and as we carry his torch forward--because that is what we do through the generations is we pick up the torch and keep carrying it forward--we will also continue to carry Congresswoman Dingell forward in her grief and in her adjustment and in the memory of her husband.  As such, John Dingell most assuredly will also be remembered in our great State of Michigan, watching the people come to pay their respects, the servicemen and -women, the thousands of people who felt connected to his life and his life's work. It is what Vice President Biden referred to as his great dignity: his respect for his friends, for his neighbors, for his fellow man.  His contributions to this Nation will not be forgotten, and they will certainly be felt for generations to come.  So today, in a very official way, I say good-bye to the chairman, to the dean, to the Congressman, to the veteran John Dingell.  Thank you. We will miss you dearly."

I join all of our delegation rising to recognize the life and legacy of the chairman, John Dingell, the longest serving member in the history of this Congress--over nearly six decades in Congress. He touched tens of thousands of Americans. Frankly, he impacted this Nation in so many ways.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman was talking about the bills that he authored and led. I was listening to that list. The Endangered Species Act, I was still in high school, and I am not a young man anymore.  The legacy he left this Nation is massive and will be for a long time.  I first met the Congressman years ago when I represented the Governor of Michigan. He came to Washington to talk with Members about workforce development education. I was a bright-eyed 22-year old, eager, ready to go.  I am sure the Congressman was wondering what I was doing there talking to him and representing the Governor. He agreed to meet with me because the Governor had called him and said I was the guy to talk to him about that.  So here was the chairman meeting with a 22-year-old about workforce development--the kindest man. He listened; we talked about it.  I represented a Republican Governor. And there is no question that John Dingell was a Democrat, but partisanship wasn't a priority for John Dingell. He always focused on getting things done effectively for people. It was people over politics, something sometimes we should take to heart around here. We have talked about that.  His question was always: What is good for our people in our State?  The other question he often had, as was referenced, was: What is good for our auto industry?  Lord help you if you are going to take a shot at our auto industry. We are the auto capital, and he defended that fiercely.  A memory I have of meeting with the chairman, one that stands out for me, was about 20 years later, believe it or not. I came in for a meeting with his lead staffer on Education and Workforce Development. He came out of his office. He was going off to vote, I believe. He looked over. He said: I should know you.  I explained why I was there, what I was there to talk about. He said: I can't sign that letter to the White House. I know what you are talking about, but I can do one better. I can call the White House and tell them they need to pay attention to this. Don't mess up the people of my State.  He made that call. He was a man of his word.  When I joined Congress, I had the opportunity to talk a little more with John Dingell. Earlier on, he said to me: Just call me John now.  Unlike many in D.C., he cared to hear what others thought, listened to others speak, not just himself. You know, he always asked me: How is your family? How are they dealing with you being in Congress?  He will be remembered as one of the greatest modern-day legislators. He addressed the tough problems of America and got things done.  He wouldn't just talk about it--and Lord knows sometimes around here they do. He found compromises and solutions. He tackled them. He would wrangle them. He would find a way to bring it to a compromise and solve the problem. He worked across the aisle.  I don't believe his dedicated service to this country will ever be met again. He left an enormous mark on this institution, our country, and the world that we will all remember.  So I say God bless this great Nation with John Dingell, and may God bless you, John David Dingell, Jr."

John Dingell served in Congress with dedication and an earnest sense of duty to his constituents, to his country, and to his solemn oath of office. As a Michigander, support of the auto industry was a high priority of his. From steering the original Corporate Average Fuel Economy Act in 1975 to his efforts on the Energy and Commerce Committee, John Dingell helped to build a legacy of laws in strong support of Michigan's manufacturing workforce and the American auto industry--a champion for the auto industry, a champion for our veterans and for what our government can do when we truly work together for the people.  He was a man of many accomplishments on and off the Hill. And while many may forget the thousands of votes that he voted throughout his career, many may lose track of the legislation he promoted in support of the American people, but as we heard from so many colleagues, staff, family, and friends, people never forget an uplifting voice in a time of need or a simple act of kindness that brightens up their day.  There are many times that people forget, but they often never forget how you made them feel. John Dingell was well known for his sense of humor, friendly spirit, and how he treated everyone with dignity and respect. His is a legacy that we all can only hope to achieve.  John Dingell is and always will be a shining star for the State of Michigan, a north star of direction for us as Members of Congress, and a superstar to all his family--his wife and my colleague, Debbie Dingell--and all of his friends. His life, his legacy, an example of true patriotism, will never fade. John Dingell will never be forgotten.  John Dingell showed this country--while so many say this House doesn't work or there is not a sense of respect for our government, this is a time, as we reflect on his life, to understand that this government is important--that the things we do every day matter to people, and that if we do our job, do it together, we will be contributors to why this is such a great country."

I am going to ramble. I don't have a prepared speech.  I am delighted to be here. I am delighted that you were able to get this time for some of us to speak and honor a legend. And when you think about this last year, man, we have lost some really terrific ones: President Bush, John McCain, others. Certainly, John Dingell joins those ranks as a distinguished American who really made a mark on everyone's life in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I include into the Record an article written by editor Nolan Finley of The Detroit News. I am going to also read to you an email that I got just an hour or two ago from his wife, Debbie, our colleague, who received this from the Ford family.  This is from Mike Ford. Of course, his father was Gerry Ford, a great man, President, Michigander. And he wrote this, it is very brief: Good guy that, again, some of us know, particularly those of us on the west side of our State. You know, he was our dean. And when I became the dean of the Michigan Republican delegation--that was in the early nineties. I have got to say--I was just adding it up here sitting with Tim--I was probably in thousands of meetings with John. Our delegation is close. We stand together on a host of issues, from the Great Lakes to the autos. We often had an agenda we worked together. Our offices were across the hall from each other for a lot of years. Of course, we have known Deborah forever and a day as well.  I had the chance to talk to John Dingell the day before he died, and I talked to him a number of times over the last number of weeks. I read his book, which I would recommend to folks. Might put the R rating next to it, in terms of his language. You can hear him speak, and he had a genuine sense of humor. He had so many stories.  I was asked a little bit earlier today: What about his tweeting?  He tweeted until, literally, the last day or two. For those of you watching tonight, get on Google. Google MLive. That is sort of the Michigan news network. Google: MLive Dingell tweet. This weekend, they ran the top 20 tweets that he did, and they will make you laugh. They really will, especially the one with the bulldog. All of the animal lovers out there, make sure you find this one. He had a sense of humor.  People say: How could a 92-year-old do all this?  Well, let me tell you how. It is because of our committee. The committee has so much jurisdiction, part of which is telecommunications. We were the first ones. We forced the broadcasters. It was actually the Tauzin-Dingell bill, I want to say a lot of years ago, and I had an amendment that was critical there. We passed the Tauzin-Dingell bill. He cared so much about bipartisanship.  We forced the broadcasters to go from analog to digital. That then allowed us all to have devices like this: iPhones and the internet. Instead of using a shoe for your phone, you got something like this that is like the world.  We forced them to go digital, and that allowed this to happen. So guess what? John Dingell, in Congress, we would often sit down. We all meet in Detroit, let's face it. All of us, our delegation, we come from someplace. Mr. Kildee comes from Flint. Tim Walberg is actually lucky and gets on in Detroit. I come from South Bend or Kalamazoo or Grand Rapids. We all come from someplace, but generally, we fly Delta from Detroit back to D.C.  We are all sitting at that A-75 gate. There is John Dingell, a colleague, and he is on his BlackBerry, zipping away, typing just as fast as you could imagine, communicating with people around the world. It is because of the work he did in our committee. That made our lives what they are today.  Whether it is that or the environment or healthcare or pipeline safety, you name the issue--we are sorry Mr. Kildee went to the Ways and Means Committee. Deborah chose right; she went to the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Kildee went to the dark side. Our committee has jurisdiction over so much.  John Dingell was such a leader. He didn't care about who got the credit. He just wanted to get the job done. He sat right over here. When you would come over and ask his advice, you would make sure that you were on his good ear, and he would talk, and he would remember things.  I can remember taking the Congressional Record from some big debates, the Voting Rights Act and others, and I would sit with him here, and we would go through the names, particularly the Michigan delegation, and why they voted this way or that way. He would tell the history. He was here for our lifetime.  He was a gentleman to the very end. He knew the rules. He had respect from both sides of the aisle. He was a guy who we will never see replaced here in this House.  In closing, let me say, even at the end, he was wondering: Did I make a difference?  Of course he did. But here was a guy who made such a difference and a guy who really never thought he would be in this institution. When his dad died, a week before his dad died, he didn't think he was going to run for that seat. It was the people at home who encouraged him to run. When he chose to retire, he didn't push Deborah, nudge Deborah, to run for that seat.  It is hard to imagine, 86 years of a Dingell representing southeast Michigan. What a tribute to a family that has made such a difference in this body, folks who love not only our State, but certainly their constituents.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kildee for doing this Special Order."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I am ready to diversify things in Michigan again.  I really want to pick up where the gentleman left off, because I don't want to talk about John's unbelievable legislative record. I want to talk about two families, the Levin family and the Dingell family, and really about what the Dingell family has meant to my family for almost 80 years.  My dad has been interviewed about this, and my Uncle Carl. But my dad has not revealed the beginning of his relationship with the Dingells, and that is about John's dad, John Dingell, Sr.  My father, Sander Levin's first political memory, aside from listening to fireside chats all around the living room radio coming from President Roosevelt, is of campaigning for John Dingell, Sr., in his knickers. My dad would have been maybe 10 years old, so this is going back to the late 1930s or the early 1940s.  In 1946, I think, John Dingell, Sr., recommended to President Harry Truman that he appoint a lawyer named Theodore Levin to the Eastern District of Michigan to be a Federal judge, and Harry Truman did that. I was looking at the Record, and with all the time things take these days, the President nominated Uncle Ted on July 3, and he was sitting on July 27 of either 1946 or 1947. Things happened at a different speed in those days.  Theodore Levin served for many years, and he was the chief judge of the Eastern District of Michigan.  Earlier than that, before he was chief judge, I think, John Dingell's son, John D. Dingell, Jr., clerked for Judge Levin. It made a profound impact on the chairman. He told me about this all the time.  Imagine getting to go see this very senior Member of Congress to find out about your own great uncle. What was he like? Mr. Dingell loved Uncle Ted.  Then many years later, John Dingell--I don't even know how this happens--he did whatever you do to name the Federal courthouse in Detroit after my great uncle. He did not tell Congressman Sander Levin and he did not tell Senator Carl Levin about this at all until it was a done deal. He didn't want any sense, I guess, of conflict of interest or whatever. He was doing this for his own sake. This was his mentor. So if you go to downtown Detroit, the courthouse is named after Theodore Levin.  Over the years, my dad served here for 36 years. All 36 years, his beloved senior colleague was John Dingell. My dad rose to be the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, and Mr. Dingell was the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee. They worked together on so many things, things that people from other States wouldn't know about, like cleaning up the Rouge River, a symbol of industrialism that now is a much cleaner river, a really clean river, and working to save the auto industry, of course.  Imagine what it meant to my dad to be the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee when we passed the Affordable Care Act, and getting to work with his legendary and beloved senior colleague from Michigan who had introduced universal healthcare in this country every Congress since he entered in 1955, to get to work together to advance the ball, not achieving universal healthcare, but achieving so much through the Affordable Care Act.  I don't know how to say good-bye to Mr. Dingell. Like Mr. Kildee, he scared the heck out of me. He was gruff. He was big. But for the sparkle in his eye, I am not sure I would have even approached him.  He was always willing to sit down, no matter how big and powerful he was. He was always willing to listen. The advice he gave was unfailingly honest and direct. A lot of times, you couldn't repeat exactly the advice, all of the words in the advice he gave, but it was really special to me.  I am not sure I am willing to say good-bye to Mr. D. I will just say Godspeed to someone who, to me, will always be the dean of the House and represent what this body is supposed to be: down to Earth and sophisticated at the same time, highly principled, and expert at making the sausage.  This is the people's House, and John Dingell was the people's Representative."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the incredibly strong city of Flint.  I had a unique relationship with Congressman Dingell, who we lovingly called ``The Dean'' in Michigan. Because I was a young activist, ``radical,'' always out there protesting for clean air, protesting for good-paying jobs, and he was the person who, even though we had different styles and different approaches to various issues, he never reduced or tried to silence my voice and many of the voices of the young people who were really trying to get the Clean Air Act to be put in place and have corporate polluters be held accountable.  As I transitioned into elected office in the Michigan Legislature and became a State representative, within a few months of being a State representative, there was a corporate billionaire who owned a bridge, and there was this whole, huge controversy around whether or not he had a permit or whether or not he was following the environmental impact statement process that is there on the Federal level.  This is a community where one in five children has asthma. This is the community I was raised in. It was the first issue that came before me as a member of the State legislature in Michigan, and I was at a loss. Many people said, Congressman Dingell, The Dean, has historical, institutional knowledge of this company, and you should sit down with him and talk to him.  I was completely taken aback and could not believe that Congressman Dingell reached out to me right away and also got my residents at that time a hearing, which you don't usually get with the U.S. Coast Guard, a hearing that happened in a public school right in the center of the neighborhood that was directly impacted.  We had over 500 residents that finally felt heard, many of them giving testimony after testimony of why a corporation needed to follow the rules, needed to follow the processes for the EPA, the Federal Highway Administration, and the number of entities that were involved in possibly a new bridge crossing. What I also incredibly loved is I remember sitting on a panel about immigration reform with Congressman Dingell at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. As a city and State rep, I remember coming in to the capitol, driving about an hour or so. It was a very cold day, and I believe it was snowing. I was disheveled, as I usually am, and I looked to him--if you know Congressman Dingell, Mr. Speaker, he always had the cane, and he would put his cane right between his two knees and just sit there, and he would look up from his glasses.  I looked at him, and I said: Congressman Dingell, I just don't know how you have been doing it for so long. This is so hard because they lie.  He looked at me, and he said--I just loved what he said, because he turned to me, and he always called me young lady--he said: Young lady, there is a saying in India that if you stand still enough at the riverbank--stand still--that your enemies will float by dead.  I have no idea why, but that calmed me because he was teaching me stillness, but he was also teaching me patience. I just felt so much better afterward.  We had an incredible panel that uplifted so many of our immigrant neighbors. Again, from someone who has such a huge and powerful presence and from me, this young activist who carries a bullhorn in her car, and I could sit next to this amazing, incredible person and feel heard, feel seen, and be on a panel with him and serve with him in so many powerful ways around our environmental justice issues.  I will forever remember the humbling experience as his last ride in front of the Capitol, to have been serving now in this Chamber that he served for 59 years, 11 different Presidents. I was telling my 13-year-old son about him. He said: I want to look him up. I want to find out.  I said: You need to, because he is a rarity.  I hope to honor his tremendous legacy by doing the same thing he did, because I know there will be a generation after me that may be different and may have a different style, and I never want to ever shush or silence them in any way and I want them to be heard just like he did for me.  So I want to thank him from the bottom of my heart for teaching me so much. I am just so pleased to have been serving by his side in many ways, but also that he served me and my family for so many years.  I thank Congressman Kildee so much for allowing me to speak about my dear friend, Congressman John Dingell."

We are healthier, and we are closer to completely universal healthcare than we have ever been in our history because of John Dingell.  Not only is our environment healthier and our bodies are healthier, our country is healthier because of what John Dingell did to move forward the fight for civil rights in this country.  John is the dean of the Michigan delegation, but he belongs to us, too. He is the dean of the House. He is the dean of the House for all time. I doubt that any Member will ever match his record of tenure, but I know that no Member will ever match his record of accomplishment.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of Nat ``King'' Cole, who was born one hundred years ago on March 17, 1919 in Montgomery, Alabama.   Mr. Cole is recognized for being one of the most distinguished and exemplary music recording artists of all time and as a talisman for the civil rights movement.   Nat King Cole began his music career with a focus on jazz, having founded the Nat King Cole Trio as a young man. The band quickly became an influential melodic phenomenon. He signed with Capitol Records in 1943, and the release of his first album, The King Cole Trio, followed in 1945. The album was widely successful as it hit the top of Billboard's inaugural album chart. The talented pianist and vocalist went on to record approximately 700 songs under Capitol Record's label, including 150 singles that appeared on the R&B, Pop and/or Country charts of Billboard. Mr. Cole's success caused Capitol Record's legendary Hollywood building on Vine Street to be informally nicknamed ``The House That Nat Built.''   In 1946, he hosted the nationally aired, fifteen-minute ``King Cole Trio Time,'' which was the first broadcast of its kind to have an African American musician as a host. Mr. Cole made history once again in 1956 when he became the first African American performer to host his own network television show, NBC's ``Nat King Cole Show.'' He also appeared in numerous films, including St. Louis Blues and Cat Ballou.   Along with his legendary musical career, Mr. Cole is remembered for his milestone leadership in the civil rights movement. After purchasing a house in the all-white Hancock Park neighborhood in 1948, he became a target of the Ku Klux Klan who burned a cross on his family's lawn. This horrific incident spurred him to help overturn a 1920's City of Los Angeles statute that allowed the neighborhood to be segregated.   Before Mr. Cole's premature death in 1965, when he was just 45 years old, his final album, L-O-V-E, reached number four on the Billboard album chart. At that time, Capital Records had sold more than nine million Nat King Cole records. Nat King Cole received many honors including being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, receiving a Recording Academy Lifetime Achievement Award and being featured on a U.S. Postal Service commemorative stamp.   Married in 1948, Mr. Cole and his wife, Maria had five children: Natalie, Carole, Nat Kelly, Casey and Timolin. In 2008, their twin daughters, Timolin and Casey Cole, founded Nat King Cole Generation Hope to help fund music programs for schools across America.   I ask all Members of Congress to join me in recognizing Nat King Cole on the one-hundred-year milestone of his birth. Mr. Cole's life is a lesson in success despite adversity, the triumph of respect, talent and civility coupled with cultural, business and political savvy."

I congratulate them on this exemplary achievement.   On August 29, 2018, the Evergreen Rural Water of Washington held its sixteenth annual Water Taste Test, and the City of Sumas placed first among twenty-three competitors from across Washington state. The judges graded the water samples on taste, odor, and clarity. This is the second time in seven years Sumas has won best-tasting water title in the state.   By placing first in Washington State's Water Taste Test, the City of Sumas then qualified for the Great American Water Taste Test, hosted by the National Rural Water Association in Washington, D.C. On February 6, 2019, the City of Sumas' water sample placed fifth in the nation.   I am incredibly proud to see the City of Sumas' hard work and efforts be recognized at the state and national levels.   Again, I congratulate the City of Sumas on their accomplishments and look forward to enjoying a glass of their water the next time I am in town."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize a celebrated moment for one of San Diego County's true historical landmarks located in my district. It is very rare to have a piece of living history in our community, but we are blessed with such a place on Main Street in Ramona, California, with the Ramona Town Hall. It is both a snapshot of the pioneering spirit of the Old West, as well as evidence of a thriving community spirit. The Ramona Town Hall is celebrating its 125th Anniversary this year and I would like to take a moment to highlight this important achievement.   In 1894, property lots were donated to the community on which to build a structure that would serve the people of the Santa Maria Valley. Designed by architect William S. Hebbard, the Ramona Town Hall, also known as Town Hall of Nuevo and Barnett Hall, would become one of the largest, and oldest, adobe structures in Southern California and serve as Ramona's first high school, bank, library, movie theater, justice court and community dance hall.   Ramona Town Hall was also home to many of the town's religious groups while their churches were being built, as well as the birthplace of many other local organizations, including the Ramona Grange, the Santa Maria Masonic Lodge, the Ramona Pioneer Historical Society, the Ramona Chamber of Commerce, the Ramona Art Guild, the Town Hall Players and the Ramona Council of Arts, Unlimited. Events that took place at Ramona Town Hall included temperance meetings, Turkey Days, voting polls, 4-H Youth benefits, political meetings, as well as community theater and silent film festivals. The Ramona Town Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.   Despite this proud history, the fate of Ramona Town Hall at times became seriously in question. Since its inception, Ramona Town Hall has operated solely on fundraisers, grant monies, private donations and rent collected for a variety of events. While always seemingly in demand, there was a very real possibility at one point of the Ramona Town Hall closing its doors. Thankfully, the people of Ramona have never allowed this to happen and, due to the faithful service and dedication of private citizens on the Ramona Town Hall Board of Trustees, they help maintain and manage the Town Hall to ensure that it remains viable, available to the community, and a continued source of local pride. I have had the honor and pleasure myself of speaking with my constituents on several occasions at the Ramona Town Hall.   I want to congratulate the people of Ramona, particularly the private citizens who volunteer their time and resources toward ensuring the Ramona Town Hall continues to serve its intended purpose. Their commitment toward this cause is a reflection of the Ramona community as a whole and provides confidence to us all that the Ramona Town Hall will continue to be a local asset and treasure for years to come."

She was a founding member of the Community Coalition for substance abuse Prevention and Treatment. In fact, she was the first staff person hired and developed the Coalition's Prevention Network. That network brought together social service providers from South LA to address substance abuse in the community.   Loretta had a towering passion for justice and a caregiver's attention to detail. She founded Healthy African American Families (HAAF) in the wake of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising to engage universities, think tanks, and community members together to seek solutions to longstanding health problems, including the scourge of pre-term births in the African American community. For this work she received two honorary doctorates and, last year, she received the UCLA Medal, the university's highest honor, for her career of working to address inequalities in health and health outcomes.   She is best known for co-developing methods that give underserved communities a greater role in planning and implementing academic research. Community-Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR) calls for transparency, accountability and equal power-sharing between academics and communities. In 2007, with UCLA professor Kenneth Wells, she published the CCPR model in the Journal of the American Medical Association.   In doing so, she demonstrated another tenet of CPPR--that community members co-author research publications alongside academics. Loretta had that rare ability to serve as a bridge between the worlds of policy and research, and the everyday lives of the people she cared about most. She mentored hundreds of physicians, nurses, public health practitioners, social scientists and community members to do the same. Those people went on to become tenured faculty members at medical schools, state officials and senior advisers in Congress and the White House.   A native of Massachusetts, she earned a BA in psychology in 1963 and Master's degree in criminal justice in 1972, both from Northeastern University in Boston. She had been community faculty member at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science since 2010. A former foster youth herself, she fostered 20 children in addition to raising her daughter. She made a real difference in the world during her 77 years.   Loretta always insisted that ``Everyone deserves the right to live, everyone deserves good health care, and we are all responsible for making it happen.'' I mourn her passing with all of those who loved her. I am grateful for her compassion, her dedication, and the work to which she dedicated her life: to empower families to lead truly healthy lives."

Though each program participant is unique, I am proud to say that the reaction to working with them is universally positive.

Somhita came to us from the University of Melbourne, as an honor student pursuing Politics, International Studies, Media and Communications. Over the past month, I have watched Somhita work as an incredible leader, making assessments that are logical and well-thought out. She is dedicated and not afraid to champion issues that are important to her. She has also taught us so much about her home country and the many values we have in common. I have absolutely no doubt that Somhita's dynamic personality and skillset will help her to be the best that she can be in all her future endeavors. Somhita's generosity in serving Hoosiers, hard work, and positive presence have all been an incredible asset to our office, and we look forward to seeing her future success.  Moreover, the program would not be where it is without a dedicated leader with a strong vision, and an unwavering spirit, making it all possible. I would like to thank Eric Federing for his continued leadership as the director and founder of the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Programme. Under Eric's supervision, we see individual U.S.-Australia relationships are thriving, forging new friendships that are a testament to our shared prosperity. Today's political climate calls for a global vision, and I am thankful that Eric continuously works to promote the exchange of views and ideas among leaders of the future. It has been an honor to have Somhita in our office, and I thank her for her hard work and commitment to public service. I wish her the best wherever her next journey may take her."

Ms. Elizabeth Weidner of Dieterich has been named one of the top honorees in Illinois by the 2019 Prudential Spirit of Community Awards program, an annual honor conferred on the most impressive student volunteers in each state and the District of Columbia.  Ms. Weidner is being recognized for bringing attention to the tragedy of childhood cancer through a website, social media, speeches, lobbying efforts, the recognition she has received as a top contender in several pageants, as well as being an ambassador for this cause. I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Weidner a short while ago. I came away from our discussion very impressed with her in-depth knowledge of government programs aimed at addressing childhood cancer as well as her passion and character.  It's crucial that we encourage and support the kind of selfless contribution this young woman has made. People of all ages need to think more about how we, as individual citizens, can work together at the local level to ensure the health and vitality of our towns and neighborhoods. Volunteers like Ms. Weidner are inspiring examples to all of us, and are among our brightest hopes for a better tomorrow.  The program that brought this young role model to our attention--The Prudential Spirit of Community Awards--was created by Prudential Financial in partnership with the National Association of Secondary School Principals in 1995 to impress upon all youth volunteers that their contributions are critically important and highly valued, and to inspire other young people to follow their example. Over the past 24 years, the program has become the nation's largest youth recognition effort based solely on community service. It has honored more than 125,000 young volunteers at the local, state and national level.  Madam Speaker, Ms. Weidner should be extremely proud to have been singled out from the thousands of dedicated volunteers who participated in this year's program. I heartily applaud Ms. Weidner for her initiative in seeking to make her community a better place to live, and for the positive impact she has had on the lives of others. Her actions show that young Americans can--and do--play important roles in our communities, and that America's community spirit continues to hold tremendous promise for the future."

Alan's stewardship of his family's restaurant in California's 33rd Congressional District, Canter's Deli, was crucial in making it a fixture in Los Angeles culture and a gathering place for people of all ages and degrees of fame.  Born in Los Angeles on May 2, 1936, Alan started out as a mechanic, with a love for racing cars and tinkering with new ways to drive faster. However, on the advice of his newly pregnant wife, Alan turned to the restaurant business in the 1950s, just as the deli expanded from its original Boyle Heights location, opened in 1931, to the Fairfax district.  Though he started as a pickle packer and delivery boy, Alan eventually took over his family's deli and dedicated nearly every waking minute over the next six decades to his customers, sometimes working 18-hour shifts in a day. Alan took on all of it, even the seemingly menial tasks, like cutting fruit, pickling, selecting ingredients, and tending to the kitchen equipment. Alan's mechanical expertise, learned from his years racing and fixing cars, kept the place running even when a machine acted up. As the family patriarch for so many years, Alan taught his children how to run the business just as his father taught him.  Canter's Deli, ``the soul of Fairfax Avenue,'' served not only its neighbors, but also post-concert crowds, musicians, actors, and even presidents. Additionally, his selflessness and humor touched all who encountered him.  Alan is survived by his wife; son, Marc; daughter, Jacqueline; and five grandchildren. I hope that Alan's family takes comfort in knowing that his family's legacy will live on in the memories of all the customers he served and the high standards he worked so hard to establish."

Across the country, about 800,000 federal employees went without pay for 35 days during the shutdown from December 22nd to January 25th. This wrongheaded situation was hard on all the affected workers, but it was particularly difficult for the 110,000 affected federal employees who earn $50,000 or less annually. Despite not being paid, more than 420,000 employees were required to work for weeks on end. Worse still, these employees had to live with the uncertainty of not knowing when the shutdown would end, and when they would be paid again. Furloughs and delayed paychecks are not the right way to treat our hard-working employees who provide critical services to Americans across the country, and they are the wrong way to run an effective and functioning government.  Despite a misguided lapse in appropriations, many workers in my community and nationwide admirably and dutifully continued working without pay. Air traffic controllers at the O'Hare International Airport, and other American airports, worked without pay to ensure planes could take off and land safely. TSA Agents worked without pay so that Americans could travel safely, keeping our economy thriving. IRS and Treasury employees worked without pay to ensure our constituents could process their tax returns and plan for their financial security. HUD employees worked without pay so that society's most vulnerable, our low-income and senior citizens, had safe housing. USDA employees worked without pay so that our food would be inspected, and so working families could receive food aid, preserving public health and family wellbeing. Employees at the National Park Service worked without pay to protect our sacred public spaces. National Weather Service Employees worked without pay to provide critical weather information that we rely on daily for comfort and accessibility. Madam Speaker, these employees worked tirelessly for the good of their country, even when their government wasn't working for them.  Unfortunately, this lack of pay required working families to turn to food banks, food pantries and other charitable organizations. These incredible civic organizations, including many faith-based organizations and places of worship, are the lifeblood of our local communities. Their life-saving services during this difficult time will not be forgotten.  Moving forward, I am committed to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan fashion to prevent future government shutdowns at all costs so that no Americans--including federal workers and citizens who rely on critical government services--will have to suffer the consequences of another government shutdown.  To quote the late civil rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr.: ``The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.'' In this moment of severe controversy, and in the face of extraordinary challenges, federal workers persevered for the betterment of their community. I want to recognize the vital work and sacrifice of these brave Americans. Their outstanding performance during the shutdown will always be remembered."

Ms. Coley began caring for foster children thirty-three years ago, and has since cared for over 100 children in her home in Hall County, Georgia. In June of 2016, Ms. Coley's house tragically caught fire and burned to the ground, forcing her to start from scratch and completely rebuild. But that did not stop her from welcoming children back into her home just six months later, as soon as she moved in.  Ms. Coley's willingness to foster teenagers makes her an especially valuable foster parent. She says that the most rewarding part of being a foster parent is when she has the opportunity to witness her foster children succeeding after they have left her home, and often times giving back to their community, just as she has done for many years. The hardest part of fostering, she says, is when they eventually leave her home.  The State of Georgia has approximately 14,400 children living in foster homes, which is why we are especially fortunate to have citizens like Ms. Coley serving our communities.  All children deserve the opportunity to lead a happy and healthy life, free from any type of abuse or mistreatment, and I want to thank Ms. Martha Coley for the many lives she has touched."

He is among the two longest serving justices in Kentucky history.  Justice Cunningham is from Lyon County, Kentucky. He is a graduate of Murray State University and the University Of Kentucky College Of Law. Cunningham began his career in public service in 1974 as the city attorney for Eddyville, KY, where he served until 1991. He also served as the Public Defender for the Kentucky State Penitentiary from 1974 to 1976. He went on to serve as the Commonwealth's Attorney for the 56th Judicial District from 1976 to 1988, where his peers voted him as Outstanding Commonwealth Attorney of Kentucky. In 1991, he was elected to the Circuit Court. While he was Circuit Judge, he requested and set up a makeshift courtroom in the Eddyville Penitentiary, avoiding the risk of escape when transporting prisoners and saving money for the Commonwealth of Kentucky. On one occasion while doing his courtroom duties, an inmate charged him and physically assaulted him. In 2006, Cunningham was elected to the Kentucky Supreme Court.  In addition to being a lawyer, judge, and justice, Cunningham was a prolific author and published several books, mostly on Kentucky history. One of his books details the history of the state penitentiary at Eddyville, including the major prison riot at Eddyville in the 1920's in which several people were kilIed, including one of Cunningham's ancestors. He also wrote a book on the tobacco wars of West Kentucky in the 1920's.  Justice Cunningham is married to Paula and they have five sons. Cunningham is a veteran of the United States Army, serving on deployments to Germany, Vietnam, and Korea. I thank him for his service in uniform. I also thank him for his long career in the courtroom, fighting for justice and serving with integrity.

Founded in 2008, Honor Flight Chicago provides a once in a lifetime opportunity for Chicago-area veterans of World War II and the Korean War by flying them to Washington, DC to visit memorials dedicated to their service.  Following Ms. Pettinato's graduation from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in 2008, she cofounded the Chicago chapter of Honor Flight. This idea came after Mary asked of her father: ``If you were on your deathbed, what's one thing you would wish you'd done during your lifetime?'' He answered that his wish was to visit the World War II Memorial in Washington. On the subsequent trip they took to the Memorial, Mary was inspired to not only provide this opportunity to her father, but also to thousands of other veterans living in Chicago who might never have the chance to visit this and other historic monuments.  During the decade that Ms. Pettinato served as CEO of Honor Flight Chicago, the organization organized 88 flights from Chicago to Washington. They started with sixty veterans on their first flight; now, they fly upwards of ninety service members on each trip and have had over eight thousand veterans participate in the program over the past ten years.  In 2015, Ms. Pettinato was honored by The Chicago Tribune as one of their `` Remarkable Women'' in a series of profiles written about inspiring women in the area. Mary' s feature focused on her love of family, and how that passion led to the creation of the Chicago chapter of Honor Flight with three other women.  In the Tribune article, Ms. Pettinato offered an anecdote that demonstrates the achievement of Honor Flight Chicago. She recalls, ``I was with one man, he was 92, and he was struggling with some things and having a tough day. As we got off the plane on the return for the welcome home celebration--he (had been) in a wheelchair the entire day--he said, ``I want to walk.'' And he got out of his wheelchair and he had someone on his left and someone on his right and we were holding him very firmly and he walked through this procession. Someone leaned over and said, ``Bob, how was your day?'' And he stopped and said, ``I've never been to heaven, but I'm guessing today was mighty close.''  Madam Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing the ten years of dedication Ms. Pettinato has shown to the veterans of Chicago. Through the Honor Flight experience, she has brought joy to many of our country's heroes."

Often times customers run into their neighbors, friends or familiar members of the community while walking the aisles at Haddad's to pick up their favorite products and providing them with a sense of community and comfort. Local businesses such as Haddad's are a critical part of our local economy and owners such as Mark should be celebrated for all of their hard work in creating a place for the community to come together and shop locally. 100 years of business is an outstanding achievement and I wish Haddad's continued success in the time to come serving the Peoria area.  It is because of businesses such as Haddad's West Peoria Market that I am especially proud to serve Illinois' 17th Congressional District.

                "speech":" Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the life and legacy of Mr. Frank Robinson, a trailblazing figure who was a Major League Baseball (MLB) Hall of Famer, the first black manager in Major League Baseball, and had an amazing career that spanned 21 seasons. Mr. Robinson passed away on Thursday, February 7, 2019 at the age of 83.  Starting out in an era when Mays, Aaron, Mickey Mantle and Ted Williams were the big hitters, Mr. Robinson more than held his own more than 2 1 seasons. He finished with 1,812 RBis, hit .294, played in the World Series five times and homered in each of them. Additionally, he had a .389 on-base average boosted by 1,420 walks against 1,532 strikeouts. Extremely alert on the bases, he had 204 steals.  Mr. Robinson was born August 21, 1935 in Beaumont, Texas. He was the youngest of Ms. Ruth Shaw's 10 children. His parents separated when he was an infant, and he accompanied his mother to Northern California when he was 4. Mr. Robinson attended McClymonds High School in Oakland, California. At 14 years old, he began playing for local coaching legend George Powles, and won an American Legion national championship.  In the days before the Major League Draft, Robinson was signed by the Cincinnati Reds out of McClymonds in 1953 for a $3,500 bonus and made his Major League debut three years later. He won the NL Rookie of the Year Award and made his first All-Star appearance that season.  During 10 seasons with the Reds, Robinson averaged 32 home runs and was a six-time All-Star. He won the 1961 NL Most Valuable Player Award and finished fourth in NL MVP Award voting in 1962 and 1964.  In December 1965, Robinson was the centerpiece in what would ultimately be one of the most lopsided trades in baseball history, going to the Baltimore Orioles for pitchers Milt Pappas and Jack Baldschun and outfielder Dick Simpson. Robinson became an instant hit with the Orioles in 1966 as the unanimous AL MVP and a Triple Crown winner.  On May 8, he became the only player ever to hit a home run completely out of Baltimore's home park, Memorial Stadium. The drive came against Cleveland ace Luis Tiant and the spot where the ball sailed over the left-field wall was marked by a flag that read ``HERE'' that remained in place until the Orioles left for Camden Yards in 1991.  Mr. Robinson batted .316 with 49 home runs and 122 RBIs during his first season in Baltimore. He then homered in the first inning of the 1966 World Series opener at Dodger Stadium and capped off the four-game sweep of Los Angeles with another homer off Don Drysdale in a 1-0 win in Game 4. Mr. Robinson hit two home runs against the Reds in teaming with future Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson to win another crown for the Orioles in 1970.  Mr. Robinson was an All-Star in five of his six seasons with Baltimore, reaching the World Series four times and batting .300 with 179 home runs. He was traded to the Dodgers before the 1972 season and played for the California Angels in 1973 and was dealt to Cleveland late in the 1974 season.  Mr. Robinson hit 586 home runs and was a 14-time All-Star and the only player to win Most Valuable Player Awards in both leagues--1961 for the Reds in the National League and 1966 for the Orioles in the American League.  Mr. Robinson managerial debut came 28 years after Jackie Robinson broke the MLB color barrier as a player. He became Major League Baseball's first African American manager on April 8, 1975, as the manager of the Cleveland Indians. Mr. Robinson, still an active player, celebrated the occasion with a home run in the Indians' 5-3 victory over the New York Yankees.  Mr. Robinson also managed the San Francisco Giants, the Orioles and the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals over the course of his career.  Mr. Robinson served as manager of the Orioles from 1988-91. In 1989, he was named the American League Manager of the Year for guiding the Orioles to an 87-75 record, 33 more victories than the previous season.  Three teams--the Reds, Orioles and Indians--have retired Robinson's No. 20. All three teams honored Robinson with statues. And he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in 2005.  Aside from being one of the great home run hitters, Mr. Robinson was innovator in his involvement of the development of the youth aspect of the game. In 2012, he was hired by MLB as the vice president of player development. He managed to emphasize important aspects such as the Urban Youth Academy and the Future Game, as well as the Civil Rights Game. He was given the special position to become Honorary President of the American League.  Mr. Robinson was not hesitant to give appreciation to the Negro League players who came before him. His youth academy emphasized expressing to future generations the importance of the game outreach to urban areas to keep the youth in the game.  Mr. Robinson was a trailblazer and had a huge influence on Major League Baseball. His legacy will forever be a part of Major League Baseball and his dedication to community embodies the spirit of America. We cannot match the sacrifices made by Mr. Robinson, but surely, we can try to match his sense of service. We cannot match his courage, but we can strive to match his devotion.  Mr. Robinson's survivors include his wife Barbara, and daughter Nichelle.  Madam Speaker, I celebrate the life and legacy of Mr. Frank Robinson."

                "speech":"Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, this week the Senate will resume our work in the personnel business by considering yet another of President Trump's qualified judicial nominees.  Eric Miller has been chosen to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and one look at his legal career to this point says he is well prepared to do so.  Mr. Miller is a graduate of Harvard and the University of Chicago, where he served on the Law Review editorial staff. He has held prominent clerkships on both the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. His record of public service at the Justice Department and in private practice reflects a legal mind of the highest caliber.  I hope each of my colleagues will join me in voting to advance the first circuit court nominee of this new Congress. That will be 31 since President Trump took office. But first, in just a few hours, the Senate will vote on advancing a straightforward piece of legislation to protect newborn babies. This legislation is simple. It would simply require that medical professionals give the same standard of care and medical treatment to newborn babies who have survived an attempted abortion as any other newborn baby would receive in any other circumstance. It isn't about new restrictions on abortion. It isn't about changing the options available to women. It is just about recognizing that a newborn baby is a newborn baby, period.  This bill would make clear that in the year 2019, in the United States of America, medical professionals on hand when a baby is born alive need to maintain their basic ethical and professional responsibilities to that newborn. It would make sure our laws reflect the fact that the human rights of newborn boys and girls are innate; they don't come and go based on the circumstances of birth. Whatever the circumstances, if that medical professional comes face-to-face with a baby who has been born alive, they are looking at a human being with human rights, period.  To be frank, it makes me uneasy that such a basic statement seems to be generating actual disagreement. Can the extreme, far-left politics surrounding abortion really have come this far? Are we really supposed to think that it is normal that there are now two sides debating whether newborn, living babies deserve medical attention?  We already know that many of our Democratic colleagues want the United States to remain one of seven nations in the world that permit elective abortions after 20 weeks--seven countries, including North Korea, China, and the United States of America. But now it seems the far left wants to push the envelope even further. Apart from the entire abortion debate, they now seem to be suggesting that newborn babies' right to life may be contingent--contingent--on the circumstances surrounding their birth. Well, evidently, the far left is no longer convinced that all babies are created equal, but the rest of us are still pretty fond of that principle.  My colleagues across the aisle need to decide where they will take their cues on these moral questions. On the one hand, there are a few extreme voices who have decided that some newborn lives are more disposable than others. On the other side is the entire rest of the country.  I would urge my colleagues: Let's listen to the voices of the American people. Let's reaffirm that when we say every life is created equal, we actually mean it. Let's vote to advance the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act later today.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, before Congress went out of session 2 weeks ago, President Trump announced that he was declaring a national emergency to redirect funds to the construction of a border wall. It was a lawless act, a gross abuse of power, and an attempt by the President to distract from the fact that he broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for the wall.  Let me give a few reasons why the President's emergency is so wrong.  First, there is no evidence of an emergency at the border. Illegal border crossings have been declining for 20 years. Just this morning, a group of 58 former senior national security figures, including Chuck Hagel and Madeleine Albright, released a statement saying: ``Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border.''  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Even the President himself, who is now declaring an emergency, halfway through his meandering speech proclaiming the emergency, said: ``I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do it [build the wall] much faster.''  If there was ever a statement that says this is not an emergency, that is it. He said he didn't need to do this. So, my colleagues, my dear colleagues, if we are going to let the President, any President, on a whim, declare emergencies just because he or she can't get their way in the Congress, we have fundamentally changed the building blocks, these strong, proud building blocks that the Founding Fathers put into place.  Second, the President's emergency declaration could cannibalize funding from worthy projects all over the country. We don't even know yet which projects he is planning to take the funds from. I ask my colleagues to think about that--what important initiatives in your State are on the Trump chopping block? What military project will the President cancel to fund the border wall Congress rejected?  Third, and I made this point a little bit at the beginning, but it bears repeating. Far and away most importantly, the President's emergency declaration is a fundamental distortion of our constitutional order. The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, not the President, and congressional intent on the border wall is clear. The President's wall has been before Congress several times, and not once has it garnered enough votes to merit consideration. In some cases it was with Republican votes. The President said that it was just the Democrats who blocked it. That is not true. There were Republican votes when the wall was on the floor for voting as well.  As the great New Yorker, Justice Jackson from Jamestown, NY, observed, the President's legal authority in the realm of emergencies is at its very weakest when it goes against the expressed will of Congress. In case the will of Congress was not already clear, soon it will be made so. The obvious remedy for President Trump's outrageous and lawless declaration is for Congress to vote to terminate the state of emergency. The House will vote on such a resolution tomorrow, and the Senate will soon follow suit.  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle fashion themselves supporters of the military, defenders of property rights, and stewards of the Constitution, as do Democrats. This vote on the resolution to terminate the state of emergency will test our fidelity to those principles.  Congress should come together to reject in a bipartisan fashion--we have come together before in bipartisan ways. If ever there were one moment that cries out for bipartisan rejection of an overreach of power, this is it. We should reject this naked power grab, this defacement of our constitutional balance of powers, for what seem to be largely political purposes."

It is in all of our interests for the President to achieve a diplomatic resolution with North Korea that achieves a stable peace and the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Failing that, the Congress must continue to pressure a regime that permits gross humanitarian abuses and remains one of the most repressive governments on the globe.  We cannot tolerate the President making concessions without, in exchange, receiving verifiable, enduring, and concrete commitments from North Korea to denuclearize.  President Trump's first summit with Chairman Kim granted his regime the international legitimacy and acceptance that Kim has long craved while undermining our policy of maximum pressure and sanctions, seemingly so the President could have a photo op and make a speech.  Unsurprisingly, the results of that meeting were disappointing. The President claimed, bizarrely and wildly, that North Korea is ``no longer a nuclear threat'' right after the meeting, while the U.S. intelligence community has continually testified before Congress that North Korea has not been denuclearizing and appears unlikely to give up its nuclear weapons. So how can the President say it is no longer a nuclear threat when the same threat existed when he threatened North Korea earlier and after, when he seemed to make nice to President Kim? Meanwhile, the President suspended joint military readiness drills with the South Koreans--drills we have been conducting for 60 years for the safety of East Asia.  No one wants to see a repeat of the same movie. No one wants another summit that is more about photo ops and optics than progress. We are all rooting for diplomacy to succeed, but the President can't be too naive or too eager to reach a deal that gives him the photo op again but that doesn't achieve the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

This is all well and good if the Trump administration ultimately achieves a strong deal that makes progress on China's rapacious trade policies. But we are not there yet, and my message to President Trump is don't back down.  The President has shown the right instincts on China many times. I give him credit for that. I have praised him publicly for that, but at other times, I believe his eagerness for the appearance of accomplishment gets the best of him. Recent history has taught us that when President Trump makes unilateral concessions to China--as he did when he interfered in the sanctions against ZTE--China does very little for us in return.  President Trump must not make the same mistake again, whether by interfering in the U.S. criminal charges brought against Huawei or otherwise decreasing our leverage, until and unless China makes meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable agreements to end its theft of American intellectual property and other trade abuses.  Hopefully, that is where the negotiations are headed. If the President does a good job, I will be the first to praise him. If he backs off or takes some temporary measure in decreasing the balance of trade but doesn't change China's structural rapaciousness against the United States and our intellectual property and our industrial know-how, he will be criticized by me and many others on both sides of the aisle."

This vote has nothing--nothing--to do with that. Read the language. We are talking about situations when expectant parents tragically learn their pregnancy is no longer viable, and there is a fatal diagnosis. What happens in those circumstances should be decided between a woman, her family, her minister, priest, rabbi, imam, and her doctor.  It makes no sense for Washington politicians who know nothing about individual circumstances to say they know better than the doctors or the patients and their families. The bill is solely meant to intimidate doctors and restrict patients' access to care and has nothing--nothing, nothing--to do with protecting children.  Last Friday, the administration announced it was imposing a gag rule on U.S. reproductive healthcare providers and trying to restrict access to healthcare clinics that provide reproductive care. So this vote doesn't occur in a vacuum. It is part of a pattern of actions taken by President Trump and congressional Republicans to limit, deny, or circumscribe a woman's right to healthcare.  I urge the American people to do their own research, read the bill, and see what it says. Most of you will agree with it. Pay attention to the facts and not the false rhetoric. This bill is Washington politics at its worst. I will vote no."

These are the first responders, firefighters, police, and FBI agents who rushed to the towers that fateful day, ran into the fire, smoke, and twisted steel, risking their lives and, later, we learned, risking their health to get people out. These are the union members and construction workers who worked at the pile, breathing in a toxic blend of ash and dust in the days and weeks and months that followed. These are the people, the innocents, who lived downtown when the United States was attacked in the most dastardly attack on American soil.  Right now we have a problem. While these folks are heroes and, sadly, many are suffering--because of the alarming number who are suffering from 9/11-related illnesses, the victim compensation fund is running out of money earlier than expected. The Justice Department recently announced that it might have to cut compensation awards between 50 and 70 percent.  So today I was proud to join Senators Gillibrand and Gardner, as well as a group of our colleagues in the House, to introduce legislation to fix the shortfall of funding and put the victims' compensation fund on sure footing for the foreseeable future.  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrat and Republican alike, to sign on and help us pass this bill and give some hope to the thousands who were brave on 9/11 and who are suffering now.

                "speech":"Madam President, I just listened to the senior Senator from New York--my friend from the gym and the minority leader--deliver some summaries of what he said was in the bill before us, and he implored this body and implored the people watching on C-SPAN to read the bill, stating they would find that all of these terrible things are in the bill.  I see the minority leader has to leave the floor now, but, humbly, I would urge him to come back and show us where any of what he just said is in this bill. What he said wasn't true.  I rise today for a simple purpose. I want to ask each and every one of our colleagues whether we are OK with infanticide. This language is blunt. I recognize that, and it is too blunt for many people in this body, but, frankly, that is what we are talking about here today.  Infanticide is what the abortion survivors--Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is actually about.  Are we a country that protects babies who are alive, born outside the womb after having survived a botched abortion? That is what this is about.  Are we a country that says it is OK to actively allow that baby to die, which is the current position of Federal law? That is the question before us, plain and simple.  Here are the facts. We know that some babies, especially late in gestation, survive attempted abortions. We know, too, that some of these babies are left to die--left to die. No further protections exist today to shield them from this ugly fate, and only some States have protections on their books. We have seen in our national discourse over the last month and a half a few States moving in different ways to undo protections that some of these babies have had at the State level.  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is trying to right this obvious wrong. The bill's terms are simple: A child born alive during a botched abortion would be given the same level of care that would be provided to any other baby born at that same gestational age. That is it.  This bill isn't about abortion. I am pro-life--unapologetically pro-life--but this bill is not about anything that limits abortion. This bill doesn't have anything to do with Roe v. Wade. This bill is about something else. What this bill does is try to secure basic rights, equal rights for babies who are born and are outside the womb. That is what we are talking about.  Over the course of the next hour, as this is debated on the floor, people are going to say a whole bunch of other things. I would ask them to please bring the text of the bill to the floor when they do it and show us whether there is anything about limiting abortion in this bill.  This bill is exclusively about protecting babies who have already been born and are outside of the womb. Every baby deserves a fighting chance, whether that 24-week old baby, fighting for air and fighting for life, having just taken her first breaths, is at an abortion clinic where she survived a botched abortion or she is in a delivery room at the local hospital. Both of those babies are equally deserving of care, protection, and humane treatment, and our laws should treat both of these human beings as babies because they are babies. They have been born, and they are outside of the womb. This really should not be controversial. In fact, my colleagues actually talk this way all of the time. This place feels like about one-third of the people here are currently running for President, so I would like to quote a few of them over the course of the last couple months.  We ought to ``build a country where no one is forgotten, and no one is left behind.'' Amen to that. Amen to that.  ``The people in our society who are most often targeted by predators are also often the voiceless and the vulnerable.''  That is true.  Another offered a promise to ``fight for other people's kids as hard as I fight for my own kids.''  Last week, our colleague from Vermont announced his campaign by saying: ``The mark of a great Nation is . . . how it treats its most vulnerable people.'' Bernie Sanders was right.  Now is the chance, in this body, to make good on that promise. Now is the chance to protect one of the most vulnerable populations on the land imaginable--tiny, defenseless, little babies, just having taken their first breath--or was that claptrap for the campaign trail or sound-bites? Or do people mean the stuff they say around here?  Let's put it another way. Today's vote asks whether or not you want to take the side of people like Virginia's disgraced Governor Ralph Northam?  Last month, before the news of his hideous yearbook broke, Governor Northam made clear that a baby born alive during an abortion could and maybe ought to be killed if that is what the parents and doctors decided they wanted to do after a debate. That was his position: You should make the baby ``comfortable,'' and then there could be a discussion about whether or not you throw that little baby into the trash can. That is what he actually talked about on the radio for a day and a half last month.  Governor Northam is disgraceful for a whole host of reasons, but unlike some other people, he actually told the truth about what he wants. He wants a society where some people count more than others, and other people are worth less than others. He wants a society where some people can be pushed aside if they are inconvenient. In reality, that is what we are voting on today.  Some of my colleagues want to write into our law a kind of permanent exception: ``Every human being should be protected from cruel and inhuman treatment--unless that human being came into the world through a botched abortion.'' Then, you can decide later if you want to kill them.  Tonight, what we are going to vote on in the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act is a chance to see whether we are serious when people around here say they want to protect the innocent, speak up for the voiceless, and defend the defenseless. Tonight, we are going to have the opportunity to do exactly that. We can come to the aid of innocent, voiceless, defenseless little babies who have just taken their first breaths by protecting him and her from mistreatment and neglect.  This should be, frankly, the easiest vote we ever cast in this body, but the prospect of what we are voting on here is threatening to one of the most powerful interest groups in America. The abortion industry has taken to attacking this bill wildly over the course of the last 2 weeks, even though, as we made clear repeatedly and as the text of this bill makes indisputably clear, this bill has nothing to do with abortion itself. Nothing in this bill changes the slightest letter of Roe v. Wade. Nothing touches abortion access in this bill.  This bill is about living and breathing babies who are alive outside the womb. That is all that the text of this bill does, but Planned Parenthood and NARAL and their allies feel threatened by a bill to protect alive, out-of-the-womb babies. In other words, unlike this legislation, Planned Parenthood and others refuse to draw any line between abortion and infanticide. That is what their lobbying the last week has shown. That should tell us something about what these groups are really about. What they are about is a society built on power--the power of some people to decide whether other people get to live or die.  This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that some lives are less valuable than others. This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that certain human beings should be disposable. This bill is a stumbling block to anyone who thinks that we should be able to quietly rid ourselves of little people who were ``inconvenient'' or supposedly ``unwanted.''  They are not unwanted. There are lots of people in every single State in this Union lined up waiting to adopt, including kids who have lots of hard life circumstances. In every State there are waiting lists of people who will take so-called unwanted babies.  America is a country built on a different principle. Ours is a country dedicated to the proposition that all men and women--all boys and girls--are created equal, even the littlest--even if they happen to come into the world under the most horrible circumstances, even if they are crippled or inconvenient, or, apparently, for a moment, unwanted. Ours is a country that recognizes the fundamental indistinguishable dignity of every human being, regardless of race, or sex, or creed, or ability. As a country, we have struggled for 2 centuries--sometimes at enormous cost--to extend those basic human rights to more and more of our fellow citizens. Today's vote is simply an opportunity to continue that work.  Let me say by way of closing that despite oppositions and setbacks and despite some strange rhetoric about this bill over the course of the last week, I am hopeful in the long term. Deep down, each of us knows that every member of our human family ought to be protected and deserves to be cherished and loved. The love we see every day in the eyes of moms and dads for their newborn babies is an inescapable reminder of that fundamental truth. Love is stronger than power.  Thank you, Madam President."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today, in commemoration of Black History Month, to recognize, honor, and pay tribute to five Pennsylvanians who have committed themselves to creating innovative solutions to our Nation's most pressing problems.  For 13 years, I have stood on this floor on this Monday, every year, to pay tribute to Pennsylvanians. Sometimes it has been one individual, and sometimes it has been more than one, but today we have five honorees.  While these innovators hail from different backgrounds and have each mastered a different craft, they share one thing in common, and that is a commitment to their communities and to improving the lives of others in groundbreaking ways.  Today, we will honor the individual work of the following people. I will list them for you first and then talk about each of them in succession: first, the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake; second, Joan Myers Brown; third, Sulaiman Rahman; fourth, Rakia Reynolds; and fifth, Omar Woodward. You will hear more about each of them in a moment. There is no one way, of course, to make a difference in our society. I hope the stories of today's honorees will help to inspire the next generation of leaders. These honorees are with us here in Washington today, and we are grateful to have the chance to spend a couple of minutes talking about each of them.  Let me start with the Reverend Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake, someone I have known for a long time. This is the story of a woman who has spent her life working to build healthier communities by advancing the conversation on issues like the opioid crisis and health disparities in our Nation, just to mention two things.  Lorina Marshall-Blake's life began in West Philadelphia, alongside her sister and three brothers. She excelled in her education, earning degrees from Antioch College and the University of Pennsylvania.  Today, Lorina is vice president of community affairs for Independence Blue Cross and also president of the Independence Blue Cross Foundation. Lorina has spent the better part of 30 years working to improve access and healthcare outcomes for those across the region of Southeastern Pennsylvania, which is Philadelphia and the counties and communities around the city of Philadelphia. Her faith-driven work continues outside of the office, where she serves as an associate minister at the Vine Memorial Baptist Church.  Lorina is affiliated with over 30 professional and civic organizations. I will just mention a few: The United Negro College Fund, the Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, and the Urban Affairs Coalition. While the health and well-being of our Nation is not perfect, it is in great part thanks to women like Lorina Marshall-Blake that the future of healthcare and the future of access to healthcare is only brighter.  The second individual we are honoring is Joan Myers Brown. We all know that art itself has the power to enrich lives and inspire change. At the age of 17, Joan Myers Brown decided she was going to be a professional ballerina. She refused to let pervasive racism and segregation stop her from touring as a member of dance revues for Cab Calloway, Pearl Bailey, and Sammy Davis, Jr.  After excelling in her own right, she decided she wanted to give opportunity to others. To that end, in 1960, Joan Myers Brown started her own dance school in West Philadelphia called the Philadelphia School of Dance Arts. Building on that work, she founded the Philadelphia Dance Company in 1970. This dance company was created to provide opportunities for Black dancers who were systemically denied entrance to local schools. The company continues to be recognized across the world for its dancers and for its performances.  Personally, Joan is an industry icon in both the national and international art communities. For example, in 2005, the Kennedy Center honored her as a master of African-American choreography, and in 2009, she received the prestigious Philadelphia Award. In 2012, she received the National Medal of the Arts, the Nation's highest civic honor for excellence in the arts. The arts have benefited greatly from Joan Myers Brown.  Third is Sulaiman Rahman. No individual's success is achieved alone. We know that, and many in Philadelphia and beyond owe some of their success to Mr. Rahman. He has dedicated his life to empowering young professionals to personal and professional success.  After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania, Sulaiman started his career as an entrepreneur. He founded a platform for urban professionals to find local social, civic, and business events, and he successfully built an international marketing and distributing business.  With the goal of ending the opportunity gap for people of color, Sulaiman created the Urban Philly Professional Network and, later, DiverseForce, and the DiverseForce on Boards program. Every day he works to empower and connect the diverse leaders from multiple sectors and communities. He creates high-tech solutions to impact a more diverse business culture.  When he is not running DiverseForce, he is serving on a number of boards, including the Community College of Philadelphia Foundation, TeenSHARP, and the Year Up Greater Philadelphia Chapter.  Rakia Reynolds. We know that some of our Nation's greatest successes have been born out of interdisciplinary collaboration. Few in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania know how to bring people together for new opportunities like Rakia Reynolds. From her earliest days as a child reading the book ``A Wrinkle in Time,'' she has always been committed to making things happen.  She is a New Jersey native. She moved to Philadelphia to pursue a degree at Temple University. After working as a television and magazine producer, she started her own company, Skai Blue Media.  Among other ventures, she helped to craft Philadelphia's Amazon bid and continues to advise and grow small businesses of all types. She gives back to her community as the copresident of the Philadelphia chapter of Women in Film & Television and serves as a board advisor for Fashion Group International and the National Association for Multi-Ethnicity in Communications.  In addition to her full-time work in multimedia communications, Rakia is a wife to her best friend, her husband Bram, and mother to her three amazing children.  Finally, our fifth honoree is Omar Woodward. Like many of today's successful leaders, Omar Woodward understands the importance of social enterprises and knows how to look beyond what meets the eye.  Omar is a Southeastern Pennsylvania native. He is the executive director of the Philadelphia branch of the GreenLight Fund, a nonprofit venture capital firm that invests in evidence-based social innovations focused on ending poverty.  At the GreenLight Fund, Omar is investing millions of dollars to address the needs of many Philadelphians, including bringing formerly incarcerated individuals back into the job market, helping low-income children receive quality care, and ensuring that those who were eligible have access to public assistance programs.  Widely recognized for his expertise in nonprofit board governance, Omar is also a board member of the Philanthropy Network Greater Philadelphia, the Global Philadelphia Association, the Maternity Care Coalition, and the Girard College Foundation, and he holds multiple degrees from George Washington University.  In closing, these five individuals have overcome significant barriers to become pioneers in their fields and leaders in their communities. Throughout their careers, these innovators have recognized gaps within communities, developed creative ideas, and brought these ideas to life by using their determination, their passion, and their talent. We celebrate Black History Month to commemorate the great leaders of the past but also to celebrate the leaders of today and the leaders of tomorrow--the future.  It is my honor to recognize and to pay tribute to the Rev. Dr. Lorina Marshall-Blake, Joan Myers Brown, Sulaiman Rahman, Rakia Reynolds, and Omar Woodard for their work in creating a stronger, more innovative Philadelphia. I look forward to the work these leaders will continue to do and the impact their work will have on the city of Philadelphia, our Commonwealth, and our Nation.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise to voice my full support for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, offered by my colleague from Nebraska.  Today's vote on this important bill is going to give every Member of the Senate a chance to show America where one stands on the basic right of care for newborn babies.  Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong supporter of pro-life policies that show compassion to women and children. During my time in the Nebraska Legislature, we passed the first statewide ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks. Members from all points of the political spectrum--Republican, Democratic, pro-life, and pro-choice--came together to support that bill. We have the opportunity today to come together--Republicans and Democrats--to stand up for the lives of newborn infants in the U.S. Senate.  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act protects the lives of children who survive attempted abortions. Simply put, if a baby survives an abortion, he or she deserves the same medical care as any other child who is born prematurely. Without question, newborns deserve care, attention, and love. This should not be a divisive issue. This is an issue that is fundamental to what it means to be an American citizen and, more so, what it means to be a human being. Our Founding Fathers believed, unequivocally, that every person born in the United States has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be, without any doubt, a measure that is passed in the Senate.  Like most Nebraskans, I have been deeply disturbed by the actions in Virginia, New York, and the new extremes that have been pushed in the ensuing national debate that it is OK to deny newborn abortion survivors medical care. As we all know, a bill was introduced in the Virginia House of Delegates that would make it easier to get a third-term abortion. When discussing this legislation, the Governor of Virginia recently made extremely disturbing comments in defending the bill and promoting infanticide when he described the process of an abortion procedure taking place while a mother was in labor. These policies and lines of thought fly in the face of our core values, and they have to end.  In leading up to the vote today, critics across the aisle have mounted a campaign of misinformation to try to knock this bill off course. To be clear, this legislation does not set any limits on the rights of one to obtain an abortion or abortion procedures or methods. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure that if newborns survive abortions, then they would receive the same care and the same attention to their health as would any other newborn. Newborn children should never be treated without basic human rights or the full protection of our laws because they are not wanted, especially when reports have estimated that nearly 2 million couples in the United States are currently waiting to adopt children--2 million.  There is simply no excuse for an infant not to receive lifesaving care. We live in a nation that was founded upon the basic rights of dignity, self-worth, and equality for every human being. In 2002, the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act passed the House of Representatives by a voice vote; it passed the Senate by unanimous consent; and it was signed into law by President Bush. We have the chance right now to build upon that 2002 consensus that those who survive abortions are, in fact, people and to clarify that they deserve medical care. We can come together today to support this sound policy once more. We can clarify, in light of the extremism we have seen displayed recently, that newborn abortion survivors deserve medical care.  I thank my fellow Nebraskan for his good work on this bill, and I will be voting to affirm that children deserve protection at every stage of life.  I ask all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this measure and to vote in favor of this important bill that is before us.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise to join Senator Murray and my colleagues in standing up for doctors and patients in my home State of Minnesota and across the country.  S. 311 puts Congress in the middle of the important medical decisions that patients and doctors should make together without having political interference. It would compel physicians to provide unnecessary medical care. It would override physicians' professional judgments about what is best for their patients, and it would put physicians in the position of facing criminal penalties if their judgments about what is best for their patients are contrary to what is described in this bill.  Colleagues, let me be clear. For women, this is a healthcare issue, not a political issue, and this bill, I fear, interferes with the doctor-patient relationship, which should worry us all. We can all agree that people deserve the best medical care based on their individual needs and their doctors' best medical advice. This is how our medical system is supposed to work--physicians and patients making decisions together that are based on patients' individual needs.  Everybody is different. For example, any oncologist will tell you that each cancer patient's treatment is different. Treatment plans depend on the type of cancer and how advanced the cancer is. Decisions about cancer treatments also depend on each person's age and lifestyle and individual circumstances. The same is true when it comes to pregnancy. Any obstetrician will tell you that every pregnancy is different and that when complications arise, they can completely change the course of treatment. In that moment, women and their families and their doctors are the only ones who are able to make decisions about what is best for a woman and her pregnancy.  Think about what this means in real life. In August of 2016, Tippy, who is from Minnesota and has agreed for me to share her story, was pregnant and, with her husband, went to their 20-week ultrasound appointment. They were excited because they thought they were about to find out the gender of their new baby, and they had already bought decorations for the gender reveal party. Instead, Tippy and her husband got devastating news from that ultrasound. Their baby, a boy, had stopped developing properly and would not survive. They would never get to meet him and never get to hold him. The ultrasound revealed not only the tragic news about this much wanted child but also showed a dangerous condition that threatened Tippy's own health. Tippy's placenta was enlarged, and to continue her pregnancy would risk the health of her reproductive system and her ability to have future children of her own.  Tippy, with her family and her doctor, made the difficult decision to have an abortion in order to save her reproductive system. Because she was able to make that medical decision, she was able to have another baby a year later. Tippy and her husband are today the proud parents of an 18-month-old child. When Tippy and her husband made their decision, it was based on guidance from her doctor and what was right for them and the family they hoped to have in the future.  They didn't need politicians to be looking over their shoulders in the doctor's office and telling them what to do. None of us in this body should be in the business of interfering in that doctor-patient relationship. We don't tell oncologists how to treat their patients; we don't tell emergency room doctors how to save lives; and we shouldn't tell women's doctors how to take care of their patients.  Colleagues, that is what this bill does. It would give politicians in this room the power to make medical decisions for women and their families. This bill intimidates providers and forces physicians to provide inappropriate medical treatment even when it is not in the best interests of their patients or their families.  Colleagues, we should treat women with respect. Decisions about women's healthcare aren't different from decisions about men's healthcare, so why are we treating women differently? This legislation, if it were to become law, would put doctors in an untenable position: Do they follow the law or do they follow their code of professional ethics?  Colleagues, let's get out of the business of dictating medical care for women. Let's continue to trust women and their doctors. I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, this evening, as we debate this very important bill, I am hearing two different strategies, two different discussions, about what is actually on the floor in front of us. You see, my colleagues across the aisle are debating a bill that is not in front of us. They are talking about healthcare for women, which is abortion. That is what they are talking about.  This bill does not address abortion. It does not address women's healthcare issues. What this bill does is address the healthcare of a baby who is born alive after a botched abortion. We are not talking about abortion, folks. We are talking about the life of a child who is born. So, while my colleagues across the aisle are saying this is about abortion, that this is about a mother's healthcare, that is absolutely incorrect. We are talking about a human life.  In recent weeks, we have witnessed the ugly truth about the far-reaching grasp of the abortion industry and its ever-increasingly radicalized political agenda. Some politicians have not only defended aborting a child while a woman is in labor but have gone so far as to support the termination of a child after his birth. This assault on human dignity cannot stand. We can and must do better, and we can as a nation do better to defend and uphold the basic values of compassion and decency that define our very society.  I thank the junior Senator from Nebraska for offering this commonsense legislation that addresses this issue in a compassionate manner and provides critical protections for children who are born alive after surviving abortions. Although previous laws were passed that recognize infants born alive during abortion proceedings as legal persons, there still exists a critical loophole that prevents abortionists from being held accountable for failing to follow these very laws.  This legislation closes the gap and ensures that there are concrete enforcement measures to protect children who survive abortion attempts.  We can all agree that any child who is born alive, whether through a natural birth or a botched abortion, is a living person, a person who is worthy of the utmost dignity, compassion, and respect. This legislation ensures just that by simply requiring healthcare practitioners to treat those babies who survive an abortion attempt with the same degree of care any other baby born at the same gestational age would receive.  This legislation is not meant to punish women or mothers during an often heart-wrenching and difficult experience. In fact, this legislation specifically prohibits mothers from being prosecuted. Instead, this bill quite simply imposes penalties for the intentional killing of a baby who has been born alive.  Today, we have an opportunity to categorically reject infanticide by ensuring that the laws we have on the books preventing this abhorrent practice are meaningfully enforced and that those who fail to follow such laws can be held accountable.  I urge my colleagues to set aside partisanship and support this much needed, compassionate solution. We as a nation can do better. We must protect those babies who are born alive.

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to the legislation that the Presiding Officer has authored. It would significantly interfere with the doctor-patient relationship, and it would pose new obstacles to a woman's constitutionally protected right to make her own decisions about her reproductive health.  Regardless of what the intent of the legislation is, the fact is, the way it is written, it intimidates doctors with the threat of criminal liability for performing safe and legal abortions. It will have a chilling effect on the ability of women to access the services they need in the United States.  We must always remember that abortions that are performed later in pregnancy are most often done as the result of severe fetal diagnoses and the serious risks that pregnancy poses to the life of the mother.  And let's be very clear: This isn't a decision that any women or family wants to be in a position to make. It is tragic and it is heartbreaking, and efforts to politicize the trauma of women and families who have been forced to make this decision are really shameful, and it sets a dangerous precedent for women's comprehensive healthcare.  By installing new uncertainty and risk of criminal liability into the process for late-term abortions, this legislation increases the risk that women will not be able to get the medical care they need when their pregnancy poses a risk to their lives. This bill ignores those important realities in what appears to be an attempt to score political points with anti-choice groups.  Again and again, at every turn, we have seen this administration and our Republican colleagues push forward policies intended to threaten access to abortion care. Just last week, the Trump administration cut off critical family planning resources for family planning clinics that offer information and referrals for women seeking to obtain legal abortions. If you want to prevent abortions, you want to make sure families have access to family planning. We know that is an important way to reduce the number of abortions in this country.  So we are seeing that this bill is just another line of attack in the ongoing war on women's health. Now more than ever, we need to stand up and help protect women's healthcare and make certain that abortions remain safe and legal.  I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation and its consideration on the Senate floor.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I would like to first thank Senator Murray for her steadfast leadership in the fight to protect women's healthcare and for arranging this time for us to speak this afternoon.  The legislation we are debating today is just the latest salvo in the far-right wing assault on a woman's constitutionally protected right to an abortion.  With all due respect to my colleague from Nebraska who introduced this legislation, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. Contrary to what the proponents of this bill argue, it is and has always been a crime to harm or kill newborn babies. People guilty of this crime can already be charged and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Let's be clear. The Senate isn't debating this legislation today because there is an epidemic of infanticide in this country. There is not one. There isn't one. I can hardly say it because it is really not happening; therefore, this bill is a solution in search of a problem. Instead, we are indulging the majority's use of a false premise to inflame the public, shame women, and intimidate healthcare providers.  When you strip away the ultraconservative rhetoric, you are left with a very simple argument from supporters of this legislation--that the moral judgment of rightwing politicians in Washington, DC, should supersede a medical professional's judgment and a woman's decision. Conservative politicians should not be telling doctors how they should care for their patients. Instead, women, in consultation with their families and doctors, are in the best position to determine their best course of care.  In talking to healthcare providers in Hawaii, I have heard how this legislation and other bills like it in States across the country could force them to provide care that is unnecessary or even harmful to patients. The Hawaii Section of the College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists made this point persuasively in testimony recently submitted to our State legislature's house committee on health earlier this month. In opposing similar so-called born-alive abortion legislation heard in Hawaii's State Legislature--which didn't make it out of committee, by the way--the group of doctors wrote: I couldn't agree more, and that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  In just a few minutes, I expect the Senate will defeat this bill because it will fail to win the required 60 votes. Nevertheless, the threat to women's reproductive rights is intensifying in States and courtrooms all across the country. Over the past few years, States have enacted hundreds--hundreds--of laws that harm women's health and violate their constitutional right to an abortion.  Mississippi enacted a prohibition on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy.  Texas, Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Ohio have passed laws banning dilation and evacuation--D&E--an abortion procedure used usually during the second trimester.  Indiana enacted a bevy of new abortion restrictions, including a law requiring every woman seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound--talk about invasive--and mandated she wait 18 hours after the ultrasound to have an abortion.  Louisiana passed legislation requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at local hospitals. This law would result in only one abortion provider in a State of 4.7 million people.  Advocates have recognized the harm these laws would have on women and have filed suits to block their implementation. Several lower courts have ruled these restrictions unconstitutional, and the cases are moving steadily through the courts of appeals en route to the Supreme Court.  The Fifth Circuit, for example, will hear an appeal of a lower court's decision to block Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, as well as an appeal from Texas to allow its ban on D&E procedures to go into effect.  The Seventh Circuit upheld a lower court ruling striking down parts of Indiana's mandatory ultrasound and waiting period law. The Indiana attorney general has requested the Supreme Court to review this case.  The Supreme Court temporarily stopped Louisiana's so-called admitting privileges law from taking effect on a 5-to-4 vote. This is the law I talked about before. This law would result in one abortion provider in a State of 4.7 million people.  The Fifth Circuit will now hear an appeal on the merits of the law, which is virtually identical to a Texas law the Supreme Court struck down in 2016--that was only a few short years ago--in the landmark Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstedt decision.  The stakes in these court battles and the more than 20 other abortion-related cases making their way through the Federal court are incredibly high. Any one of them would provide the opening for the U.S. Supreme Court to finally fulfill the rightwing goal of overturning Roe v. Wade.  It is with this central goal in mind that Donald Trump, Majority Leader McConnell, and complicit Republicans of Congress have been working to pack our Federal courts with ideologically driven judges groomed and handpicked by ultraconservative organizations like the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation.  Donald Trump has already confirmed 85 judges, including 30 to circuit courts and 2 to the U.S. Supreme Court. These judges comprise one-tenth of the Federal judiciary, with many more to come.  In fact, a few weeks ago, the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 42--42--judicial nominees out of committee in one markup. Those 42 comprise an additional 5 percent of the Federal judiciary.  Less than 2 weeks ago, Justice Kavanaugh issued a strong dissent in the earlier mentioned Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to block Louisiana's anti-choice law from taking effect. Using tortured reasoning, Justice Kavanaugh essentially argued that the Supreme Court should disregard its own precedent from only 2 years ago--that is the Whole Women's case I referred to--to allow the Louisiana law to take effect. His dissent signaled his strong antipathy to a woman's right to choose, just as his dissent in Garza v. Hargan did when he was on the DC Circuit. His dissent as a Justice this time demonstrated the emptiness of his promises to uphold Supreme Court precedent during his confirmation hearing.  Justice Kavanaugh's promises then to follow precedent is like that of other Federalist Society-picked Trump nominees now packing our courts, offering little reassurance that nominees in fact will set aside their strongly held ideological views to be objective and fair as judges.  Another case likely to make its way through Federal courts in the months and years ahead is a challenge to the Trump administration's new gag rule. This rule prohibits doctors and other clinicians participating in title X family planning programs from referring patients for, or even speaking about, abortions, even if their patients request such information.  Nearly 20,000 Hawaii residents receive reproductive healthcare through title X. That is roughly the population of the city of Kapolei on Oahu. This attack on title X-funded agencies like Planned Parenthood is an end-run around Congress after Republicans have tried and failed dozens of times to end funding for Planned Parenthood.  Planned Parenthood provides healthcare for millions--millions--of low-income women, men, and young people under title X. Why then do Republicans persist in trying to cut funding for Planned Parenthood?  The constitutional rights of millions of women across the country are under serious and sustained attack, but even in these not normal times, I do see some hope. As State after State passes laws to limit access for a woman's right to choose, communities like Hawaii's are coming together to protect such access.  Last week, I joined activists and staff from Planned Parenthood of the Great Northwest and the Hawaiian Islands as they opened their new medical center and administrative hub in downtown Honolulu. I was particularly energized to see how many young people, women and men, were there and engaged in the fight to protect our right to choice.  I have learned over the years that battles we fought so hard to win never stay won. It is up to all of us to stay engaged and keep fighting for our constitutionally protected rights.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I want to be very clear about the matter that is before the U.S. Senate today. We are not here to debate abortion. That is not what this bill is about that Senator Sasse has introduced. We are here to decide whether it should be legal in the United States of America to kill or neglect an infant who has been born alive after a botched abortion.  This was made very real for me just minutes ago. In fact, Melissa Odom is standing just off the floor of the U.S. Senate, just outside here probably 50 feet from where I am standing. She survived a botched saline-infused abortion in 1977. She was left to die, literally put in the medical waste heap, but thanks to the grace of God and a nurse who saw Melissa, they were able to revive her, and she is a beautiful 41-year-old mom with two children, one being Olivia who was born in the same hospital where the botched abortion took place. She is from Kansas City, married to Ryan.  We are here to vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. By now, we have all heard the disturbing defense of infanticide offered by the disgraced Governor Northam of Virginia. These babies' only crime was to survive the abortionists' attempts to poison, starve, or tear them apart limb from limb while in utero.  What this bill is about is when the abortionist wants to ``finish the job'' as the baby lies helpless on the table of an abortion clinic. Currently, children born alive who survive an abortion attempt are recognized as persons under the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, but that law is merely definitional because not one person to date has been charged or convicted under it. There is no nationwide Federal law criminalizing the actions of killers, like Dr. Kermit Gosnell, who kill or deny care to babies who survive abortions. Current Federal murder statutes have limited jurisdiction, and the States have a patchwork of different laws for born-alive infants.  The bill we are voting on today would give Federal enforcement teeth nationwide to the 2002 Born-Alive law, so that whether an infant is born alive in Montana or in Massachusetts, whether in a hospital or an abortion clinic, they would be guaranteed the same protection and level of care. Is that asking too much?  By contrast, consider that Federal law provides criminal penalties of thousands of dollars in fines and even imprisonment if you ``harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect'' any baby marine turtle, baby bald eagle, or any other baby of an endangered species.  It is absolutely absurd that we are having to decide whether we give human babies the level of protection under Federal law that we give to animals. This is truly an absurd moment on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Have we become so numb as a nation that we cannot realize we are talking about a baby?  Cindy and I became grandparents for the first time on January 23, little Emma Rae Daines, born in Denver. She is now a living, breathing member of the human family. That is what we are talking about here, a living, breathing member of the human family. Is it the position of the Democratic Party that a border wall is immoral but not infanticide?  The phenomenon of infants surviving attempted abortions is very real. These infants are not just statistics. Their lives matter, and their stories deserve to be told, just like the story of Melissa Odom. That is why I am proud of and grateful to my Senate colleague Ben Sasse, who has introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  Infanticide is not and should not be a partisan issue. It is an issue in which there should be no middle ground or compromise. A ``yes'' vote today is to uphold the bare minimum of any civilized society. A ``no'' vote is to deny protection from barbaric violence to the most vulnerable among us, an innocent, little baby.  You can either stand with Governor Northam for infanticide or you can protect the most vulnerable among us.  I yield back my time."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I first thank my colleague from Montana for his powerful message. I can assure him that I believe strongly in the same approach as he does with regard to life.  I rise to discuss an issue of vital importance to our society, and that is the intrinsic value of human life. Very shortly, every Senator will have an opportunity to stand up for human dignity and condemn infanticide when we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This should not be a difficult vote for any of us.  I believe in the value of every innocent human life, beginning at the moment of conception to natural death. Life is a gift from God that should be respected and treated with dignity from the very beginning to the very end.  I have worked to enact pro-life policies throughout my time in public service based upon this principle. While working as Governor, I signed legislation to ban abortions in South Dakota, except when necessary to save a mother's life.  ``Humanae Vitae,'' written by Pope Paul IV and later expanded upon in ``Evangelium Vitae,'' written by Saint Pope John Paul II the Great, teaches that there can be no true democracy without a recognition of the dignity of every person. It goes on to teach that respect and dignity must be given to each human life for true peace and freedom to exist.  We must demand respect for the rights of all. This includes those in the womb, as well as mothers carrying a child who are facing difficult challenges. Both deserve our utmost compassion and care. While this should be common sense to everyone, we recognize that in this country there are individuals who are pro-life and individuals who are pro-choice.  While I and millions of other pro-life Americans continue to work to end all abortions and support measures that strengthen the dignity of life, recent actions at the State level have been deeply troubling. Pro-choice individuals are actually now supporting measures that will allow doctors to commit infanticide even after a baby has been born alive. For example, last month, the State of New York repealed section 4164 of the State's public health law which provided protections for an infant born alive after a failed abortion. Subsequently, in Virginia, legislation has been introduced that would legalize abortion up to term and even after the birth has begun. In Rhode Island, the Governor has vowed to sign legislation legalizing abortion even after the child is viable.  These examples of abortion extremism at its worst--radical, abhorrent acts of infanticide--should horrify all of us. While I am troubled by the thought of any baby being killed at any stage, at a bare minimum every one of us should be able to agree that infanticide--or the killing of a baby after it has been born alive--is unacceptable. This is a separate issue from abortion, which is abhorrent in itself.  In the history of the world, the true test of a society is how well we treat the most vulnerable among us. That is why we must pass this legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, of which I am an original cosponsor, and I would like to thank Senator Sasse for bringing this legislation forward.  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act simply protects newborns who survive abortions by requiring appropriate care and admission to a hospital. When a failed abortion results in the live birth of an infant, our legislation makes clear that healthcare providers must exercise the same degree of professional skill to protect the newborn child as would be offered to any other child born alive at the same gestational age. A baby who survives an abortion deserves the same rights under the law as any other newborn baby and should receive proper medical care, not to be left to die or be killed.  It is also worth mentioning that President Trump stood up for life during the State of the Union Address earlier this month, calling on Congress to pass legislation to prohibit late-term abortions of children who feel pain in the mother's womb. President Trump urged:       Let us work together to build a culture that cherishes      innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: All      children--born and unborn--are made in the holy image of God.  I couldn't agree more. All life is sacred. We must seek to protect and save lives whenever possible, however possible. I urge my colleagues to support the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":" Mr. President, imagine the joy, the emotion, and the anticipation that comes with being in the third trimester of your pregnancy. Imagine choosing the crib and the mobiles that will hang above it. Imagine telling your toddler that he was getting a little sister to play with. Then, imagine the heartbreak of going to the doctor one day and learning that there is no chance your baby will survive, that there is no hope your baby girl will ever speak her first word or take her first step, or that delivering her would put your own life at risk, leaving your firstborn to grow up without a mother. These are the types of scenarios that lead to the heart-wrenching decision to terminate a pregnancy later on.  As the mom of two little girls--one, age 4, and one, 10 months old--I can't begin to fathom that kind of pain. Yet today some on the other side of the aisle are trying to use those parents' suffering for political advantage, making worst-case scenarios like these all the more difficult by pushing a bill aimed to criminalize reproductive care no matter the cost.  If it becomes law, this bill would force doctors to perform ineffective, invasive procedures on fetuses born with fatal abnormalities, even if it is against the best interests of the child, even if it goes against recommended standards of care and they know that it wouldn't extend or improve the baby's life, and even if it would prolong the suffering of the families, forcing women to endure added lasting trauma, making one of the worst moments of their lives somehow even more painful. If physicians refuse, they would be punished and could be sentenced up to 5 years in prison.  We have seen this kind of political stunt before. We know the partisan extremist playbook it comes out of--one based not in fact but in fiction, steeped in ignorance and misogyny. The goal here is obvious: to bully doctors out of giving reproductive care, to scare them out of business--one potential lawsuit or jail sentence at a time--making it even harder for women to get the care they need when they need it most, as the number of physicians available shrinks.  This is just the latest step in the far right's long march to strip away women's rights--a march whose pace has now quickened under our current President, a man who once argued that women should be punished for taking up their right to choose, who has taken pride in trying to put the government between women and their doctors, and who just 72 hours ago issued a gag rule that could gut family planning clinics.  I have said this a thousand times before, and I will keep saying it until I go hoarse: A woman's medical decisions should be between her and her physician and her family and not dictated by some politician in Washington, DC. When lives are on the line, the folks with MDs are the ones who should be deciding what care is appropriate, not those with partisan agendas.  Mothers and doctors know that every pregnancy is different--both of mine certainly were--and physicians are trained with exactly this in mind.  It is offensive and just plain ignorant for my colleagues to claim they know better than a doctor or an expectant mom. It shows an alarming disrespect for a woman's moral compass and her ability to make sound decisions.  I can't begin to conceive of the pain of the mom-to-be who learns that the baby she already loves isn't viable and that the child whose name she has already chosen and whose life she has already imagined will never open their eyes. All this bill would do is to sharpen that family's suffering. All it would do is to make it harder for the next woman to get the care that could save her life. How dare we think of passing legislation like that. How dare we put extremist politics over empathy, over science, and over women's health and families' pain.  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against S. 311--a bill that is as heartless as it is dangerous.  Thank you.  With that, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, it has been interesting to hear the debate today about how heartless it would be to protect the life of a child. The debate from the other side has come out fast and furious, saying that S. 311 is about a child who is not viable and that somehow we are going to put a mom through more torment with a child that is not viable.  The plain text of this bill could not be clearer. This is not about abortion. This is about a child who has been born alive and who is a viable child.  Here is the interesting conversation. Many people in this country argue about abortion--rightfully so. We are talking about the life of a child. This, in particular, though, has a clear argument. What if an abortion is botched, and instead of the child being killed in the womb, they are actually delivered? Now a child is on the table who is crying, with pink skin, 10 fingers and toes wiggling, and is reaching out. What happens now? That is the question with this bill.  Interestingly enough, it is not the first time it has come before the Senate. In 2002, this same issue came before the Senate. The Senate, the House, and the President all agreed that if an abortion was botched and the child was delivered, that child is a child. By definition, that is a child. In 2002, what that bill did not do is define what happens next if the life of that child is then taken after they are born.  This wouldn't be an issue because it is clearly defined in law except for the fact that a few weeks ago, the Governor of Virginia made a public statement saying that we need to have a law to say that we could deliver a child, make it comfortable, and then decide what to do with that baby. Suddenly, this becomes a national conversation.  We thought this was a resolved issue in 2002, but it is not. There is still debate from the other side saying: Deliver the child and then decide what to do with the life of that child.  This is not just an issue that has no consequence as well. After that bill was passed in 2002, the CDC started analyzing birth certificates to determine if this happens and how often it happens.  It doesn't happen often, but in a few number of States where the CDC gathered information from, it determined there were 143 babies who were born alive after an attempted abortion and who then died with no record of how it happened.  Just in 5 months in 2017, the State of Arizona reported that 10 babies were born alive after an attempted abortion. This doesn't happen often, but it does happen, and the question is, Who are we as a nation and what are we going to do with a child who is in front of us who is alive?  Medical professionals are called to do no harm--the Hippocratic Oath. It is interesting to see medical professionals provide care to every person everywhere they go. If there is a car accident, it doesn't matter if it is their patient. They pull over and help. Interestingly enough, at the State of the Union Address, just a couple of weeks ago, we had a staff member in the back who passed out, and Members of Congress who are also physicians, who were in their seats, jumped out of their seats to go provide care because that is what physicians do. But in the case of a botched abortion, the child is delivered and then everyone who is a medical professional just steps back and watches the child die and doesn't provide care. It is the reverse of the Hippocratic Oath. We need to resolve this in our law.  If I can even make a comparison. We as people, and even soldiers in the field, honor life. Soldiers who were trained to take life still are also trained to honor life.  Article 12 of the Geneva Convention, which we support, says this: ``Members of the armed forces and other persons . . . who were wounded, sick . . . shall be respected and protected in all circumstances.'' Literally, if you are in the fight of your life on the field, as our Armed Forces are, and you run across a wounded individual in that fight from the other side, we give care to that person, even though they are our enemy on the battlefield. But in an abortion clinic, that child is not given the same care that we are demanded to give on the battlefield.  This is a fascinating dialogue that I have had with a lot of my colleagues. For a lot of my colleagues who are pro-abortion and who don't see that as a life, I will often ask this simple question: When is a life a life? What is your redline? I think that is a fair conversation.  For myself, it is conception. When that child is conceived and they are developing, they have unique DNA. That is a different person. For others, they will say it is when the child is viable. For others, they will say when the child is born.  I just ask a simple question. When the child is born, is that a child? Is your redline birth? This bill affirms that when a child is born, we should at least acknowledge that that is a person.  I am a dad who has cut the umbilical cord of my own daughter before. I would be terrified to say that the child was not a child until I, as the dad, cut the cord--that I could take that life at any moment before that. That is not who we are as Americans.  Let's pass this. Let's protect living children.  With that, I yield the floor."

This legislation would reduce families' access to reproductive healthcare, interfere in personal medical decisions that should be left between families and doctors, and criminalize doctors and health professionals.  Tonight's vote is part of a broader strategy by this administration and some in Congress to take away women's access to reproductive healthcare, including the constitutional right to an abortion affirmed in Roe v. Wade.  For instance, the administration has already installed two Supreme Court Justices who threaten Roe v. Wade, repeatedly tried to de-fund Planned Parenthood and cut off family planning grants, and given employers the green light to take away birth control coverage from their employees. In the last Congress alone there were 14 anti-women's health votes and 34 anti-women's health bills introduced.  Reproductive health choices are highly personal and deeply sensitive, and they should be left between families and their doctor. S. 311 would effectively overrule these personal decisions by imposing arbitrary standards--based on political ideology, not medical appropriateness--on health professionals.  This bill would effectively criminalize doctors and healthcare clinicians for providing the best plan of care to their patients. It would impose civil and criminal penalties including up to 5 years in prison onto providers if they don't comply with the bill's mandates. These mandates could scare medical professionals away from helping women and families obtain reproductive care, including an abortion, further reducing families' access to care.  More than 17 of the Nation's leading medical, public health, and civil rights organizations oppose this bill. The American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the American Public Health Association state that the bill ``. . . injects politicians into the patient-provider relationship, disregarding providers' training and clinical judgement and undermining their ability to determine the best course of action with their patients.'' The American Civil Liberties Union states that the bill ``. . . shows a callous disregard for patients in need of compassionate, evidence-based care when they face difficult decisions.''  The majority of Americans want more access to reproductive healthcare, not less. More than 7 in 10 Americans do not want women to lose access to safe, legal abortion. In 1991, a majority of voters in the State of Washington passed the Washington Abortion Rights Initiative, declaring that a woman has a right to an abortion.  S. 311 is another misguided attempt to reduce women and families' access to reproductive healthcare. I strongly oppose S. 311 and urge my colleagues to vote no."

                "speech":" Mr. President, I am on the floor to talk about a vote that simply should not have taken place this evening. It was a vote on yet another attack from our Republican colleagues on women's health and their right to access safe, legal abortions--this time in the form of an anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family piece of legislation that medical experts strongly oppose. Republicans have spread a lot of misinformation about this bill, so let's be clear what it is not about and what it is actually about.  This bill is not about protecting infants, as Republicans have claimed, because that is not up for debate, and it is already the law. This bill is also not at all about ensuring that appropriate medical care is delivered, because it would make it harder for healthcare providers to provide high-quality medical care that their patients need and deserve.  The leading nonpartisan organization of OB/GYNs in our country has said this bill should never become law. It calls it ``gross legislative interference into the practice of medicine'' and ``part of a larger attempt to deny women access to safe, legal, evidence-based abortion care.'' In fact, 17 top health and medical organizations wrote to Congress to insist that Democrats and Republicans vote this bill down.  Since this bill is not about infants or appropriate medical care, I am sure many people are wondering what exactly it is about. What would this bill really mean for women and families and healthcare providers?  If you are a woman, this bill would mean, if you were one of the very, very few women who needed an abortion late in your pregnancy, you could be legally required to accept inappropriate, medically unnecessary care--care that may directly conflict with your wishes at a deeply personal, often incredibly painful moment in your life--because politicians in Washington decided their beliefs mattered more than yours.  If you are a medical provider, this bill would supersede your years of medical training and your oath to deliver the best possible medical treatment to your patients. It would apply a one-size-fits-all set of requirements that does not reflect the reality that every pregnancy is different, and it would subject you to criminal penalties if you were to choose to let medical standards, not politics, drive the care you offer to your patients.  For families who struggle with the painful reality that the children they had hoped for could not survive, as is tragically the case in many of the cases we are discussing, this legislation would take precedence over families' wishes as they grieve.  This bill is government interference in women's healthcare, in families' lives, and in medicine on steroids. As I said, it is anti-doctor, anti-woman, and anti-family. It has no place in becoming law. Its proponents claim it would make something illegal that is already illegal. So why are we debating this legislation that would take women backward when there are so many ways we should be advancing medicine, improving women's healthcare, and supporting families? As far as I can tell, it is because this bill is about something that Republicans care about more than almost any other priority; that, unfortunately, is the rolling back of women's constitutionally protected rights and trying to take us back in time before the Roe v. Wade decision.  Since day No. 1 of the Trump-Pence administration, this party has pulled every possible stop to appeal to its extreme anti-abortion base. Just last week, the Trump-Pence administration put forward a rule that would prevent healthcare providers at clinics that are funded through the title X family planning program from so much as informing patients about where to get an abortion even if that patient directly asks them for advice. This rule means trusted medical providers across the country may not be able to serve women and men who rely on them for contraception, cancer screenings, and more--all because Republicans are determined to make abortion impossible in the United States. That is just one of many examples.  To recap, this bill is completely unnecessary. It is harmful to women and families, and it would criminalize doctors. It is intended to do nothing except to help Republicans advance their goal of denying women their constitutionally protected rights. I am against it in the strongest terms. Everybody who cares about women, families, and doctors and about upholding the Constitution should be too, so I am glad the Senate voted tonight to stop this anti-doctor, anti-woman, anti-family bill from going a single step further.  The next time Republicans want to have a conversation about protecting infants and children, I am happy to talk about the babies and children who have been separated from their parents at the border or about improving access to early childhood education or about making sure coverage for maternal healthcare and preexisting conditions is not taken away. These are problems that do exist and that do need to be solved, and we are just as ready and willing to work on those as we are to stand up and say ``absolutely not'' to this harmful bill."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in the very near future, my Senate colleagues will be asked to take an unprecedented vote--a vote that never should have been scheduled here in the first place.  Republican leaders are demanding that we move ahead and vote on President Trump's nominee to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court despite the fact that I and my colleague Senator Cantwell have not returned our blue slips on behalf of our constituents in Washington State and despite the fact that the hearing for the nominee was a total sham. This is wrong, and it is a dangerous road for the Senate to go down. Not only did Republicans schedule this nominee's confirmation hearing during a recess period when just two Senators--both Republicans--were able to attend, but the hearing included less than 5 minutes of questioning--less questioning for a lifetime appointment than most students face for a book report in school.  Confirming this Ninth Circuit Court nominee without the consent or true input of both home State Senators and after a sham hearing would be a dangerous first for this Senate.  This is not a partisan issue. This is a question of the Senate's ability and commitment to properly review nominees. Yet, here we are on the Senate floor, barreling toward a vote to confirm a flawed nominee, who came to us following a flawed nomination process--all because a handful of my Republican colleagues will apparently stop at nothing to jam President Trump's extreme conservatives onto our courts, even if that means trampling all over precedent, all over process, or any semblance of our institutional norms.  Maybe Republican leaders are hoping most Americans aren't paying attention to what is happening right now in the Senate--that somehow tossing out Senate norms in order to move our country's courts to the far right will go unnoticed.  Well, I am standing here right now to make sure everyone knows because I, for one, fear the short- and long-term consequences of letting any President steamroll the Senate on something as critical as our judicial nominees--the very men and women who are tasked with interpreting our Nation's laws and making sure they serve justice for all Americans.  I fear the consequences of abandoning the blue-slip process and, instead, bending to the will of a President who has demonstrated time and again his ignorance and disdain for the Constitution and the rule of law.  At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing the limits of law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United States to a family separation policy at our southern border--it is very important, more than ever, that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on the bench.  Let's be very clear. Trump cannot steamroll the Senate by himself. But in the Republican leadership, he has found Members willing to throw out every rule, every tradition, every safeguard in the book to give him what he wants.  So this vote, which is happening soon, and this new precedent of turning a blind eye to the blue slip should stop every one of my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats--in their tracks because, today, the two home Senators still holding their blue slips are my colleague Senator Cantwell and me, but in the future, it could be any Member of this body.  I am doing this for very good reasons--reasons very much in line with why the blue-slip process exists in the first place. I am doing this because I don't believe Mr. Miller has received the necessary scrutiny and vetting to serve on the bench--a lifetime appointment. I believe the people I represent would not want him there, plain and simple.  I want to briefly go into one area that causes particular and very serious concern, and that is what I have heard from my constituents about Mr. Miller's misunderstanding of Tribal sovereignty and his ability to be impartial and fair-minded when hearing cases involving Tribal rights.  As one Tribal leader from my home State put it, Mr. Miller has built a career out of mounting challenges against Tribes, including their sovereignty, their lands, their religious freedom, and even the core attributes of Federal recognition.  I want to be very clear because I do not believe that it is wise for Senators to support or oppose nominees only because of their past clients. Our legal system requires talented lawyers on both sides of every case, and sometimes lawyers represent clients who are politically unpopular.  But making a career decision to be one of the top attorneys, in case after case, attacking Tribal sovereignty--that is more than a choice of a client. That is a choice about values, and it is something my colleagues should consider.  There are more than 400 federally recognized Tribes in the Western United States, including Alaska. Every single one could find themselves before the Ninth Circuit and before a judge who spent years fighting for an extreme position directly opposed to their own sovereignty and whose advocacy repeatedly attempted to undermine the rights of Tribal nations everywhere. Particularly at a time when the Supreme Court may demolish important protections for subsistence rights, a circuit nominee opposed to Tribal sovereignty should not be confirmed.  This is a serious matter worthy of true examination. Yet Mr. Miller's nomination process was inadequate from the start.  Today it is Washington State families who are getting cut out from this important process. Tomorrow, it can be the concerns of any of your constituents and any of your home States that get tossed aside for a President's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy a political base--and Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for our norms and our precedents and our constitutional duty.  I urge my colleagues to truly think about what moving ahead with this nomination means and to ask themselves: Are we still able to work together in a bipartisan way and find common ground for the good of the country and the people we serve? Can we still engage in a bipartisan process to find consensus candidates to serve on our courts? Or will our work here in the U.S. Senate be reduced to partisan extremes and political gamesmanship?  Will Republicans accept simply being a rubberstamp for their leader in the White House, and will my colleagues be complicit in allowing our courts to be taken over by ideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a commitment to justice for all?  That is the choice every Senator will make with this vote, and I sincerely hope a choice for which every Senator will be held accountable.  To vote yes will be a vote in favor of further eroding the Senate's commitment to examining nominees for lifetime appointments and its ability to serve as a check on the Executive. To vote yes is to toss away each Senator's ability to provide guidance on judicial nominees for their State and the families they represent.  To vote no will be a vote to stand up for the Senate's role in our democracy and to stand up for a process that helps the Senate ensure qualified judges who play such a critically important role in our democracy. To me, the choice is pretty clear.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to join many of my colleagues in raising our voices on behalf of some of the most vulnerable members of our society.  Recently, a very disturbing and revealing discussion has been taking place in our country that raises serious questions about how much value and worth we ascribe to babies in the womb, especially those who are born despite an attempted abortion procedure.  Before I go any further, let me say this clearly and unequivocally: If we as a nation are to hold any claim to a moral character that deserves to be admired and emulated, then we must be willing to say that the lives of newborn children have inherent value and are worthy of protection. There is simply no way to credibly claim otherwise.  Whether it be legislation introduced or enacted by State legislatures or comments made by public officials, such as the Governor of Virginia, our country has begun to entertain the idea that the rights and privileges newborn babies possess is an open-ended question.  This is alarming, and the U.S. Senate should go on the record in defense of their right to live instead of being callously discarded or worse--intentionally killed in the name of reproductive freedom. There is no middle ground here.  It is concerning to me that in some corners of this country, and even within this Congress, there is an utter failure to recognize and affirm the right to life, especially after an infant has already been born.  Throughout my time in elected office, I have found that giving those who disagree with me on any given issue the benefit of the doubt as it relates to their motivations has allowed me to consistently find commonality and reach compromise, even with incredibly unlikely allies and partners. But in this instance, there can be no mistake or ambiguity. The common ground that we all must occupy should be a shared commitment to uphold the basic, fundamental right to protect the life of every child, no matter the circumstances of his or her birth, which brings me to the legislation before the Senate today.  I am a cosponsor of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and I am grateful to each of my colleagues who supported the bill tonight. This legislation would create criminal penalties for doctors who allow infants to die rather than provide medical care after an attempted abortion.  It would also require that born-alive abortion survivors be transported to a hospital for care and treatment rather than being left to languish on the counter of an abortion clinic or--as one former nurse and pro-life activist has shockingly recounted--be discarded along with the biohazard materials.  Even in situations where comfort care is rendered to these little ones, that sometimes amounts to nothing more than keeping a baby warm until it passes away alone. No child should suffer this way.  Under this bill, abortionists who defy these mandates to render care to born-alive survivors would face the justice that they are due instead of being ignored or permitted to continue committing infanticide.  It is time for our country to demand that the victims of this abhorrent, inhumane treatment be afforded their rights and the perpetrators be held accountable.  Speaking with one clear voice, we must say that every human being is made in the image of God and is therefore in possession of dignity and worth that cannot be displaced or dispossessed. Anything short of this unambiguous declaration would be a tremendous disservice to our children and fatally undermine the values of our society that we claim to uphold. While the debate surrounding abortion has engulfed this country for decades, the goalposts are now being shifted. Reproductive autonomy, we are now told, must include the ability and choice to end the life of a baby who survives an attempted abortion.  As a former medical provider, I believe that to end a newborn's life either by refusing to provide lifesaving care or actively taking that child's life--as in the case of the infamous abortionist Dr. Kermit Gosnell and others--violates the oath every medical provider takes to do no harm.  As a dad and a grandfather, I know from my own experience just how precious each life is. My daughters and grandchildren are treasured gifts that bring my family and me immeasurable joy. To think that they or any other child might be treated with anything other than the dignity and respect they are entitled to is tragic, heartbreaking, and outrageous.  Providing necessary medical attention to save the lives of infants who survive an abortion is an imperative that we as a society must embrace if we are to be faithful to the promise our Founders made to the generations of Americans who would succeed them. In declaring the self-evident truth that all men are created equal, surely they intended to extend the same rights and liberties that their countrymen fought and died for to newborn babies who survive abortions.  I am proud to have stood with my colleagues today in support of this legislation that seeks to protect these precious, vulnerable lives. We can and should do this as a reflection of the country we want to be.  Our abortion laws in the United States already situate us among some of the world's worst human rights abusers, including North Korea and China.  Now a national conversation about whether to provide children who survive abortions medical attention and care has ensued. It is my hope and prayer that the final word in this discussion will end with a resounding commitment to protect and preserve life.  I would like to thank the junior Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Sasse, for leading on this critical issue and pushing to bring this measure to the floor today.  I would also like to thank the President for his vocal commitment to defending life and protecting the most vulnerable among us.  I feel blessed to stand alongside so many others to raise our voices on behalf of the voiceless.  While I am disappointed with the result of today's vote, I remain committed to fighting for those who are unable to fight for themselves and will continue working to protect and uphold the sanctity of life.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I want to offer some thoughts regarding the ongoing negotiations with North Korea that began with the Singapore summit between President Trump and Kim Jong Un and will continue in a few days when the two leaders meet again in Vietnam.  I join the chorus of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have expressed concern regarding the outcome of the last summit and the subsequent negotiations. This is not meant as a criticism of the diplomatic process itself. Clearly, we are in a much better place now than 2 years ago, when the President was promising fire and fury for the Korean Peninsula, terrifying our South Korean allies, who stand to lose millions of their citizens in any confrontation with North Korea. Furthermore, if the Singapore summit had resulted in a clear path toward denuclearization, I would be standing here right now commending these diplomatic efforts.  The maximum pressure campaign, significantly enhanced by this body's sanctions regime and the United Nations Security Council's resolutions, brought North Korea to the negotiating table. It was a golden opportunity and, unfortunately, it was squandered by this ill-prepared administration, which seems more concerned with photo ops than with the substance of the negotiation.  The Singapore summit was a loss for the United States and our alliances and a great publicity win for North Korea. The 2005 six-party joint statement contained significantly more commitments from North Korea than the joint statement of the Singapore summit. Given President Trump's bluster and renouncement of the JCPOA, one would have thought that he would leave Singapore with an ironclad commitment and schedule for denuclearization. Instead, he got less than in any past negotiation with North Korea.  Most concerning to me is that without obtaining a single concrete concession from North Korea, President Trump undermined our alliance with the Republic of Korea by characterizing our joint exercises as provocative war games. It was a huge propaganda win for North Korea and a huge loss to the United States and to the readiness of the joint force. The regularly scheduled exercises are very important to troop readiness and our regional security. While I understand the need to create diplomatic space for these negotiations to proceed, we must ensure that we do not sacrifice readiness for empty promises.  While I am pleased with the agreement on the return of prisoners of war and missing-in-action personnel remains, which rightfully continue to be important issues for U.S. families, the Singapore summit was mostly pomp and circumstance that did not advance our national security interests. In fact, it could be said that we are in a worse position than we were before the summit. President Trump undeservedly transformed Kim Jong Un from a ruthless dictator to a world statesman in short order. He has since used his stature from the summit to make closed-door deals with China and Russia that will be used as leverage against the United States.  The President also conferred legitimacy on a corrupt and morally bankrupt dictator who has imprisoned hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children in political camps under brutal conditions and has committed horrendous crimes against his neighbors and own people. Human rights did not play a prominent role at the summit, and the joint declaration does not include one single reference. If we want to continue to serve as a beacon for human rights, this issue will have to be on the agenda for these negotiations. There are a number of U.S. sanctions against North Korea because of its human rights record, and this body will not loosen those sanctions until and unless we see progress on the issue. As such, I was dismayed that the President in his State of the Union Address did not call out the North Korean regime's callous disregard for human rights.  Since the summit, we have seen just how problematic the joint declaration has been as a foundational document for the negotiations. While Secretary Pompeo characterized the first meeting with North Korean negotiators at the summit as ``productive,'' the North Koreans criticized Secretary Pompeo's gangster-like demand for denuclearization. The chasm between the two sides was created by the ambiguity of the summit itself and its failure to create an agreed-upon path for both parties. We have not seen a substantial dismantlement of nuclear or missile sites over the last year, and independent news reporting reflects that North Korea continues to develop its nuclear and missile arsenals despite the self-imposed ban on testing.  What should we have gotten from the summit? Since we played our biggest card and gave Kim Jong Un a meeting with the President of the United States, the answer is a lot more than what we did get. First and foremost, we should have gotten a joint declaration that North Korea agrees to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization. If we were not going to get that commitment, then we should have at least gotten a specific commitment similar to the September 19, 2005, joint statement, where North Korea committed to ``abandoning all nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs and returning at an early date to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and to IAEA safeguards.'' Instead, we got a vague statement that North Korea will ``work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.'' Despite the administration's protestations to the contrary, it is not at all clear that North Korea actually agreed to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization, generally referred to as CVID. I am concerned, as are others, that the words ``complete denuclearization'' were used because the North Koreans would not agree to CVID. If that is the case, then, we are starting in a worse place than we were during the 2005 talks.  Why do these words matter? They matter because of the historical context of these negotiations. Without the word ``verifiable,'' North Korea has not agreed to inspections, and, without inspections, we cannot be sure that North Korea will take the steps necessary to denuclearize. The regime does not have a good track record of living up to its agreements. Without a verification process that includes a robust inspection and verification regime, we will never be sure that North Korea is not reverting to its past tactics and cheating on its commitments.  Even more alarming to those who follow past negotiations is that the commitment that did come out of the summit sounds suspiciously like the tack North Korea has taken in past negotiations--that denuclearization of the peninsula will require the United States to remove its nuclear umbrella from its ally, the Republic of Korea, and remove its troops from the peninsula. North Korea has peddled this tit-for-tat denuclearization narrative for years, and this administration must ensure that it does not become the narrative of the upcoming negotiations. These competing narratives should have been reconciled at the summit by the leaders but instead were left for future negotiations.  The administration now has another opportunity in Vietnam to establish some credibility for these negotiations and demand a set of concrete deliverables. We should all recognize that CVID will take years to accomplish. Despite President Trump's patently false claim that he has solved the North Korean nuclear threat, that threat is still very real and very dangerous. There are commitments that we need from the other side to gauge whether North Korea is sincere in its intent to denuclearize. We already know that the intelligence community has made the determination that North Korea does not intend to denuclearize. Therefore, the concessions we seek from North Korea need to include a verification and inspection scheme that includes a reasonable timeline and is comprehensive enough to include all of its weapons of mass destruction programs and facilities and focuses on engagement instead of punishment. We should not use inspections as ``aha'' moments to catch the North Koreans in intentional or unintentional mistakes. Instead, they should be used as the foundation to develop a comprehensive picture of all of North Korea's weapons programs and as the basis for future negotiations.  What would a successful summit in Vietnam look like? We need a declaration from North Korea of all of its nuclear weapons and programs and facilities. Ideally, it would also include a catalog of all of its missiles and missile facilities. This declaration of all of its sites and programs needs to be provided to the United States in short order to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency, or the IAEA, inspectors to start the inspections process, which will take years.  Second, we need North Korea to agree to verifiable denuclearization with IAEA inspections, and that agreement should include a concrete timeline with a step-by-step process. If we are going to continue to scope down our joint exercises for the sake of these negotiations, then, we need to see concrete actions by North Korea in the next few months. It has been almost a year since the last summit, and we have not seen any concrete irreversible actions taken by North Korea on its nuclear program that signify an intent by the regime to give up or significantly curtail its programs.  I wanted to speak on this issue today before the second summit because I am concerned that the President will fall prey to North Korean manipulation and accept an agreement that does not include significant concessions by the regime. Kim Jong Un's ploy is to make commitments for the future that can easily be forgotten or to offer up facilities or sites that are obsolete.  For example, if the President gets assurances for the dismantling of the Sohae launch facility and the closure and inspections of the Yongbyon nuclear facility, he may think that North Korea has moved the needle on denuclearization, but as the experts will tell you, the real jewels are other nuclear sites that are more critical for the regime's programs. As recent reports by the Center for Strategic and International Studies have shown, there are many missile sites that have not been declared and that are critical to the nuclear program. This is why a full declaration is so critical--so that we finally have a comprehensive accounting of the nuclear and missile programs that exist.  In the meantime, the administration also needs to be vigilant that China and other countries continue to enforce sanctions. President Trump's assertions that the problem is solved will significantly undercut our ability to keep the pressure on. We need consistent messaging from the White House and the rest of the administration that the Singapore summit was the first step, and until we see concrete results, there will be no abeyance of the sanctions regime. Keeping China in line on that front will be a significant challenge, especially given the isolationist bent of this President, who has managed to alienate the very partners we need to cooperate on the sanctions regime.  China does not need to state publicly that it will stop enforcing sanctions. Even low-level cross-border trade can allow the North Korean economy to hobble along for years, and all it will take is an indication from Beijing that sanctions enforcement is no longer a priority.  Let me be clear. One of the most important outcomes of this process is also the preservation of our alliances with South Korea and Japan. Even if we were to somehow achieve a CVID deal with North Korea but lose our special relationships with these two nations, we will come out the other side less secure than we are today. While North Korea poses a significant threat to the United States, peace on the peninsula cannot come at the cost of a diminished U.S. presence in Asia. Our alliances and partners in the region are the bulwark of our strength in the region.  Both South Korea and Japan have significant national security interests that will be adjudicated during these negotiations. Neither is at the negotiating table. I am very concerned that Japan in particular is dismayed that there has not been any substantive progress in the negotiations. It is critical that the administration continue to raise issues that are critical to Japan, especially the Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea. It is up to this administration to ensure that their interests are voiced and that their security needs are met. That means not only addressing North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile program but also its short- and intermediate-range missiles. It means consulting with our allies before significant decisions that affect their security are taken, and it means not publicly lamenting about the costs associated with these historic and strategic alliances. We cannot simply put a price tag on our regional security. Losing these alliances will cost us far more in the long run and leave us far less secure than we are today.  We also need to be concerned about the recent deterioration of the relationship between our two critical allies. Trilateral cooperation is only effective if South Korea and Japan can overcome their historical animosities to present a united front against North Korea.  I know there is a lot of discussion today about the possibility of a peace agreement to end the 65-year-old armistice. I fear that many see a peace agreement as the precursor for a removal of U.S. forces from the Korean Peninsula. I am concerned that our President does not understand the critical importance of the deployment of U.S. Forces Korea on the peninsula.  Let me be clear. The withdrawal of troops from the peninsula would significantly undermine our ability to fulfill our treaty obligations to South Korea. It should not be a subject of these negotiations or any future negotiations with North Korea. The presence of our troops is the cornerstone of our military alliance with South Korea, and they must remain present and ready to ``Fight Tonight'' for the benefit of the alliance and regional security.  Looming over all of this is our long-term strategic competition with China. I find it telling that China was one of the first countries to announce the cancellation of our joint exercises with the Republic of Korea.  What are China's ambitions for this negotiation process? While China is certainly concerned about the nuclear arsenal its southern neighbor has amassed, denuclearization may not be China's highest national security concern during these negotiations. In the long run, China recognizes that its near-peer competition with the United States complicates its interests in these negotiations. China's highest priority is likely to ensure that it does not end up with a U.S.-allied reunified Korea on its southern border. Another goal is driving a wedge between the United States and its allies in order to promote itself as a regional hegemon.  We all recognize that Russia has similar ambitions--separate us from our allies, establish themselves as regional hegemons, and coerce and bully their smaller neighbors on issues of defense, trade, and economics. We cannot allow that to happen.  We already see attempts by China to relax sanctions enforcement. This trade spat is just one of the wedges North Korea will be able to leverage between China and the United States. We need a coordinated strategy that keeps our long-term interests in Asia focused while resolving the North Korean crisis. To date, we have not seen any indication that such a strategy exists.  Peace on the Korean Peninsula has eluded us for decades. There is an opportunity now to force Kim Jong Un's hand, through skillful negotiation and a coordinated sanctions regime, to take concrete steps toward denuclearization.  I hope this administration will use the Vietnam summit to negotiate a substantive agreement that keeps America and its allies safe, strong, and secure.  With that, I yield the floor."

                "topic":"Abortion",
                "speech":"Mr. President, I am here to take the opportunity to join my colleagues to speak in support of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I thank Senator Sasse for his continued leadership on this issue. I supported the bill when Senator Sasse introduced it last Congress, and I was glad to see Senator McConnell, our leader, bring this bill to the floor for a vote.  I am astonished--astonished--that we are debating whether it is appropriate to leave born children to die. Today, now, in the year of 2019, how can this be? Science demonstrates that human life begins at conception, and our understanding of neonatal development is increasing every day.  I am a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services. The National Institutes of Health is one of my top priorities for funding. At the NIH, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has advanced our knowledge of pregnancy and development in the womb. Under this Institute, the Neonatal Research Network has pioneered research that has led to techniques that saved the lives of children in their earliest stages, when these children are at their most vulnerable.  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that more than 10,000 babies are aborted each year after 20 weeks of conception, when science--science--tells us that an unborn child can feel pain inside the womb. That number will increase as a result of recent State-level efforts to end virtually any restriction on abortion when a child could viably live outside the womb. These efforts are extreme and fall far beyond the mainstream of American opinion.  This legislation does nothing to limit prenatal abortion. While we must address that issue--the root causes of abortion and the ways to curb this heartbreaking trend--that is not the issue at hand today in this legislation. The question before us is this: When a child survives an abortion and is born, does the U.S. Senate believe the child can still be eliminated, or should the baby be protected and given all possible care to survive? This act requires healthcare practitioners to ``exercise the same degree of professional skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of a child as a reasonably diligent and conscientious healthcare practitioner would render to any other child born alive at the same gestational age.'' Any negligence in this regard is subject to criminal and civil punishment, which at present does not exist.  Should anyone think this is some made-up issue--despite the Virginia Governor's shocking comments revealing an openness to infanticide and New York's expansion of abortion well beyond the age of viability that makes born-alive abortion survivors more likely--we have concrete evidence that this grotesque act happens. Notorious abortion provider Kermit Gosnell is serving life in prison for these very acts.  Closing our eyes to what is obscene does not make it any less real. That it is allegedly ``rare'' doesn't make it any less real or abhorrent. One child purposefully deprived of healthcare and allowed to die is one too many. It is infanticide, which brings us to the crux of this issue. We need to think carefully about the long-term impacts to the definition of ``healthcare'' if Congress refuses to act positively on this measure. Do the guardrails of neonatal health succumb to the belief that infants don't really count as one of us?  Our society is not one of the ancient Romans or the Aztecs. We don't sacrifice our children to please an unknown god. In the progress of human history, principles of the enlightenment--also known as the Age of Reason--declared self-evident truths that all humans are created equal and endowed with the unalienable right to life. Although undoubtedly we have our flaws, these enlightenment principles enshrined in our founding documents remain true to who we are as a nation and who we are as human beings. We recoil when we hear of children who are harmed in any manner. Yet today we are faced with a reality where the ability to terminate an unborn child's life when it is viable outside of the womb is something that is not only tolerated but is passionately defended by the left.  That is bad enough, but to see legislation ensuring that the medical care of born children gets blocked is incomprehensible. The immutable march of progress in human history has met a roadblock today in the U.S. Senate. The Age of Reason seems to have escaped us.  Tonight, the Senate had an opportunity to send a message showing who we are as leaders and as a society as a whole--one that protects the weak and the voiceless instead of one that permits their destruction. I regret and I am saddened that the Senate failed this fundamental test.  I am eager to do more to protect innocent life, including the unborn, but the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Act provided us an opportunity to affirm the most basic need for healthcare for a vulnerable child who has already beaten the odds to survive. Let's hope we have another opportunity to give these children the chance at life they so deserve.  I thank you.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, this week, the Senate may see an extreme example of how the minority can abuse its rights in a way that provokes the majority into an excessive use of its power. I come to the floor to offer my Democratic colleagues a way to avoid both mistakes.  Here is the abuse of minority rights: More than a year ago, President Trump nominated John Ryder of Memphis to serve on the board of directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority based on the recommendation that Senator Bob Corker and I made. Finally, this week, the Senate is likely to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination.  You might say: Well, there must really be something wrong with Mr. Ryder.  Well, if there is, then all the people who are supposed to find out what is wrong with Mr. Ryder have not found it out. Senator Corker and I know him very well as one of Tennessee's finest attorneys. Senator Blackburn agrees. After a hearing at which Mr. Ryder answered questions, Republican and Democratic members of the Environment and Public Works Committee unanimously approved his nomination. No, there is no problem with Mr. Ryder.  You might say: This must be a position of overwhelming complexity and importance that requires a year for all of us to think about it.  TVA is the Nation's largest public utility, and it is important to the millions of us in the seven-State region for whom it provides electricity. But this is not a lifetime appointment. It is not a Cabinet position. It is not even a full-time position. This is one of nine part-time board positions whose nominees are usually approved in the Senate by a voice vote.  The problem is not with Mr. Ryder. It is not because of the unusual importance of the position. The problem is with the determination of the Democratic minority to make it nearly impossible for President Trump to fill the 1,200 Federal Government positions that require confirmation by the U.S. Senate as part of our constitutional duty to provide advice and consent.  This is where we are: Democrats have objected to the majority leader's request to vote on Mr. Ryder's nomination. As I mentioned, these are nominations normally approved by a voice vote. So in order to have a vote, the majority leader, Senator McConnell, has filed a cloture petition to cut off debate on Mr. Ryder's nomination.  The cloture process takes at least 3 days. Here is how it works: The first day, you file cloture. That is what Senator McConnell did. The second day is a so-called intervening day when no action can be taken, so nothing is happening. On the third day, the Senate votes to invoke cloture, and then there is up to 30 more hours for postcloture debate before the Senate can finally vote on whether to confirm Mr. Ryder.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder is not the only victim of such obstructionism. During the last 2 years, Democrats have done what I just described 128 times. One hundred and twenty-eight times they have required the majority leader to consume up to 3 days to force a vote on a Presidential nominee. By comparison, requiring a cloture vote to advance a nomination happened 12 times during the first 2 years of President Obama's term, compared to President Trump's 128 times; 4 times during the first 2 years of George W. Bush's term, compared to President Trump's 128 times; 12 times during Bill Clinton's first 2 years, compared to President Trump's 128 times. Not once during George H. W. Bush's first 2 years in office was it necessary for the majority leader to file cloture to cut off debate to advance a Presidential nomination--not once--but it had to be done 128 times in the first 2 years of President Trump's time.  This unnecessary obstruction has to change. The result of this extraordinary delay in considering nominees creates a government filled with acting appointees who, never having gone through the Senate confirmation process, are less accountable to Congress and therefore less accountable to the American people. So at a time when many complain that the Executive has become too powerful, the Senate is deliberately making itself weaker by diminishing our constitutional duty to advise and consent to individuals nominated to fill important positions--perhaps the Senate's best known role.  This abuse of power by the minority is about to produce an excessive reaction by the majority--something that I think at least nine Democratic Senators who can see 2 years ahead would want to avoid. At least nine Democratic Senators hope to be the next President of the United States. Do they not know that some Republicans will do to the next Democratic President's nominees what Democrats have done to President Trump's nominees? Let me ask that again. Do the nine Democratic Senators who want to be the next President of the United States--that election is about 20 months away--not know that if they are elected, some Republicans will do to them what Democrats have done to President Trump's nominees?  The Senate is a body of precedent. What goes around comes around. All it takes will be one Republican Senator objecting to a unanimous consent request to make it difficult for the next Democratic President to form a government, and this will continue the diminishment of the U.S. Senate.  Can Republican Senators, by majority vote, change Senate rules to stop this obstruction? Yes, we can, and we will, if necessary. There are several ways to change the rules of the Senate. We can amend the standing rules of the Senate. We can adopt a standing order. We can pass a law. We can set a new precedent. We can change the rules by unanimous consent. All of these are rules of the Senate.  The written rules of the Senate say it requires 67 votes to amend a standing rule and 60 votes to amend a standing order. There is recent precedent to change the Senate rules by a majority vote.  In 2013, the Democratic leader, Harry Reid, used a procedural maneuver--let's call it the Harry Reid precedent--that allowed the Democratic Senate majority to overrule the Chair and say, in effect, that a written Senate rule does not mean what its words say.  Now, this is as if a referee in a football game were to say the following: The rule book says that a first down is 10 yards, but I am the referee, and I am ruling that a first down is 9 yards.  Well, that is what happened in 2013. So, in 2017, what goes around comes around. The Republican majority followed this Harry Reid precedent in order to make cloture on all nominations a majority vote, and now Republicans are on the verge again of following the Harry Reid precedent.  Should Republicans do this, change a rule by majority vote, even though our written rules say it should be done by 60 or 67 votes? The answer is, no, we shouldn't, not if we can avoid it.  As Senator Carl Levin said in 2013, when he opposed the Harry Reid precedent--Senator Levin is a Democrat, and he said: A Senate in which a majority can change its rule at any time is a Senate without any rules.  Thomas Jefferson, who wrote our first rules, said: It didn't make much difference what the rules are. It just matters that there are some rules.  So it is at least awkward for Members of the country's chief rule-writing body, the U.S. Senate, to expect Americans to follow the rules we write for them when we don't follow our own written rules.  I have heard many Democrats privately say to me, they express their regret that they ever established the Harry Reid precedent in 2013. They didn't look ahead and see that what goes around comes around and that this is a body of precedent.  So what would be the right thing for us to do--something that avoided both the minority's abuse of its rights and the majority's excessive response. We should do what the Senate did in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013, when Republicans and Democrats worked together to make it easier for President Obama and his successors to gain confirmation of Presidential nominees.  As a Republican Senator, I spent dozens of hours on this bipartisan project to make it easier for a Democratic President with a Democratic Senate majority to form a government. I thought that was the right thing to do, and we changed the rules in the right way.  The Senate passed standing orders with bipartisan support and a new law, the Presidential Appointment Efficiency and Streamlining Act, which eliminated confirmation for several positions. That bipartisan working group of Senators accomplished a lot in 2011, 2012, and 2013.  We eliminated secret holds. After over 25 years of bipartisan effort, led by Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, we eliminated delays caused by the reading of amendments. We eliminated Senate confirmation of 163 major positions.  Now, remember what we were doing was working in a bipartisan way to try to make it easier for President Obama and a Democratic majority in the Senate to confirm the 1,200 Presidential nominees that every President has to send over here for advice and consent. We did it for President Obama. We intended to do it for his successors as well.  We eliminated 3,163 minor career positions. We made 272 positions so-called privileged nominations, which means these nominations can move faster through the Senate. We sped up motions to proceed to legislation. We made it easier to go to conference. We limited postcloture debate on sub-Cabinet positions to 8 hours and on Federal district judges to 2 hours for the 113th Congress. All of these changes took effect immediately over these 60 days.  Let me underscore what I am about to say. Republicans did not insist, in 2011, 2012, and 2013, when Barack Obama was President, that these new rules should be delayed until after the next Presidential election when there might be a Republican President. Republicans supported these changes for the benefit of this institution, even though they would immediately benefit a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate majority.  I propose that we do that again. I invite my Democratic colleagues to join me in demonstrating the same sort of bipartisan respect for the Senate as an institution that Senators Reid and McConnell--the two Senate leaders at that time--Senators Schumer, Barrasso, Levin, McCain, Kyl, Cardin, Collins, Lieberman, and I did in 2011, 2012, and 2013, when we worked to change the Senate rules the right way.  Now, 2 weeks ago, the Rules Committee gave us an opportunity to do things again in the right way by reporting to the Senate a resolution by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt, the chairman of the Rules Committee. This resolution, which is similar to the standing order that 78 Senators voted for on January 14, 2013, would reduce postcloture debate time for nominations. Remember, that is after day one, the majority leader files cloture; day two, nothing happens; day three, we have a vote on cloture that is by 51 votes, and we would reduce the time for debate on day three. District judges would be debated for 2 hours, the same as the 2013 standing order that 78 Senators voted for. Other sub-Cabinet positions would be subject to 2 hours of postcloture debate as well.  The proposal offered by Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt would not reduce the postcloture debate time for Supreme Court Justices, for Cabinet members, for circuit court or certain Board nominations, like the National Labor Relations Board, but would divide the 30 hours of postcloture debate equally between Republicans and Democrats.  The Lankford-Blunt proposal would put the Senate back where it has historically been on nominations. With rare exceptions, Senate nominations have always been decided by majority vote. Let me say that again. With rare exceptions, Senate nominations have always been decided by majority vote.  President Johnson's nomination of Abe Fortas as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was the only example of a Supreme Court nominee who was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.  There has never been, in the history of the Senate, a Cabinet nominee who was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes. There has never been, in the history of the Senate, a Federal district judge whose nomination was blocked by requiring more than 51 votes.  Since 1949, Senate rules have allowed one Senator to insist on a cloture vote; that is, 60 votes, which requires more than a majority to end debate. Even though it was allowed, it just wasn't done. Even the vote on the acrimonious nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court was decided by a majority vote of 52 to 48. Not one Senator tried to block the nomination by requiring 60 votes on a cloture motion, even though one Senator could have done that.  Only when Democrats began, in 2003, to block President George W. Bush's nominees by insisting on a 60-vote cloture vote did that tradition change. Then, in 2017, using the Harry Reid precedent, Republicans restored the tradition of requiring a majority vote to approve all Presidential nominees, which, as I have said, has been the tradition throughout the history of the Senate.  Also, until recently, with rare exceptions, nominations have been considered promptly. After all, there are 1,200 of them, and the Senate has other things to do besides just being in the personnel business.  For example, last month, I was in Memphis for the investiture of Mark Norris, whose nomination languished for 10 months on the Senate calendar. The evening before, I had dinner with 94-year-old Harry W. Wellford. In November of 1970, Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee had recommended Harry Wellford to serve as a district court judge on the same court where Mark Norris now serves.  By December 11, 1970, 1 month later, President Nixon had nominated Harry Wellford, and the Senate had confirmed him. All this happened in 1 month. Not all nominations have moved that fast. In 1991, a Democratic Senator, using a secret hold, blocked President George H. W. Bush's nomination of me as U.S. Education Secretary. I waited on the calendar for 6 weeks. Those 6 weeks seemed like an awfully long time to me, and that was for a Cabinet position. It was not 10 months for a part-time position for the Tennessee Valley Authority.  Two weeks ago, I voted to report Senator Lankford and Senator Blunt's resolution to the full Senate, even though no Democrat voted for it. I will vote for it again on the floor, even if no Democrat will join us. I will also join my fellow Republicans, if we are forced to change the rules by majority vote. I do not like the Harry Reid precedent, but I like even less the debasement of the Senate's constitutional power to provide advice and consent to 1,200 Presidential nominees.  My preference is to adopt the Lankford-Blunt resolution, which is very similar to the 2013 resolution that 78 Senators voted for, and to do it in a bipartisan way, according to the written Senate rules as we did in 2013.  I believe most Democrats privately agree that the resolution offered by Senators Lankford and Blunt is reasonable, and they will be grateful that it is in place when there is a Democratic majority and one Republican Senator can block a Democratic President's nominees.  The only objection Democrats seem to have to the Lankford-Blunt resolution is that it would apply to President Trump. Their other major objection, which is truly puzzling, is that the proposed change is permanent, and the change we made in 2013 was temporary. Well, I wonder if Democrats would like it better if we made this change in the Senate temporary, only applying to the remainder of President Trump's term.  This is my invitation to my Democratic colleagues. Join me and Senators Lankford and Blunt in supporting their resolution, or modifying it if you believe there is a way to improve it, and working in a bipartisan way, exactly as we did in 2011, 2012, and 2013.  A year or so ago, one of the Supreme Court Justices was asked: How do you Justices get along so well when you have such different opinions? This Justice's reply was this: We try to remember that the institution is more important than any of our opinions.  We Senators would do well to emulate the Supreme Court Justices in respecting and strengthening this institution in which we are privileged to serve. One way to do that is to join together to restore the prompt consideration of any President's 1,200 nominees and do it in a bipartisan way that shows the American people our written rules mean what they say."

I was delighted to learn this year's title will be given to Ernest Matt House, a lifelong resident of London, KY, and a remarkable example of entrepreneurship. I would like to take a few moments today to pay tribute to Ernest Matt and his many accomplishments in Kentucky.  From an early age, Ernest Matt's talents were on full display. In high school, he excelled both in the classroom and on the field, earning 14 varsity letters and a place in the Kentucky High School Athletic Association's Hall of Fame, but these achievements, of course, were just the beginning. Ernest Matt received a full scholarship to play football at Eastern Kentucky University. There, he was EKU's starting quarterback for 3 years and lettered all 4. His notable time in the Colonel's uniform merited inclusion into the school's athletic hall of fame, and he still ranks among the best quarterbacks in its history.  After his graduation, Ernest Matt returned to Laurel County and began working at his family's grocery store. Named for both of his grandfathers, he had big shoes to fill in the family business, but it didn't take long for Ernest Matt to learn the competitive business and set his sights on the future. Although a lot has changed in the grocery business and in the community, Ernest Matt holds onto the tradition of personal service that keeps bringing loyal customers back to the store. Over the next years, his continued entrepreneurial success earned him distinction both in the local community and across the Nation.  Leadership Tri-County was established more than three decades ago to foster and develop emerging local leaders. Its programs in Kentucky invest in the men and women who have spent their lives making their communities a better place to live. This award is given each year to an individual who has contributed to the area's growth and development, and Ernest Matt clearly fits the bill. Through his business success and service on local, regional, and State board and commissions, Ernest Matt has quite a legacy of achievement.  A man of deep faith, Ernest Matt credits his good works both to Christ and to his loving family, especially his wife Kim. I am sure she, along with his children and grandchildren, are quite proud of him. Kentucky has been made better because of Ernest Matt's many contributions, and I would like to congratulate him for being named the 2019 Leader of the Year. I encourage my Senate colleagues to join me in recognizing his work."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I would like to offer my congratulations to Tom Fontana, special assistant to the CEO for the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, CVC, on his retirement after 30 years of Federal service.  Tom began his career at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1988. He was responsible for communications for one of the Corps' largest projects, the renovation of the Pentagon in the 1990s. He eventually joined the U.S. Department of Defense, where he continued working to successfully completing the project. Tom was at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, when a plane hijacked by terrorist crashed into the building.  While Tom had just accepted a position with the Architect of the Capitol, AOC, to manage communications for the construction phase of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center, due to the tragedy, he remained in his position at the Pentagon to lend assistance before assuming his role with the CVC in 2001. Throughout the construction of the CVC, Tom provided countless tours and briefings to Members of Congress, including leadership and their staff. Given his depth of knowledge, responsiveness, and evenhandedness through that challenging time, Tom earned great respect from the Members of Congress and the media in Washington.  In 2008, Tom subsequently assumed the role of director of communications and marketing for the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. Under Tom's leadership, the CVC communications division expanded from providing the basics of a startup operation, to providing a wide range of communications to help visitors learn about the Capitol and workings of Congress. He has always looked for ways to take advantage of new technologies to engage visitors, students in particular, about Congress's history. Under his leadership, the first AOC apps were developed, and one of them received a national award for its innovation.  For many Members of Congress, dignitaries, AOC, and CVC staff, Tom is the authoritative voice on the Capitol Visitor Center. He is widely respected for his unique knowledge about the Capitol building and grounds. From presenting inspiring tours to engaging visitors who are simply seeking directions, he personifies an experience all visitors expect when they come to the U.S. Capitol. Tom is an ambassador for the CVC, the Capitol, and Congress without equal.  Tom has also been an incredible asset to me and my office throughout his leadership at the CVC. Every year, I host a unique dinner on Capitol Hill for governmental leaders from all over the continent of Africa, including heads of state, legislators, and cabinet members. Ambassadors and guests who are key leaders in Africa also attend, along with several U.S. legislators. Prior to the dinner, we provide the guests with a tour of the Capitol to learn more about our Capitol building and the workings of Congress. Throughout all of the years I have held the tour and dinner, Tom has gone above and beyond what was required to make our guests feel welcome and to ensure that everything runs smoothly. His role in the success of our event has become so essential that, several years ago, we began inviting Tom to the dinner not only to support it, but to take part in it.  Tom leaves big shoes to fill. My Senate colleagues and I appreciate Tom's hard work and commitment to our Capitol and country. He will be missed, but I wish him all the best in his retirement."

Sadly, Sergeant Rambo passed away earlier this month. He will be remembered for his loving spirit and lifetime of service.  Sergeant Rambo served as an explosive detection MWD based out of MCCS Cherry Point, NC, from January 6, 2011, to April 11, 2012. Throughout his Active Duty, Sergeant Rambo completed 620 stateside searches, two official stateside missions, and about 1,000 hours of training. Unfortunately, a left shoulder injury prevented him from deploying. Nonetheless, he served valiantly alongside his handler, protecting their base and the community until retirement.  Connecticut native Lisa Phillips, who served in the U.S. Army as a veterinary technician, adopted Sergeant Rambo after his retirement. Despite needing an amputation because of his earlier injury, he remained committed to serving his Nation.  Well loved by people of all ages and capacities, Sergeant Rambo visited summer youth groups and local nursing homes, connecting with and bringing hope to children with special needs and elderly people suffering from dementia. His joyful and empathetic personality allowed him to bond with people across the Nation.  Sergeant Rambo also used his experiences to highlight animal welfare, military, and veteran issues. He became the mascot for Alamo Honor Flight, accompanying World War II veterans to Washington, DC, and for Gizmo's Gift, a nonprofit that supports people who have adopted retired working dogs by offering free medical care and other necessary financial support. He and Lisa attended press events with me, helping gain backing for the Canine Members of the Armed Forces Act, which sought to improve care for MWDs once their Active Duty ends by streamlining the adoption process and establishing a national non-profit to cover the veterinary costs associated with retired working dogs. Several provisions of that act have become law.  In 2015, the American Humane Association named Sergeant Rambo the Military Dog of the Year. He and Lisa used this platform to give a TEDx Talk the next year about MWDs and Gizmo's Gift. Then, in March 2017, they testified before the Connecticut General Assembly about a bill to establish K-9 Veterans Day in our State.  My wife Cynthia and I extend our deepest sympathies to Lisa during this difficult time. We know without a doubt that Sergeant Rambo's legacy will leave a positive impact on the lives he touched and causes he championed for years to come."

As chairman of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize a small business that exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial spirit. Today, it is my distinct pleasure to name Magellan Transport Logistics, of Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.  Founded in 2006, Magellan Transport Logistics is a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business dedicated to providing its customers with a wide range of transportation needs. Tom Piatak founded Magellan Transport Logistics based on many of the same qualities that he learned while serving in the U.S. Army. A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy, Tom instills into the company the values he learned from West Point, as well as from his service as a combat engineer during Operation Desert Storm.  Today, Tom serves as chief executive officer and chairman of Magellan. Under his guidance, the company has quickly become a leader in supporting the vast transportation needs of its clients. Tom and his team have gained much of their success by recruiting some of the most talented leaders and logistics professionals in the industry. By instituting four core values of entrepreneurship, ownership mentality, innovation, and transparency within the company, Magellan has created a positive culture that has translated into rapid growth and success. In March of 2018, Magellan announced the acquisition of a 47,000-square-foot warehouse and the hiring of 100 employees over the next 5 years, furthering its investment in the Jacksonville community.  Magellan is known for its dedication to its employees and as a pillar of the Jacksonville community. The company offers complete logistics and transportation services, both local and international, by truck or airplane, while also providing warehousing services and supply chain management. Magellan has built strong relationships with its clients by embracing the ``no man left behind'' principle that Tom learned during his time serving our country in the U.S. Army.  As a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business, Magellan is committed to hiring veterans and participating in community service events to benefit America's veterans. This past December, Magellan sponsored 20 wreaths for National Wreaths Across America Day, as well as assisted with unloading and placing the memorial wreaths on the graves of fallen servicemembers. Magellan actively supports the Wounded Warrior Project, and their commitment to veterans in their community is a testament to the company's values.  In addition to their continued service to our Nation's veterans, Magellan has also aided the community in disaster relief efforts. Following Hurricane Michael in the fall of 2018, Magellan worked directly with FEMA, providing 40 trucks and three staff members as part of the disaster recovery effort. They also partnered with Operation BBQ Relief, a nonprofit organization, to deliver meals and supplies to families throughout impacted areas.  Tom Piatak and Magellan are regularly honored for their success and dedication to the Jacksonville community. During the 2017-2018 NFL football season, the Jacksonville Jaguars honored Magellan as their Veteran Business Owner of the Week. The Jacksonville Business Journal recognized Tom and the team at Magellan for their efforts to hire veterans, and the Wounded Warrior Project awarded the company with the Wounded Warrior Certificate of Recognition in 2017.  Tom Piatak's work to grow Magellan Transport Logistics while staying committed to his community and veterans represents the dedication to service for which Florida entrepreneurs are well known. Through hard work, Tom and his team at Magellan Transport Logistics have built a successful business grounded in strong values, while serving as an example of superior corporate citizenship. I would like to congratulate Tom and the entire team at Magellan Transport Logistics for being named the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success."

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 583, the Preventing Illegal Radio Abuse Through Enforcement Act, or PIRATE Act, a bill sponsored by myself and Mr. Bilirakis. This measure is a bipartisan, commonsense bill that passed the House last Congress.  Mr. Speaker, first, a heartfelt thank you to everyone who has worked on this measure. I thank Representative Bilirakis for agreeing to lead this effort with me in this Congress. I thank our former colleague, Congressman Leonard Lance, for all his work on this bill in the past. And I thank the New York State broadcasters for their dedication.  For years, I, along with many Members of the New York and New Jersey delegations, have voiced our concern that pirate radio operators are a threat to Americans' public health and safety. Yet these lawbreakers are as prevalent as ever, and their actions have been met with few consequences. This legislation responds directly to that threat.  The FCC has taken some positive steps to remedy this issue, but more needs to be done.  In short, the PIRATE Act would increase penalties and restrictions on pirate radio.  Whether a radio frequency is being used by first responders coordinating to save lives, or parents who want to keep obscenity and bigotry away from their children, for example, our communities are better served when broadcasters respect the rule of law.  Previous drafts of the PIRATE Act included provisions creating liability for those who facilitate illegal pirate radio operation. These provisions were removed as being duplicative with existing law. For example, under current law, the FCC can hold a property owner liable for allowing a pirate radio operator access or other assistance.  Cutting these provisions should not be taken as limiting the Commission's authority to assess fines against those who assist illegal pirate operations. On the contrary, the consequences established in this act would also apply in these contexts. The text of the bill before us today includes changes that were requested in the Senate last Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support for H.R. 583 from the 50 State broadcast associations. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 583 is a bipartisan, commonsense advance in the laws that support our first responders and protect our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation so it can be taken up in the Senate and signed into law."

This bill gives the Federal Communications Commission, along with State and local law enforcement, more tools to go after pirate radio operators. Without the ability to effectively go after illegal transmitters, the FCC and other entities cannot protect the over 240 million Americans who rely on radio broadcasting for vital news and entertainment.  Furthermore, stopping bad actors from pirating our airwaves improves public safety by preventing unlawful broadcasts from interfering with first responders' lifesaving communications and public safety officials' transmission of critical information in an emergency.

From working as a teenage janitor at my dad's radio station to spending more than 20 years as a radio station owner myself; in fact, I'm still a licensed amateur radio operator today. But you don't need that much experience to understand that protecting our public airwaves from illegal pirate radio interference is important for consumers and broadcasters alike. The PIRATE Act gives the FCC additional tools to address the growing pirate radio problem and increases the penalties for bad actors. These illegal broadcasts deprive Americans of important programming provided by legitimate broadcast license-holders serving the public interest. And they can disrupt important public safety communications, including our nation's Emergency Alert System and critical aviation frequencies. In many cases, these pirate radio stations broadcast vile and vulgar content, which also harms consumers. By preventing illegal pirate radio operations, consumers are protected, and airwaves are kept free for legitimate broadcasts and public safety announcements.

This bill, which I have coauthored with the gentlewoman from Indiana, Congresswoman Susan Brooks, reauthorizes for an additional 5 years the national network of poison control centers, known as PCCs, which play a critical role in the fight to end the opioid crisis.  Our country's 55 poison centers are staffed by trained toxicologists, pharmacists, physicians, and nurses who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to provide real-time lifesaving assistance via a national toll-free number, which is 1-800-222-1222. Some 330 million people are served by these critical centers, while handling 2.6 million cases.  In 2017, someone called a poison center roughly every 12 seconds in our country. More than 90 percent of those calls were due to poison exposure in someone's home, and more than half of all cases involved children under the age of 12. That is why speedy access to poison centers is such an invaluable resource, especially for parents.  Poison centers also save hundreds of millions in Federal dollars by helping to avoid the unnecessary use of medical services and shortening the length of time a person spends in the hospital, if hospitalization due to poisoning is necessary.  It is clear that these centers are a smart public health investment, but they are also an integral part of our response to the opioid epidemic.  Since 2011, poison centers handled nearly 200 cases per day involving opioid misuse. Data from poison centers helped to detect trends in the epidemic, and experts helped educate Americans about the crisis in ways that could potentially save the lives of their loved ones.  The Upstate New York Poison Center, for instance, used the New York State Fair to educate New Yorkers about proper use of naloxone, the overdose reversal drug. This bill would make sure that activities like this can continue.  Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of coauthoring the last poison center reauthorization signed into law in 2014, and I am pleased to have worked on this important bill.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brooks for partnering with me on this legislation, as well as Congresswoman DeGette and Congresswoman Herrera Beutler for being original cosponsors. Let me also thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for their assistance in bringing this bill to the floor today.  As I mentioned earlier, in Westchester County, New York, much of which I represent, 124 people died due to opioids in 2016. In the Bronx, part of which I also represent, more New Yorkers died of overdoses than in any other borough in New York City.  We must do more to end this epidemic, and I am pleased to see this legislation moving forward as part of that effort.

Poison control centers are also essential to combating the opioid crisis because not only are these centers often the first resource people seek after an opioid overdose occurs, but they also collect real time data to alert impacted communities about opioid abuse and misuse.  Last Congress, Rep. Brooks led similar legislation, which passed this House by voice vote and was then included in the House-passed version of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act, our broad legislative package to combat the opioid crisis.

The House passed a nearly identical bill, H.R. 5086, in the 115th Congress and, unfortunately, that is as far as the bill got. Hopefully, we can get more movement on it this time around, get it through the Senate, and to the President's desk for his signature.  Mr. Speaker, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act is a bill I introduced to spur entrepreneurship and turn American innovation into American jobs. This bill expands the National Science Foundation's highly successful Innovation Corps, or I-Corps program, a program I am proud to have championed since its inception in 2011.  I-Corps teaches scientists and engineers, including many women and underrepresented minorities, how to turn their federally-funded laboratory research into successful products and services.  The program has educated more than 1,300 teams, representing 271 universities in 47 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. It has been linked to almost 650 startup companies that have raised almost $300 million in follow-on funding.  In the 114th Congress, I led the effort that authorized I-Corps and expanded its reach to other agencies, including the National Institutes of Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy.  The Federal Government invests billions of dollars in research and development annually, both at government facilities, such as national labs, and at universities and research institutions. I-Corps is a modest investment that leads to a higher return on our research spending by significantly increasing rates of commercialization, economic activity, and job creation.  Our economy is driven by the ingenuity of our scientists and engineers, developing innovations today that become tomorrow's great products. And yet, still only a small minority of federally-funded research with commercial potential ever makes it to the marketplace. The I-Corps program helps to change that.  This bill expands I-Corps to meet some pressing needs.  First, it helps more people participate in the program. Right now, unless you are a grantee of NSF or another agency with an I-Corps program, the training can be difficult to access. This bill will give recipients of small business grants from any Federal agency the flexibility to pay for I-Corps with their grant funds, and will also allow other entrepreneurs to apply and pay out-of-pocket to participate.  Second, the bill directs NSF to establish a new course as part of the I-Corps program to teach scientist-entrepreneurs how to start and grow a company. While the current I-Corps course does a great job of helping scientists and engineers determine who their customers are and whether their innovation is suitable for commercialization, it offers only limited guidance on what to do after a scientist makes the decision to become an entrepreneur.  Skills like how to write a business plan, hire a team, and attract investment are taught in business schools, but not in Ph.D. programs. NSF recognized this need and has already begun a pilot program to test curriculum for this new course. This bill will make sure the new course is fully developed and made available around the country.  Finally, this bill requires a GAO assessment of the I-Corps program, its first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created. Although the program's success to date speaks for itself, it is important to continuously improve it by developing metrics to measure its performance and ensure that Federal funds are well spent.  This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders, including the ``father of modern entrepreneurship,'' who developed the curriculum that I-Corps is based on, Steve Blank; the former NSF program officer, who founded the program, Dr. Errol Arkilic; and several directors of I-Corps Nodes around the country.  This bill is also endorsed by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, the National Venture Capital Association, the Association of American Universities; the Council on Governmental Relations; and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.  I thank my cosponsors, Daniel Webster of Florida, Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, and Ranking Member Frank Lucas of Oklahoma. I also thank Senators Coons and Young, who are cosponsors of the Senate companion to this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I believe that helping our scientists, engineers, and academics not only advance our knowledge and understanding of the world, but also create jobs and products that fuel our economy, is a goal we all can share.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

H.R. 539 extends the outreach of the National Science Foundation's Innovation Corps program, also known as I-Corps. I-Corps trains and prepares scientists and engineers to take their research from the lab and turn it into commercial products and services.  Research labs are making breakthroughs in new fields like quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and bioengineering. These breakthroughs will continue to transform our lives and the world we live in.  But many scientists and engineers are not trained for commercializing these discoveries and did not go to business school or take any business development classes. I-Corps gives researchers the tools to maximize the taxpayer investment in basic research and spur innovation.  H.R. 539 expands the eligible pool for I-Corps courses and allows a portion of Federal small business grants be used to cover I-Corps training expenses.  The bill also allows any private citizen to apply to participate and pay out-of-pocket.  Finally, H.R. 539 authorizes a new I-Corps boot-camp course that teaches valuable skills, like structuring a company, attracting investors, and hiring staff.  In my district, Oklahoma State University has a successful support system for business startups, both on and off campus. I-Corps is a key part of that system, helping students and faculty learn how to commercialize their ideas and build a business.

I know engineers are lacking in that area. I am one. I think I invented, before I was 21 years old, about three or four, maybe five, things which were really awesome; but nobody bought them except me, and it wasn't good.  So this program assists scientists and engineers in the development of their academic research and equips them to bring research into a private market where jobs can be created and money can be won through that. We witnessed the wonderful success of this program in my home State of Florida, the University of Central Florida.  H.R. 539 expands the I-Corps program to create a new course in commercial-ready companies. Individuals who have completed an existing I-Corps course would be eligible for this new course which will help them create, market, and, eventually, expand their private-sector company.

The bill we are considering today takes the breakthrough lessons of customer development first codified by Steve Blank, whose teachings are engrained in the conscience of many business school students--but less of our Ph.D. students--and forms the basis of the NSF I-Corps program, a program that has already proven its worth at turning breakthrough scientific research into successful commercial enterprise.  Since this program was created in 2011, more than 600 startups have been formed through the various I-Corps sites, including in my home State of Ohio at the University of Akron, The Ohio State University, and the University of Toledo.  As just one example, University of Akron I-Corps startup Fontus Blue provides decisionmaking software that helps water treatment plants to produce consistently excellent drinking water. The software is used by plants in 24 cities across the U.S., Canada, and Brazil.  The bill before us today expands upon the success of the current program by opening up access to small business innovation research grantees and also private individuals. Additionally, this bill allows small business innovation research grants and the small business technology transfer grants to be used to access I-Corps training.  Finally, this bill would require I-Corps to develop a course for commercialization-ready teams to help them learn the skills needed to attract investors, build a brand, and scale a business.  As we confront the economic challenges of the 21st century, it will be our innovators and entrepreneurs who will create solutions to these seemingly intractable problems by channeling the entrepreneurial spirit and force of will that has driven our country to its greatest economic heights.  The Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act safeguards our economy by empowering future generations of entrepreneurs in all corners of our country to turn their wildest dreams into our collective achievements.

I thank Mr. Lipinski for his leadership on this bipartisan legislation and look forward to working with him to see it through to the President's desk.  Each dollar the U.S. invests in research grants at our universities is a dollar toward the birth of potentially game-changing discoveries and innovation. Innovation is the lifeblood of our economy. The job creation and economic security gains created by scientific advances can only be enjoyed if we fully support the innovation ecosystem from discovery to commercialization. Finding ways to maximize the benefits of federally funded research is critical to U.S. competitiveness in the global market.  H.R. 539 does just that. This bill creates a link between two of our most important programs that focus on creating a sustainable path from laboratory to market for valuable scientific research. This bill expands participation in the Innovation Corps Program to Small Business Innovation Program grantees. Started at the National Science Foundation, the Innovation Corps program, or I-Corps, helps prepare scientists and engineers to think beyond the university lab and gives them the skills to identify products with commercial potential and to be successful entrepreneurs. The Small Business Innovation Program and Small Business Technology Transfer Program, known as SBIR and STTR, are valuable programs that provide competitive research and development grants and contracts to innovative small businesses.  H.R. 539 also seeks make available specialized I-Corps courses in all aspects of preparing a product to go to market. This is a vital component which can help identify market failures and premature business formation. Unfortunately, too many innovative ideas do not make it to the commercialization phase. This bill will help increase those odds.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 539."

I want to thank Mr. Dunn and Mr. Lamb for introducing this important legislation.  Now, more than ever, U.S. global competitiveness depends on our ability to grow and sustain a STEM-capable workforce poised to meet the needs of the private sector. With an economy that is rapidly evolving and increasingly reliant on big data automation and advanced technologies, the workforce is struggling to keep up.  Although STEM careers offer good pay and job security, companies across all sectors report having difficulty recruiting workers with the skills that they need.  The good news is veterans and transitioning servicemembers represent a group of highly trained individuals with STEM knowledge base and skill sets employers need. The question is how to get more veterans to produce STEM degrees and join the STEM workforce.  H.R. 425 addresses this question by supporting research to identify and lower barriers for veterans transitioning from military to civilian work environments. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to develop a comprehensive plan for outreach to veterans with the goal of increasing veteran participation in the agency STEM education and research programs.  It also requires NSF, in its biennial Science and Engineering Indicators report, to publish available data on veterans in STEM studies and careers.  Further, the bill adds veterans as a target demographic for outreach under several existing NSF programs, including the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.  Finally, H.R. 425 creates an interagency committee on veterans in STEM and directs the creation of a strategic plan for transitioning and training veterans and military spouses into STEM careers.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 425 will help us cement our global leadership by ensuring more veterans with the STEM skills we need are able to translate their talent into STEM careers. I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

First, I would like to thank the gentleman from Florida, Dr. Dunn, for his leadership in helping connect veterans to these good jobs.  Veterans are working today. Most Americans are working today. The unemployment rate is low. And yet everywhere I go, I meet businesspeople who tell me that they can't find the right workers for the right jobs at the right time. If we could fix this, we would stop being held back by the shortage of workforce that we face, and, most importantly, our families would not be held back by lower paychecks.  But these new jobs in cybersecurity, in medical technology, in advanced manufacturing, they are hard jobs and they require training. We need to make the training available to people where they live at a cost that they can actually afford. We have no time to waste.  Our businesses are competing on a global stage against countries that will use the full machinery of their governments to make sure their workforces are ready. We need to meet their efforts with an even greater one.  Luckily, we already have a workforce that will go anywhere and do anything. When it comes to hard work, these folks are fearless. That is the veteran population here in the United States.  Marine officers are trained that if we are given an order to move that mountain over there, no sooner is the order completed than we are leading 100 marines down the road with shovels.  I still have great faith in the ability of 100 marines with shovels, but what we really need today are hundreds of thousands of veterans who can 3D print those shovels, put them in the hands of robots, program them to go down the road, and defend the entire network from foreign intrusion.  These are the jobs of today and tomorrow. These are the jobs that will support our families. Most importantly, these are the jobs that will grow the new middle class.  We want to make sure veterans get these jobs. To do that, we are going to use this bill to turn to the National Science Foundation. The National Science Foundation was born in the aftermath of World War II to make sure that we led the world in science and math, and the most important advancements. We knew that if we did that, we could make our country safe, healthy, and strong.  If we are going to continue that mission in the new generation, we will need veterans to lead the way.  We do have a global competition on our hands, Mr. Speaker, and I know we can win it if we have the veterans with us. This bill will help them, and I urge all my colleagues to come together to pass it."

H.R. 425, the Supporting Veterans in STEM Careers Act, is about helping expand veterans' job and education opportunities in the sciences. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to develop a veterans outreach plan and publish data on veterans' participation in mathematics, science, and technology in its annual ``Science and Engineering Indicators'' report.  The bill also updates the NSF Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, its fellowship programs, and the cyber grant programs to include outreach to veterans.  Additionally, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy is tasked with overseeing an interagency working group to examine how to increase veteran participation in the STEM career fields, including addressing any barriers for both servicemembers and their spouses.  In the next 5 years, between 1 million and 1.5 million members of the Armed Forces will separate from the military, according to the Department of Defense. Many of these veterans will be seeking new careers, and by a great margin, veterans cite finding employment as their number-one need when separating from Active-Duty service.  According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations in STEM fields are projected to grow to more than 9 million jobs by 2022. Research shows that many military veterans already have skills and training that align with STEM careers, particularly in the area of information technology.  However, it also shows that veterans face many barriers as they reenter the workforce, including a lack of formal certified STEM education, career guidance, and the difficult task of transferring military credits to civilian college credits.  Our Nation's veterans deserve every opportunity to transition to a rewarding and successful civilian life. This bill will help all servicemembers continue to serve our Nation in new ways by fulfilling 21st century jobs and keeping America on the cutting edge of innovation.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Lamb, a fellow member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee and a Marine Corps veteran, for cosponsoring this bipartisan legislation. And I salute my fellow veterans on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee who joined me in introducing this bill.

I thank my colleagues across the aisle, the gentlewoman from Nevada, and also all those who are original cosponsors in support of this bill.  It is not uncommon for a school employee to make a lasting impression on a student or even on entire generations of students. Front office attendants, school custodians, school safety personnel, food service workers, and others all interface directly with countless students every day. Many of these school employees make lifelong impacts on the students who they serve.  Ask any student and they will probably tell you about a particular school employee who may not have been their teacher, but, nevertheless, imparted crucial life lessons upon them or inspired joy and confidence in students who struggled to find either. Schools are made better by these leaders, and students benefit from their kindness, thoughtfulness, compassion, and respect that they show to others around them.  Mr. Speaker, these employees truly go above and beyond the call of duty to serve American students, and their steadfast devotion deserves our appreciation and recognition.  H.R. 276, the Recognizing Achievement in Classified School Employees Act, will direct the Secretary of Education to establish the Recognizing Inspiring School Employees Award, otherwise known as the RISE Award. The RISE Award will be presented each year to a classified school employee in a nonteaching position in recognition of their invaluable contribution to the lives of students at the schools that they serve.  The award will be nonmonetary and will go to employees who demonstrate excellent work performance, school and community involvement, leadership, and commitment, and who exemplify the very best of what it means to be a classified school employee.  H.R. 276 is just one small way to honor the men and women in our communities who demonstrate to students what it means to be outstanding citizens and civic leaders.

I would like to address the bill before you by telling you the story of Ms. Virginia Mills. Ms. Mills started her career as a security guard at William E. Orr Middle School in District One in Las Vegas over two decades ago.  Almost immediately upon getting to the school, she saw that children were going to school without backpacks on their shoulders to carry their books and equipment. She saw athletes trying out for the basketball team without having the proper shoes on their feet. She saw children who didn't have enough clothes to make it through the whole week without changing.  So in her very first month on the job, taking old items from her own daughter's closet, she started a clothes closet for middle school students in need. She first enlisted the help of friends, then teachers, and then community members. Eventually, the closet grew to include school supplies and even food for children to take home on the weekends, when they might otherwise go hungry.  Ms. Mills has watched these students grow over the years to become assemblymen and -women in the legislature, business leaders, and community organizers. She said: ``Giving a helping hand to these students has inspired them to become better adults . . . . They now understand the importance of paying it forward.''  Virginia Mills has improved the lives of so many middle school students in my district, and she has filled a gap that too many young people are in danger of falling into. And she wanted me to tell you that she didn't do it alone.  There are countless people in our schools, including security guards who do more than keep students safe; they keep them motivated. There are bus drivers who provide more than just a ride; they offer friendship. There are counselors and nurses and cafeteria workers who strive tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure the success of our students in our schools. Yet, too often, their contributions go unrecognized.  That is why I introduced this bipartisan legislation to celebrate the critical role that school staff plays in helping our students learn and enabling our teachers to teach. The contributions of these vital school employees can't really be measured, but they can and should be recognized.  It is in our children's interest and certainly in our national interest for the Department of Education to present these RISE Awards to people like Virginia Mills who have made such a profound impact on our Nation's youth. So for those who work so hard to help our students become the best versions of themselves, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''"

I have had the privilege and honor to be in our schools that are recognized as the Blue Ribbon Schools and Schools to Watch, and those are wonderful.

What this piece of legislation does, Mr. Speaker, is to take that down to the staff level, because we know that the most valuable resource and asset that we have in our schools are people--not necessarily the classroom or anything that is physical like that, but it is the teachers, the faculty, and the staff. Being able to recognize the staff who work so hard each and every day there who are not necessarily teachers is a great opportunity.

Mr. Speaker, I thank House leadership for bringing H.R. 1235, the MSPB Temporary Term Extension Act, so quickly to the floor at the request of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.  Chairman Cummings and I introduced this bill to prevent a potential crisis at the Merit Systems Protection Board, a vacant Board without any members. Acting Chairman Mark Robbins is and has been the sole member on the Board since January 2017. His holdover term expires at the end of this month, the 28th of February, and it cannot be extended without legislation. We planned to address this issue through regular order, but circumstances arose that prevented us from doing so.  The subcommittee I am going to chair originally scheduled a hearing to examine the problem on February 14, but the hearing was postponed to the end of this month to allow all Members to attend the funerals of our colleagues John Dingell and Walter Jones.  We hoped that the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee would take action to address the problem during its business meeting on February 20. Although the Senate committee was able to approve two nominees for the Board, Chairman Johnson indicated he would withhold those nominations from the Senate floor pending the naming of a third nominee by the White House.  The Senate committee was also reportedly working on language to extend Mr. Robbins' holdover term for another year, but no legislation was considered at the markup, thus our action today.  Given these events, it appears less and less likely that the Senate will be able to confirm new Board members before time runs out this Thursday. That is why the Committee on Oversight and Reform, Chairman Cummings and I, introduced this stopgap measure, H.R. 1235, to ensure some work by the MSPB will continue. The legislation will provide a one-time, 1-year extension for Mr. Robbins' term to give the Senate more time to confirm the additional Board members.  This version of the bill before us eliminates the provision prohibiting dual appointments because Mr. Robbins assured us he would continue to recuse himself from working on matters related to OPM and that he would recuse himself from OPM matters that related to votes he had taken at MSPB if this bill is enacted.  This amendment is in response to many of the concerns raised by our Republican friends.  We urgently need to pass this bill because we need to ensure that MSPB can continue its operations. If Mr. Robbins' term expires without new members confirmed, it will be the first time in the agency's history that the Board has no members at all. We will be entering uncharted new territory, and not good territory.  If there is no principal officer to lead the agency, not only is it unclear which agency functions may continue and which ones must be suspended, but, also, whether the entire agency must shut down completely. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to risk that shutdown.  There is a lot at stake here. MSPB protects whistleblowers from retaliation, veterans from job discrimination, and Federal employees from prohibited personnel practices. The agency ensures that the Federal civil service is nonpartisan and complies with the merit system principles.  Since 2017, MSPB has been operating under certain constraints without a quorum on the Board. This has prevented the Board from hearing final appeals of agency adverse actions.  The absence of a quorum has also prevented the Board from issuing special studies of the civil service and reviews of OPM rules and regulations, as is required. This has resulted in a backlog, Mr. Speaker, of 2,000 final appeals which will take more than 3 years to process and eight Merit Systems studies pending issuance by the Board.  The current situation is certainly less than ideal, but let's not make it worse by doing nothing and creating a complete vacancy on the Board.  This would cause decisions made by Mr. Robbins, by the way, to be voided, exacerbating the backlog, and any new Board members who are finally confirmed would have to start again from square one.  We should not and cannot allow that to happen. Addressing the problem should be a bipartisan concern, and I believe it is. We cannot let politics prevent MSPB from doing its job.  The bill in front of us is supported by the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union, the National Federation of Federal Employees, the Government Accountability Project, Public Citizen, Project on Government Oversight, the Make It Safe Coalition, the Senior Executives Association, and the National Taxpayers Union.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from those organizations and a coalition of other stakeholders. "

My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know that I personally am committed to ensuring the successful operation of the Merit Systems Protection Board, also known as MSPB. In fact, last Congress, I introduced H.R. 6391, the MSPB Reauthorization Act of 2018. My bill would have reauthorized the Board and made other vital reforms. The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform reported the bill favorably, but without a single vote from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  We all know an effective and functional MSPB is important to the health of our Federal workforce. MSPB's primary responsibility is to adjudicate appeals of Federal personnel actions. MSPB also plays a vital role in Federal whistleblower protections.  To be effective and issue decisions, MSPB needs at least a two-member quorum, but the Board has not had a quorum for over 2 years. In January 2017, Mark Robbins, as my friend mentioned, become the sole remaining member of MSPB.  Last year, Mr. Robbins' 7-year term came to an end, and he was granted a 1-year extension as authorized by law, but that extension ends this week. Starting Friday, the MSPB will be without a single Board member.  My colleagues claim this bill is an emergency measure to prevent the MSPB from extending this crisis of leadership, but I disagree. The real problem is the lack of a quorum.  Without a quorum for the last 2 years, a backlog of undecided appeals has grown to over 1,700 cases. Mr. Robbins cannot fix that problem on his own. His continued tenure will not resolve those cases.  In December, the President selected Mr. Robbins to serve as the general counsel at the Office of Personnel Management, so for the last 10 weeks, he has served in both capacities at OPM and MSPB. Mr. Robbins is planning to serve at OPM in his full capacity beginning this Friday.  Mr. Robbins has stayed at MSPB as long as he has out of a sense of duty to MSPB and its mission. I trust that my colleagues do not intend to use this bill to coerce Mr. Robbins to stay any longer than he wants to. I urge my colleagues to join me in applauding Mr. Robbins for his dedication to MSPB, the Federal workforce, the President, and our country. I also urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Senate's confirmation of President Trump's nominees.  We owe it to our Federal workers to give MSPB a quorum so the board can do the important job that Congress gave it to do.  In the future, I certainly hope we can work together to provide certainty to Federal workers and whistleblowers by making MSPB operational once again.

So Mr. Robbins, in a caretaker, interim position, can still do some of the work of the board, including issuing stays, reviewing some of the work, and helping to avoid adding to the backlog.  He can't substitute himself fully, obviously, for a quorum in the board. My colleague is quite right about that.  What we are trying to do here is not to compel him or coerce him to stay against his wishes; it is to try to buy some time and have the board at least do some of its basic functions so that we don't come to a complete standstill. That would not be necessary, frankly, had the Senate acted.  I think my friend is right in suggesting that is the ultimate answer, and I would join him in calling on the Senate to act as swiftly as possible. But I think we have no choice but to act on this bill now.  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."

Karen, thank you so much.  She has been the Clerk of the House for a very long time. She was the Clerk of the House in the 109th and 110th Congresses as well.  Throughout her tenure, she served with distinction, working hard to ensure that the Office of the Clerk always acted in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way, which brought credit on this House and great service to every Member.  Thank you for that, Karen.  Many of us serving in the House have known her even longer, going back to her service on the staff of former Speaker Hastert and former Republican Leader Bob Michel.  I might say of the latter, Bob Michel was one of the finest human beings I have ever known and one of the best Members that I have ever served with. Karen was proud to serve with him, and he, I know, was so fond of Karen and her service to him and to the House.  Now, I may not be totally objective. Karen is a native Marylander. Karen is also a graduate of the University of Maryland, so Karen and I share a lot in common. We live in Maryland; we graduated from Maryland; and we love this House.  I offer her the thanks of the House, its Members, and our staff, as she steps down from this position. I am not sure where Karen is going, but I guarantee you, our loss will be somebody else's gain, because she has the kind of talent, commitment, energy, and faithfulness that will make a real difference wherever she goes.  I also congratulate Cheryl Johnson for becoming the 36th Clerk of the House of Representatives.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, Cheryl returns to the House where she served for 20 years with the Committee on Education and Labor, as well as the Committee on House Administration.  She will bring an extraordinary amount of experience to her job as the Clerk of the House. I know she will do an outstanding job, and I welcome her back to this House, which she has served so ably before.

Karen Haas served this body so well, as the majority leader talked about, and in such a fair way, treating all Members with the dignity and respect that they all deserve as we all carry out the work of the people's House.  When you think about the different roles that she has played, serving this Chamber, this body, for decades in a number of different roles, but, of course, most notably to all of us, twice as Clerk of the House. She was actually here once before, left, realized just how much fun it is to be in this House and work for this great body, and came back.  We thank you for coming back again and for your great service during these times.  So much work goes into the operations of the House. The things that we do on a daily basis, whether it is a Member filing a bill, when you go down to drop your bill in the hopper, it is Karen and the entire team that she has put together at the Office of the Clerk that receives the bills, that processes the bills.  When we all vote for and sometimes against the Journal, it is the Clerk that puts together the Journal of the House to make sure that the things that we do are properly recorded throughout time for people to go review.  It is an important job. But it is the work that she has done that we all see on a daily basis that we are going to miss.  As Cheryl Johnson takes her place, best of luck to you as well. We wish you all the best, but we are going to miss Karen. We wish you the best in your next endeavor. You can come visit us from time to time.  Karen, thank you so much for the work that you have done on behalf of not just us as Members of Congress, but on behalf of all the American people who count on this institution to function properly, for helping us make sure that it is done in a proper, efficient, fair, and impartial way. Best of luck to you, Karen.  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the whip for his comments, and I certainly share his views.

Karen was our 34th Clerk and only the second woman to hold that position. We thank you for that leadership. When we think about the role of the House Clerk, you think of roll calls and recorded votes. But the Office of the Clerk is really about continuity. Without the Clerk, Congress could not fulfill its obligation to the American people and move in a smooth manner, which many people don't see the challenge.  Few individuals are more committed to preserving the continuity than Karen. She has done that as Clerk and as a trusted staff member and floor assistant. Always, she has been a friend and counselor to Members, regardless of what side of the aisle you sat on.  Karen Haas also equipped and modernized this House for the 21st century. Oftentimes, you won't see that because it is behind the scenes, but it makes the legislative process more accessible to the people it serves.

Cheryl Johnson embodies public service and has dedicated her career to strengthening many of the most important institutions of our democracy, including our own.  Indeed, today is a homecoming, as Leader Hoyer has mentioned, as Cheryl returns to the House of Representatives where she worked with distinction and honor for Chairman Lacy Clay, Sr.--I emphasize senior--of the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries and Memorials; and the House Committee on Post Offices and Civil Service Subcommittee on Investigations.  Our country is stronger for her work on the then-Committee on Education and the Workforce to secure justice and progress for our children and advance fairness and respect for our workers.  In the Congress, she earned the respect of all--Members and staff, Democrats and Republicans--for being a leader of compassion, courage, and commitment.  Cheryl returns to the House after more than a decade at the Smithsonian Institution. Her great dedication to that American treasure--which is the largest museum in the world--has ensured that it will remain a source of creativity, innovation, and research for generations to come.  Our Nation is particularly grateful for her extraordinary vision and persistence in helping transform the dream of the National Museum of African American History and Culture into a reality.  Cheryl has made a difference empowering millions of Americans and visitors from abroad to explore and be inspired by the beauty and richness of American culture and history.  Cheryl's strong leadership and deep love and respect for the institutions of our democracy will be vital in her role as House Clerk, strengthening and safeguarding the Congress in the tradition of Karen and the Congress, the first branch of government, Article I.

Among her many achievements, as was mentioned, Cheryl helped to make the National Museum of African American History and Culture a brilliant reality.  But this is not her first tour of duty on Capitol Hill. In fact, she previously spent almost two decades in service to this institution, and as was mentioned, her first position was serving on the committee staff of my father, former Congressman Bill Clay.  She spent 10 years as the chief education and investigative counsel for the Committee on Education and the Workforce where she advanced reforms in elementary and secondary education, juvenile justice, child nutrition, labor issues, and employment and nutrition programs for seniors.  Prior to that, she served as staff director and counsel for the Committee on House Administration's Subcommittee on Libraries and Memorials and then Subcommittee on the Post Office and Civil Service.  Ms. Johnson is a distinguished graduate of Howard University Law School and the University of Iowa. She is married to Clarence and has a son, Bradford.  I go back with Cheryl as a friend for 40 years. Our families are close. Growing up around this institution that we all love, I was fortunate to be in the company of and witness the examples set by many great public servants--Members and staff--who devoted themselves to representing their constituents in the true spirit of public service.

This is, unfortunately, not the first time that we have mourned the unnecessary loss of life from gun violence. Eleven years ago, when I first took office, I inherited a community in mourning: 17 students were injured and 5 were killed in the Cole Hall mass shooting at Northern Illinois University. So I spent my first weeks and months in office doing what I could to help my community recover.  Now, 11 years later, on February 15, the call went out from Aurora, Illinois: Workplace shooting at Henry Pratt. Active gunman. Officers down.  More than 200 police units from across the western suburbs of Chicago responded to contain the situation. They were running toward the sound of gunfire, as they do countless times each day in our country.  Six officers were injured during that response, and, in the aftermath, we learned that we lost five members of our community:  Josh Pinkard, the plant manager at Henry Pratt, who, when fatally shot, sent a final text message to his wife, Terra, to say ``I love you'';  Trevor Wehner, on his first day at work at Pratt as an intern from Northern Illinois University;  Clayton Parks, Trevor's supervisor and also a graduate of NIU;  Vicente Juarez, a hardworking family man who lived with his wife, daughter, and grandchildren on a quiet street in Oswego;  Russell Beyer, a mold operator and union committee chairman from Machinists Local 1202 and the father of two children.  Now, as we have done so many times before in Congress, I will soon ask that we pause for a moment of silence; but this time, I would ask each of you to also think of the voting card that each of us carries on the House floor and the responsibility that you carry with that card, because this week we will finally be voting on legislation for effective and universal background checks for all gun sales. This is legislation supported by both Republicans and Democrats in Congress and supported by 97 percent of the American people.  So, our hearts go out to the family and friends of the victims left behind, and now I ask that we pause for a moment of silence."

As we consider legislation this week that is a critical first step towards preventing gun violence, I would like to take a few moments to honor the lives our community lost this month.  I wish to remember Russell Beyer. Proud chair of his union and a 20-year employee of Henry Pratt, Russell was the father of two and a steadfast Patriots fan.  We remember Clayton Parks, a Northern Illinois University grad whose wife, Abby, describes as an incredible father to their young son, Axel.  We remember Josh Pinkard. ``I want to shout from the rooftops about how amazing Josh was,'' his wife, Terra, wrote about a man who loved God, family, and college football.  We remember Trevor Wehner, a college student at Northern Illinois University, killed on the very first day of his internship. He was described by a friend as someone who would go out of his way for others.  We remember Vicente Juarez. The patriarch of a tight-knit family, Vicente was a caring husband, father, and grandfather to eight. His neighbors loved him for his efforts ridding the neighborhood of dandelions each summer.  We will never forget our five neighbors, and we will never forget the bravery of law enforcement and first responders who rushed toward the violence and undoubtedly saved countless lives.

Not only was he a pioneer of this lifesaving surgery, but also, in the late 1800s, he opened the country's first hospital with an interracial staff, Provident Hospital in Chicago.  Then, in the 1930s, Dr. Helen Dickens did her internship at Provident Hospital before becoming the first Black woman admitted to the American College of Surgeons.  And then, while Dr. Dickens was doing her internship at Provident, a young Black girl growing up in segregated Arkansas dreamed of becoming a doctor. Sixty years later, in 1993, Dr. Joycelyn Elders became America's first African American Surgeon General.  Mr. Speaker, Black history is not something that is in the past. It is constantly unfolding. It is American history.  Our stories are being written and expanded upon all the time.

How do you deal with these young people?  It is clear that the juvenile justice system needs to be reformed. As a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, it is my commitment to listen to people from across the Nation.  Many people don't realize that once you are committed to a juvenile detention center or facility or jail, under juvenile laws in most States, and many of them receiving Federal dollars, you will find that there is no definitive sentence. They are sentenced and could be there from age 14 to 21.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a recent shift we have seen in this country over the recent weeks--that is Americans' views on abortion.  Not long ago, a Marist poll found that 55 percent of Americans were likely to identify as pro-choice compared to about 38 percent identifying as pro-life--indeed, a 17-point gap. Now, the polls are tied.  As reported this week by Axios, a similar Marist poll found that Americans are now, for the first time, equally likely to be pro-life as they are to be pro-choice, both registering at 47 percent.  Why the sudden change? The horrific rhetoric offered by some of the left, that is why, including the Virginia Governor's indefensible remarks that he would support the murder of a baby post-birth. It is inconceivable to me that someone could differentiate a post-birth ``abortion'' from actual murder.  The good news is I think most Americans agree with me. That is why we are seeing, finally, this dramatic shift.  My colleague from Missouri, Representative Ann Wagner, has introduced the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act in order to end infanticide taking place after failed abortion attempts. The Democrats have repeatedly blocked the effort, including tonight. We need to have a vote on this bill."

Among other things, if implemented over the next 10 years, it would eliminate the use of fossil fuels and nuclear power. That means our gasoline-powered vehicles and implements would be useless, and there would be no air travel.  It would also require that virtually all building structures would be rebuilt or need to be remodeled. Every facet of life would be forced to change.  The most frightening thing about this is that my colleagues sponsoring it are actually serious.  Furthermore, the architects failed to explain how they are going to rebuild the economy they would decimate.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to lead a Special Order alongside my colleagues to discuss, frankly, a reckless and misguided and radical proposal recently introduced by some of my Democratic colleagues, the Green New Deal.  Tonight, together with many of my fellow members of the Congressional Western Caucus, we will be taking the time to share with the American people the details of the ill-advised and bizarre provisions included in this green manifesto and the grave impacts that they would have on our Nation's economy. We will also share what we, as Republicans in the people's House, believe when it comes to our national strategy to innovate, diversify, and strengthen America's energy sector.  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal is a bad deal for the American people. This so-called deal calls for cutting of greenhouse gas emissions to net zero in only 10 years.  And while many studies are still working to grasp the perilous impacts and the enormous costs of this proposal, one independent estimate, led by a team of Stanford engineers, suggests it would cost our Nation in the neighborhood of $7 trillion to convert all of America's power to renewable power sources. To quote the former Secretary of Energy under President Obama, Ernest Moniz, he said: ``I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It is just impractical.''  Mr. Speaker, the Green New Deal goes much further than just the energy sector, however. It also mandates the guarantee of a job for everyone, paid vacations for everyone, free college for everyone. It dictates that every existing building in this country must be upgraded and retrofitted for ``comfort.''  It calls for a drastic overhaul of our transportation systems across the country, threatening not only our trucking and airline industries, but also the daily lives of the 85 percent of Americans who drive every morning or evening to get to work.  Mr. Speaker, while calling for all of these implausible mandates, the Green New Deal would also insert the Federal Government into seemingly every aspect of our daily lives.  By expanding our Federal bureaucracy far beyond anything we have ever seen in history and undermining the federalist principles our country was founded upon in the Constitution, this proposal would jeopardize the future of America as we know it. It would sacrifice the American energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors; jeopardize businesses small and large across the Nation; and lead our country down the path of socialist nations like Venezuela, North Korea, and Cuba.  As the Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said after reading the proposal: ``What in the heck is this?''  Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree more.  My State, the great State of Washington, consistently ranks among the top of the list of States with the cleanest energy production. Do you know why that is? It is because of the strong reliance on our incredible system of hydroelectric dams, many of which are in my congressional district along the Columbia and the Snake Rivers.  Nearly 70 percent of our power comes from hydropower, a clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable source of baseload energy.  It also comes from our use of nuclear power. The Columbia Generating Station, which is also in the Fourth Congressional District which I represent, is the only nuclear power plant in the greater Northwest region. It too provides clean, reliable power for the Pacific Northwest.  On top of these sources, Washington State uses a variety of other energy sources, including natural gas, coal, wind, solar, and biomass.  It is because we use an all-of-the-above mix of energy sources, but largely concentrated on clean, renewable, reliable hydropower, that Washington State continues to demonstrate how we can lead in the use of clean energy while still diversifying and thereby strengthening our energy portfolio.  Unfortunately, the Green New Deal negates this ability to do so. Not once is the word ``hydropower'' mentioned in the legislation. And in the frequently asked questions document that was released to accompany the introduction of the Green New Deal, it stated that ``The plan is to transition off of nuclear.''  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to continue to strengthen America's energy independence and increase our use of clean sources of energy, we must absolutely include hydropower and nuclear power. The science says so, the facts say so.  So when Democrats in Congress release a sweeping, colossal overhaul of our Nation's energy policies and do not include these clean energy sources, it is clear that this is far more about politics and not about sound science.  Mr. Speaker, my fellow House Republicans and I continue to advocate for sound, comprehensive approaches to energy policy. We must continue to explore every opportunity to develop viable alternative energy sources, which is why under Republican control of the House in recent Congresses, we have made serious investments in advanced nuclear and basic science research, grid-scale energy storage, and equipped our national laboratories with robust resources to lead the way in research, development, and innovation.  National laboratories, like the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in my district, play a crucial role in developing the basic science research needed to pave the way for these alternative sources. Then when private industry can utilize this research, the open marketplace can put these new sources to use.  That is exactly what our country needs: more collaboration, more innovation; not a top-down mandated system of bureaucratic dictates based upon a green manifesto.  Mr. Speaker, I often share with my constituents that as a third generation farmer, I consider myself to be a conservationist and on the front lines of being a good steward of our natural resources. I know that we must respect our environment, we must ensure clean air and clean water for our citizens, and we must encourage innovative ways to produce energy through a variety of reliable, renewable traditional and alternative sources.  Tonight I am looking forward to hearing from my friends and my colleagues in the Congressional Western Caucus on why the Green New Deal would be catastrophic for their constituents and what we in our Nation's capital should really be prioritizing in order to continue America's energy independence dominance.  So with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to my first speaker, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Stauber), the gentleman that represents the Eighth District of that great State."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues in opposition to the Green New Deal.  This disastrous plan, cooked up by out-of-touch Washington elites, simply does not work for Minnesota families.  According to the Energy Information Administration, 68 percent of Minnesota's energy consumption comes from a combination of coal, natural gas, nuclear, hydropower, and gasoline, all of which are to be banned completely by the Green New Deal in 10 years.  Allowed under this radical pipe dream are wind, solar, and biomass, which barely account for 15 percent of Minnesota's energy consumption.  Picture a family in Ely, Minnesota, where wind chill temperatures reached 71 below zero this January, waking up in a warm house heated by natural gas.  They start a hot pot of coffee, powered by our affordable electric grid; take a hot shower, again, heated by natural gas; drive their kids to school in their van, powered by reliable, affordable gasoline; go to work, possibly at a mine or a local hospital; drive home again in that same gasoline-powered car; make dinner for their family, using their gas-powered stove; and then wake up again and do it all over.  The little things that we take for granted every day are powered by conventional energy.  The Green New Deal would have a severe impact on our everyday lives, something that northern Minnesotans do not want or need.  The Green New Deal would force every Minnesota family to turn in their cars for electric vehicles and retrofit their homes to run on renewable sources, like solar or wind.  I understand elites from D.C. and New York City may love this plan, but I know the reality. I encourage my colleagues, especially those who support this plan, to go back to their districts, like I did last week and really listen to their constituents, listen to their concerns, listen to how this plan would devastate the middle class and devastate hardworking Minnesota families.  Retrofitting homes, buying electric cars, and ending the mining, airline, and much of the shipping industries may be fun ideas for the ultra-wealthy, but I know what it really means for middle-class families in northern Minnesota.  We cannot let these unrealistic ideas get in the way of actual progress. We must develop renewable forms of energy, but at the same time, not shut out conventional, affordable energy sources on which millions rely.  Do not let the Green New Deal distract from what northern Minnesotans care about: expanding rural broadband for better internet access, bringing good paying jobs back to our communities, and protecting Social Security and Medicare.  With the projected cost of tens of trillions of dollars, the Green New Deal puts all of this at risk.  I will not risk the future of Medicare and Social Security. I will not risk the future of middle-class families. However, I will stand up for the farmers, our miners, our small business owners, manufacturers, and workers threatened by this Green New Deal."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Washington, for organizing this important Special Order on the Green New Deal.  Mr. Speaker, America's energy renaissance is the backbone of our economy. It is a story of freedom, prosperity, and opportunity.  After decades of reliance on other countries to meet our energy needs, the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects that America will export more energy than it imports starting in 2020. We are no longer dependent on volatile foreign sources produced in Russia or Saudi Arabia.  Recent innovation and technology improvements associated with fracking and horizontal drilling have allowed shale resources, previously deemed uneconomical, to be developed, and are the main reason the U.S. was the world leader in carbon emissions reductions in 2015, 2016, and 2017.  That is right. Fracking, demonized by environmental extremists without justification, has proven to be the best energy solution for our environment.  Abundant oil and natural gas has reduced electricity bills, kept gas prices low, and provided the largest share of U.S. electric power generation in recent years.  The oil and gas industry supports more than 10.3 million jobs and nearly 8 percent of our economy.  The United States is the world's top energy producer, and the American Dream is thriving.  January 2019 saw the hundredth consecutive month of positive jobs growth in America, the longest period of continuous jobs growth on record.  The U.S. job market is strong, and in December, employers posted 7.3 million open jobs, a new record.  Now, despite America's energy renaissance and the aforementioned emissions reductions, we continue to hear hyperbolic statements about pending climate catastrophe and the need for radical change to stave off future disaster.  The Democrat socialists pushing the Green New Deal want to get rid of all energy sources except wind, solar, and batteries by 2030. How are we going to do that when wind and solar only produced 7.6 percent of our electricity in 2017?  The Green New Deal would drive energy production and jobs to countries like China and India that have much worse environmental standards. Global greenhouse gas emissions will increase as a result, in direct contradiction to the main talking point of the Green New Deal.  The socialist Green New Deal says it will provide higher education, higher quality healthcare, and affordable, safe, and adequate housing to all. The Mercatus Center estimates that the cost of the single-payer healthcare provision alone would cost $32 trillion in the first 10 years, something that I think is probably on the low side.  The Green New Deal is an alarmist pipe dream that seeks to fundamentally transform America without a blueprint. This socialist manifesto changes by the day, and important details on how a transition of the Green New Deal's magnitude will occur are missing, including how we will pay for this pie in the sky aspiration.  If one needs to have more evidence that the Green New Deal is not plausible, look no further than the country of Australia where electricity prices are the highest in the world and the Aussies' obsession with renewables has destroyed their electric grid. Mass blackouts and mass power cuts are the new norm, and a massive Tesla battery backup system ran dry this past month as the Aussie power grid crashed in summer temperatures. Ninety thousand Aussie homes had no air-conditioning for the next 2 weeks of blistering heat.  Let's learn from Australia's mistakes. Let's not repeat them.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to enlightening everyone on this legislation further in the coming days."

Mr. Speaker, many of my constituents continue to ask me what is actually in this Green New Deal legislation. Unfortunately for the American people, the Members of Congress who introduced the resolution had, I guess, several hiccups along the way during their rollout and released conflicting documents to accompany the bill.  One significant piece of legislation that my constituents have asked me about is whether the related resolution mandated a job for everyone in the United States. Well, that is, in fact, true. A part of the frequently asked questions document that was released with the legislation even stated that economic security would be provided for those who are ``unwilling to work.'' Many of my constituents think that is an amazing statement.  After an adviser to the Green New Deal accused Republicans of doctoring this document, The Washington Post later reported that he erroneously made that accusation. In fact, this document was released by Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez's office.  Representative Ocasio-Cortez has since retracted the frequently asked questions document, but the message I hope my constituents and the American people hear clearly is that we know the motives behind this legislation. We know the intent. From ending the airline industry to shutting down all nuclear power, unfortunately, some people on the other side of the aisle, my colleagues on the Democratic side, are threatening the American economy.

Here is what we need to understand about this. This is so broad and expansive, as Mr. Newhouse has said, it will, basically, invade every aspect of every American's life, and it will cost tens of trillions of dollars to implement.  How will we pay for that? We are going to pay for that with crushing new taxes on individuals, families, and companies. We are going to destroy the current foundation of our entire American economy.  There will be more borrowing, not just from the public sector, but from the private sector. The public sector is in trouble because the Federal Government just hit $22 trillion of national debt.  The question is, what will the impact of this be on the environment? It would do little to solve the alleged problem of carbon in the atmosphere because the United States is no longer the primary source of carbon emissions.  Between 2005 and 2017, our Nation has reduced CO2 emissions by 862 million tons. Today, the U.S. is responsible for only 15 percent of global CO2 emissions. During roughly the same period, China increased its emissions by 4 billion tons and India by 1.3 billion tons.  Needless to say, the GND doesn't explain how we would compel other nations to change their behavior. But domestically, as I have said, we are going to emasculate our economy. The coal, nuclear, natural gas, petroleum, and air travel industries will be wiped out, and all of the industries that support those industries. That means hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs almost instantly.  At the same time, the Green New Deal, or the green socialist manifesto, is going to guarantee a wage. It is going to guarantee income for everyone.  As Representative Ryan said, we can't green the economy without the power of the free market system. He is right. That is the ultimate point of what I want to say today.  We know that science doesn't support the green socialist manifesto, but we know something that is really critical to understand. This proposal, which today is so vast, so encompassing, and so primitive in its creation, is also so destructive to our economy and multiple industries, multiple sectors of our economy, that I would say there is only one way that you can implement such an outlandish and reckless idea, and that is to use the awesome, overreaching power of government to not just induce, but to coerce implementation of this faulty idea.  In its scope, breadth, and depth, this plan is authoritarian in nature. It will require government flexing its muscles to mandate activities and forbid other actions in every American's life.  We can't afford this plan. This plan will not provide what it says it is going to do. Moreover, in a free, constitutional Republic, you can never allow this kind of socialism to be combined with authoritarianism."

Mr. Speaker, I must admit that, back home, the Green New Deal means that John Deere dealers are having a new combine sale.  I stand before you this evening to tell you exactly why the Green New Deal is a sham. Rather than setting realistic goals to reduce carbon emissions and incentivize cleaner energy development, this so-called deal stalls innovation and drastically expands government involvement in almost every aspect of everyday life, at a price tag of more than $50 trillion.  Over the past 2 years, we have unleashed our economy by reducing government overregulation, allowing more Americans to invest in their families, futures, and pursuits. The Green New Deal will throw the brakes on our economy, as well as the world's economy. Nothing will increase worldwide carbon production more than a stalled economy.  Additionally, this Green New Deal reverses our success by imposing harsher regulations that will put American workers and American companies at an extreme disadvantage. This socialist proposal that Democrats are championing completely ignores the cost to American taxpayers and fails to address the negative impacts that other countries have on global climate change. It implements policies that will dramatically increase taxes, burdens, and energy bills for families.  This deal will absolutely devastate our economy with its outrageous demands for new green infrastructure, new green labor practices, and new green taxes. It will crush American manufacturing and transportation industries. It would completely halt domestic energy production that has had record exports under the Trump administration.  I am a firm believer that we must focus on leaving this world better than we found it for the next generation. For my children, for your children, and for our grandchildren, we need to be good stewards of the resources and the planet we have been given, but any reasonable solution will require us to use common sense when approaching the issues.  We must also be careful not to fall into the trap of believing that the U.S. Government is the answer to correct all our problems. America has always been a nation of innovators, and instead of imposing new regulations and taxes, we must continue to lead the world and partner with American industries to develop creative solutions and new innovative technologies. Innovation will do more to impact climate change than any law Washington, D.C., can write.  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Marshall for sharing with us his thoughts from the great State of Kansas.  Some of the proponents of the Green New Deal have criticized others for criticizing the Green New Deal, saying that we don't have any room to talk if we are not going to offer something toward the issues that we face as a world and as a country.  Let me just say, Mr. Speaker, we do have options, and we do have solutions that we have been offering. Let me share a piece written by my Republican colleagues just recently who lead the Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr.   Greg Walden, Mr. Fred Upton, and Mr.   John Shimkus shared an article that was published in several newspapers around the country. Some of the things that they say go like this: ``America's approach for tackling climate change should be built upon the principles of innovation, conservation, and adaptation. Republicans have long championed realistic, innovative, and free-market strategies to promote a cleaner environment and to reduce emissions. The results are clear: The United States is leading the world in reducing greenhouse gas emissions thanks to vibrant energy sector competition and innovation.''  They go on to say: ``We should continue to encourage innovation and renewable energy development. We should promote carbon capture and utilization, renewable hydropower, and safe nuclear power, which is emissions-free. We should also look to remove barriers to energy storage and commercial batteries to help make renewable sources more viable and our electricity grid more resilient. And we must encourage more research and business investments in new clean energy technologies. These are bipartisan solutions that we must seize on to deliver real results for the American people.''

Just days ago, we passed $22 trillion in debt for which we have no plan to begin paying off. The Green New Deal would only add trillions more while simultaneously destroying the American economy, which not only means families across our Nation would lose their ability to sustain themselves, but it would also shut down the innovation engine of the world.  The 27th District of Texas, which I represent, has a better approach. We are home to a diverse energy portfolio, which includes wind, nuclear, LNG, oil production--not to mention our fair share of cows and airplanes.  We are home to a safe, reliable nuclear power plant in Matagorda County that generates 2.7 gigawatts of power, and that is a power of nearly 2 million Texas homes and businesses. It would take 8.4 million solar panels to replace that kind of energy. Even President Obama's Secretary of Energy said, ``It's just impractical.''  We are also home to the leading export energy port in the Nation. We have been a great part in the success of what we have seen as a nation of going from an energy-dependent nation to an energy-dominant nation. And what that new American energy dominance means, it means global stability and peace in the world as our allies are able to buy energy from us rather than from countries who don't have our best intentions in mind.  But as the world's need for energy grows, American companies are more likely to care about being good stewards of our creation compared with those from other energy-producing nations.  The United States cut carbon emissions by 14 percent since 2005 while global emissions rose 26 percent over the same period. Of all the G20 countries, we have the best record recently on carbon emissions and reductions.  In Texas our market-based approach to energy is leading the way even as our economy continues to boom. Furthermore, a thriving economy is absolutely essential to creating and deploying the innovative solutions we need to face the environmental challenges of the future.  So when it comes to the Green New Deal, let's stop looking to socialism for answers and start looking to places like Texas.  This Green New Deal would be devastating to American jobholders, harmful to our allies around the world, and it is also counterproductive to advancing protections to our environment.

You know, this outrageous proposal would be a massive government takeover of every facet of our daily lives. From how we eat, to how we travel, this so-called Green New Deal calls to replace every building and car in America within 10 years. It would cost up to $93 trillion. That would cost every American household an extra $65,300 per year.  That might be crumbs in New York and California, but it is not in Kansas, where the average family income is $56,422.  If the crushing tax increase on every family isn't bad enough, the plan also calls for an eventual end to air travel.  As representative of the Air Capital of the World, clearly, this is alarming.

Grounding air travel would decimate jobs in Kansas, just as the entire Green New Deal would devastate the economy of our country.  The only thing this proposal accomplishes is exposing the priorities of politicians who are determined to increase taxes and expand government to impose their agenda on every family, farm, and business.  Kansans know how to protect our environment and quality of life without being told to do so by government officials in Washington, D.C., and I stand with them in opposing this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Newhouse for leading this special order."

I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts about the Green New Deal and the impacts it would have on our country--something that we just absolutely cannot afford. So I appreciate very much his time this evening, and I thank him.  Mr. Speaker, I recently read an article from Reuters titled ``Labor Unions fear Democrats' Green New Deal poses job threat.''  I didn't write that title. That is what they did. In it, a spokesman for a major union in this country speaks on the legislation's language, calling for a transition for union jobs. He says, ``We've heard words like `just transition' before, but what does that really mean? Our Members are worried about putting food on the table.''  Another labor union, the Laborers' International Union of North America states, ``We will never settle for `just transition' language as a solution to the job losses that will surely come from some of the policies in the resolution.''  Mr. Speaker, hardworking Americans across the country deserve to be heard. Unfortunately, as this article states, neither union was contacted for input before the legislation was released.  And with that, Mr. Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from California's First District (Mr. LaMalfa), my good friend and a fellow farmer. "

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, thank you to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).  Indeed, what we know so far about the Green New Deal, it is more like a green pipe dream. It would lead to a total government takeover of just about every aspect of our lives.  Now, it is interesting to watch, since the deal was proposed not that many days ago, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, many of them are starting to back away from it. There were 67 coauthors on that. We are seeing some starting to back away, saying, well, this really isn't the dream or the deal; it is more of an aspiration.  Well, by the time you freaked out half the country with these ideas that you put into legislation, maybe we need a little more heads-up on what really is the goal here.  Some of the guarantees in it:  A government paycheck for those unwilling to work.  Is that really in there? What are we talking about here?  The cost of this implementation? $93 trillion, quadruple of what our national debt is right now. The cost will be passed on, of course, to--as always--the taxpayer, to families, to those struggling--especially middle-income folks--who could see their energy bills going up from already at a high point to an additional $4,000 annually per family.  We should really have our supporters of this bill benefit from the lessons learned in California on the high-speed rail boondoggle that tripled in a short amount of time soon after it was barely approved, $10 billion by the taxpayers to a nearly $100 billion project, all under the guise of saving greenhouse gases.  Except during the construction of the high-speed rail in California, it will make a whole bunch of greenhouse gases with the equipment involved, so we are going to plant trees to offset that. Yet, at the same time, they are running the rails through hundreds of acres of almond trees in the middle of California that they are supposed to be offsetting.  It is a reckless attempt to undermine America's increasing dominance--not just energy independence--but now dominance in energy around the world.  It ignores the basic reality; a lot of what America was built upon were indeed fossil fuels, those known reserves that we have in this country.  Now, let's talk a little bit about the Paris accord that I think President Trump rightfully withdrew the United States from. The goal being greenhouse gas reduction, CO2 reduction.  Well, when you look at the stats, who is already leading the way outside of the accord? The U.S.--of those western countries--is the only one that has actually reduced its number of CO2 in that amount of time.  We are the ones doing it. You know why? Because we have freedom; because we have the ability to innovate here, to invent the new technology, to invent the things that are going to help us do things better and cleaner into the future.  I don't hear a lot of talk on this about new hydropower, which is clean and ready to go any time you turn on the switch to the gates to allow the turbines to flow.  Biomass. In my area of the country--the Western Caucus, my colleagues here--we burn part of the west every year. We should be putting that fuel into clean burning power plants to make electricity, cleaning our forest, making it more fire-safe, better for the wildlife, better for the environment, not having all that CO2 go up. And then creating jobs in our backyard to get people to work from cleaning up the over-inventory the U.S. forest and BLM has from allowing their forest to run rampant with no management for the last 100 years.  These are things we should be talking about, not this green dream thing. Instead, we are going to hear nothing but climate change, climate change, climate change, with solutions that just harness or handcuff the economy, the jobs, and the people of this country inside this chamber and in the real world out there where people actually produce things.  We need to focus on the things that we know can work, producing energy with hydropower. Yes, with nuclear power, no emissions. With biomass, help clean that inventory that burns hundreds of thousands of acres every year of forest land, and put it to work for us.  That is what we are going to be successful at, because the United States is always number one in developing the new technology, the new ways to do cleaner, better, more efficiently, instead of handcuffing our economy and that innovation and exporting it somewhere else.  I do agree with my colleagues that have spoken here tonight. And in sending the message, we need to strongly oppose this bill and get back to something that actually works for the working people of this country.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the time of the gentleman."

I appreciate very much him sharing his thoughts--and California's thoughts--about what we have in front of us and the impact it would have.  And if anyone is thinking that this is just a bunch of Republicans that are thinking this way and have these thoughts, let me share with you some quotes from some of my friends across the aisle, Mr. Speaker.  Representative Jeff Van Drew, a Democrat from New Jersey. He says of the Green New Deal, ``It is not a serious policy proposal. It seeks the complete reorganization of American society, which took hundreds of years to build, in a matter of 10 years.''  Or the senior Senator from California--Mr. LaMalfa's state--just stated last week that ``There's no way to pay for it.''  From my own State, my colleague, Representative Rick Larsen just said recently, ``It is difficult to support the resolution right now when one of the lead sponsors says one of the intentions is to make air travel unnecessary.'' He is the chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Aviation.  My neighbor from Oregon, Mr. DeFazio, chairman of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, said, ``The idea that in 5 or 10 years we're not going to consume any more fossil fuels is technologically impossible. We can have grand goals, but let's be realistic about how we get there.''  Even our own Speaker of the House, Ms. Pelosi from California, said of the proposal, ``The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it, right?''  So you can see, it is not just us, this is a bipartisan feeling about the Green New Deal that it needs a lot more consideration.  Mr. Speaker, at this point, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Norman), my good friend from the Palmetto State, Fifth District, and a member of the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology."

And I rise to oppose the Green New Deal for many of the reasons that have already been said, but this is the most amateurish resolution that has come before this Congress in a long time, not from only my point of view but many others who have served longer than I have.  We were asked to consider a policy that would change every aspect of American life, deciding what we eat, how we travel, how we stay warm, and even what jobs we can take and what homes we are allowed to live in.  We are presented with a total overhaul of society, but with no explanation how. There is no roadmap, no method of implementation, and, of course, no price tag. All we know is that this will be dictated by a cabal of better-knowing bureaucrats. Yet every estimate shows just how unrealistic this green deal really is.  According to the American Action Forum, the total cost could run as high as $93 trillion over 10 years. This totals 21 times our current Federal budget of $4.4 trillion. That can only mean one thing for the American people: taxes, taxes, and more taxes.  This resolution is so lacking in detail, we might as well vote on the merits of a scrap of paper that says, ``solve the problem.'' This is no way to govern. The only details we do have are from a survey that enjoyed a brief existence online before it was removed out of embarrassment and has since been denied.  One source of embarrassment was the call to get rid of cows. To my knowledge, this is the first time that a Member of this House has called for bovine genocide.  That the deal's supporters are now hiding these facts reveals that the true agenda behind the Green New Deal is too horrifying to be shared with any of the public. As a rule of thumb, any law that cannot be shared with the people cannot serve the people.  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina for his input on this important issue. It underscores the cost to the Nation if this were adopted and its impact on our economy. I thank the gentleman for that tremendous help.  I thank all my colleagues, members of the Congressional Western Caucus, for participating tonight to point out some of the fallacies of the Green New Deal. Certainly, it is something that, as legislation is proposed, this is the process: We talk about what we like, what we don't like, and we offer alternatives, trying to find solutions in a bipartisan way.  Republicans have always advocated to continue looking at these issues of climate change, of energy use and production, of issues facing the environment. We are always looking for ways to innovate, to adequately fund research, but, basically, underscoring all of that, relying on the use of sound science for any decisions that we make, to make sure that the policies that we adopt are those that will be sustaining and good for not only our country, but for the world.  So we base our decisions on science, not politics. As Republicans, as members of the Congressional Western Caucus, which is a bipartisan organization, we look forward to debating seriously and making serious decisions in regard to these very important issues that face our country, face the next generation, and face the world.  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing debates on this important topic, and I yield back the balance of my time."

Dr. Lacey made an indelible mark on our communities by tirelessly serving those at the margins. Across Lake County, children in need, the homeless, and inmates and their families directly benefited from her generosity and boundless energy.   Dr. Lacey broke multiple barriers throughout her life. She was born to humble beginnings, as one of ten children in rural Mississippi. At age 21 she moved to Florida to further her education, where she met her late husband William, and eventually settled in his hometown of Waukegan. She found work as a contractor at Naval Station Great Lakes as well as handmaking elegant hats.   Never one to rest, she continued to study and was ordained a pastor, became a foster parent, and earned a certificate in social work.   In Waukegan, her memory lives on as the namesake of Mary's Mission, a homeless shelter she founded that has provided shelter to hundreds of individuals in times of need, and has helped them develop the job training and skills they need to get back on their feet and live independently.   Dr. Lacey was also a fierce advocate for children, bringing joy to young residents during the holidays. She teamed up with the Waukegan police department to start a toy giveaway program for children who might not receive a gift during the holidays. I had the privilege to join several of her annual Christmas parades from Mary's Mission to the Lake County jail, where she handed out turkeys and toys.   Her perseverance in helping vulnerable people, touched and improved the lives of countless Illinoisans. Dr. Lacey truly lived her faith every day, and she will be sorely missed. I extend my heartfelt condolences to her many family and friends who are mourning her passing."

Nick is the grandson of Judge John Gray, who took up a homestead in the Shavano Valley in 1884, became Mayor of Montrose, and received local acclaim for working to get the Gunnison Tunnel built during his time as a District Judge. Judge Gray's son, Joe Gray, was Nick's father. Nick grew up on the family ranch his grandfather built with his mother Addie Hobson, his father, and the rest of his siblings .  In 1940, Nick left his family's ranch and volunteered to serve in the Army. He was stationed at Pearl Harbor with the 25th Infantry Division when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. While overseas he built roads and bridges on Guadalcanal in the South Pacific and managed a crew of 25 natives who had been bombed out by Japanese forces. After his service was complete, he used his military education to build his ranching operation back home in Colorado and ultimately created the Nick Gray Construction Company.  As a small business owner, he built more than 3,000 miles of power line rights-of-way and roads across three states. In 1963, Nick cleared 220 miles for power line structure sites, building sub-station sites and roads from Wyoming to New Mexico. Another one of Nick's major accomplishments was building the Purgatory Ski Area near Durango, Colorado. Nick built the parking lot, ski course, and by-pass road all the way to Hermosa Park. During the 129-day project, he blasted nearly 40,000 yards of rock.  Nick married his wife Margaret in June 1946, and they had a son, Stephen Gray. Nick and Margaret have two granddaughters, Nicole Lumsden and Lezlee Cox, and six great-grandchildren, Keith Lumsden, Stephen Lumsden, Sarah Lumsden, Talli Lumsden, Caralea Cox, and Kendyl Cox.

This push for Korean independence from Japan would begin in Seoul on March 1, 1919 and spread throughout the country.  Over 100 years ago, the Korean people were inspired by former Governor of New Jersey and United States President Woodrow Wilson's ideas of self-determination to resist the occupation of Japanese military rule. This revolutionary spirt was aided by release of a Korean Declaration of Independence that was written by 33 core activists in the Samil Movement. The declaration was read by the leaders in the Seoul and in townships throughout Korea by supporters of the movement.  Attempts by the Japanese military to suppress the Samil Movement's peaceful gatherings gave their followers a stronger will to keep demonstrating. It is estimated that approximately two million Koreans participated in more than 1,500 demonstrations for independence. Several thousand were massacred, wounded and arrested by the Japanese police force and army in what is known as the Bloody History of the Korean Independence Movement. These acts became the catalyst for the Korean Independence Movement that would help unify the Korean people in their quest for independence in 1945.  Our alliance with the Republic of Korea has always been firm. Korea has remained one of the United States' closest and most steadfast allies and partners. Our shared belief in self-determination is pivotal to our joint success. I am proud to rise today to honor that history.

Notably, while providing this crucial and costly support, Azerbaijan has still taken significant and impressive strides to improve economic development in their region.  Indeed the Government of Azerbaijan has not only contributed to regional stability, but has continued to be a reliable ally for the United States in combating terrorism around the world. In the days after September 11, 2001, Azerbaijan quickly conveyed its solidarity with the American people and provided crucial assistance to our fight against terrorism by granting unconditional clearance to our military to use Azerbaijan's airspace as part of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.

In 2013, I hired Dillon to serve as a Field Representative in my Apple Valley District Office, where he worked with federal agencies like Social Security and the Export-Import Bank to answer constituent questions, represented me at events in the High Desert community, and helped manage my social media accounts. In February of 2018, Dillon was recruited and hired by ComAv Asset Management to develop international business relationships within the commercial aircraft industry. Dillon has consistently exceeded his monthly sales quota in his region, and has also developed sales processes for a team of 17 sales staff to help them meet and exceed their sales goals. In his personal life, Dillon has a love of inside jokes and wishes to be a part of one someday.  Dillon was one of the best employees I have had, and it was a pleasure to have him on my staff. On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I congratulate Dillon on his entrepreneurial spirit and his admission to the Young Alumni Hall of Fame"

Morin as a technology policy leader and champion of the Silicon Valley innovation ecosystem who retired from Applied Materials on February 1, 2019 after representing the company for more than 23 years in Washington, D.C.  With a history degree from Pennsylvania State University, Mr. Morin chose to launch his career in the service of our nation. He trained intensively as an Arabic linguist and intelligence analyst in the U.S. Army and was posted to the Presidio in Monterey. This gave Bill his first taste of California and forged lifelong links to the region that would become Silicon Valley. Following four years of service in the military, he joined the National Association of Manufacturers where he worked to create American jobs by advancing intellectual property, trade and technology policy.  In 1996, Bill joined the small team of R. Wayne Sayer and Associates, one of the first Washington firms specializing in issues to support the rapidly expanding U.S. high technology industry and began to represent Applied Materials. In 2002, he opened and led Applied's first direct office in Washington, D.C. Over the years, he advocated for public policy that would allow high-tech manufacturers like Applied to maintain a strong footprint in the United States while accessing fast-growing overseas markets and reinvesting in the innovation and R&D that would ensure American leadership in technology. The policies he advocated for on behalf of Applied Materials helped it develop into a major U.S. manufacturer and exporter, a world leader in materials engineering solutions and a model Silicon Valley corporate citizen.  Madam Speaker, upon Bill's departure from our nation's capital, he has wisely chosen to spend his retirement in California, returning to the shores of Monterey Bay where he began his career. I congratulate Bill on his retirement, for his service to our country and for his service to Applied Materials where his contributions helped open the world's markets to the innovations of Silicon Valley."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of Americans affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue disorders in observance of February as Marfan Awareness Month.  Marfan syndrome is a rare genetic condition. About 1 in 5,000 Americans carries a mutation in gene called fibrillin which results in an overproduction of a protein called transforming growth factor beta or TGFB. The increased TGFB impacts connective tissue and since connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome features can manifest throughout the body. Patients often have disproportionately long limbs, a protruding or indented chest bone, curved spine, and loose joints. However, it is not the outward signs that concern Marfan syndrome patients, but the effects the condition has on internal systems. Most notably, in Marfan patients the large artery, known as the aorta, which carries blood away from the hemi is weakened and prone to enlargement and rupture, which can be fatal. It is for this reason that increased awareness of Marfan syndrome can save lives.  I am proud to represent The Marfan Foundation, which is headquartered in Port Washington. The Marfan Foundation is the nation's foremost organization working to raise awareness of Marfan syndrome and supporting the marfan community. The Marfan Foundation has worked tirelessly to improve the lives of individuals affected by Marfan syndrome and related connective tissue conditions by advancing research, raising awareness, and providing support.  While there is currently no cure for Marfan syndrome, efforts are underway to enhance our understanding of the condition and improve patient care. I applaud the National Institutes of Health, particularly the National, Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases for their research efforts in this regard. I encourage NIH to expand research efforts in this area.  Early diagnosis and proper treatment are the keys to managing Marfan syndrome and living a full life. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting a Marfan education and awareness program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We can facilitate proper treatment by raising awareness leading to early diagnosis. I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing February as Marfan Awareness Month."

This is such an important cause and we are glad to bring awareness to promote good oral health for children. Tooth decay is the number one chronic infectious disease among children in the U.S. The impact of not treating decay can lead to other bad outcomes beyond just oral health. The Congressional Oral Health Caucus is pleased to support National Children's Dental Health Month and any activities taking place throughout the month of February.  Give Kids A Smile, which is sponsored by the ADA Foundation, is at the center of National Children's Dental Health Month. Give Kids a Smile day is such an important event for all children and dentists throughout the country. Because of this program, the ADA Foundation is able to provide assistance to more than 6,000 dentists and 57,000 dental team members, and other volunteers who proudly give their time and effort to make a difference in the health of children. Since this program has started, volunteers have graciously provided services to over 5.5 million kids across the country, and to all 50 states as well. They have truly made a huge impact in their communities and improved the oral health of so many children.  Throughout National Children's Dental Health Month, dentists and dental team members across the country will be providing oral health services for children in need, and this will continue throughout the year. These services will include oral health education, screenings, preventive care and restorative services. Some will provide this in their own dental practice, others will go right into schools and the community to reach the kids that need it most. There are also many major events at dental hygiene schools where hundreds of kid may receive oral health services.  Continued public awareness on this issue is so critical. On behalf of the Congressional Oral Health Caucus, I would once again like to state our full endorsement for the month, and push for continued care for good oral health of children."

In all my years of service, I have yet to meet more caring and tireless advocates.  Their advocacy is important because of the number of people kidney disease affects--nearly one in three adults are at risk of developing kidney disease. Nearly thirty million Americans have kidney disease and approximately ninety percent don't even know it. It sneaks up on you and that's why raising awareness is a key component to combating this disease and ultimately saving lives.  Sadly, on October 10, 2018, we lost one of our great advocates and champions--our friend Bill Hahn of Rockledge, Florida, passed away. Bill was one of those unspoken heroes who got up every morning and fought to keep going, for himself, and so many other people struggling with kidney disease, recovering from transplant surgery and waiting to receive the special gift of life.  From an early age, Bill believed in physical fitness and leading a very active and healthy life. As a young man he was a male model and later a professional surfer with the famous Salick surf team winning numerous awards. A graduate of Florida State University, he owned and operated a successful health fitness business selling exercise equipment in Melbourne, Florida. Even with his dedication to a daily exercise regiment, at the age of twenty-six, Bill was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.  Living with Diabetes can be a difficult struggle, even for someone as physically fit as Bill Hahn. Over time the disease began to take a toll on Bill's health as he suffered from many of its complications including blindness, nerve damage and even coma. Unfortunately, Bill suffered renal failure at age fifty-one, but his physical routine never stopped. When Bill was on dialysis, he was walking ten miles a day. And because of his fitness level, he was a good candidate for transplant surgery. On New Year's Eve 2008, Bill received a true gift of life--a new kidney and pancreas.  Since his surgery, Bill dedicated his life to helping patients struggling with kidney disease and other serious medical conditions. In 2012 he joined with surfing legend and fellow transplant recipient Rich Salick and co-founded the annual Cocoa Beach ``Footprints in the Sand'' Kidney Walk. Katie and I have been involved in the Kidney Walk each year and it continues to grow and draw participation from all over Central Florida thanks in large part to Bill's work and other volunteers from our community.  Bill was a constant advocate for this cause, especially in the last years of his life. And, if you knew Bill Hahn, helping others is what kept him going. He worked closely with my office on various projects throughout the years and brought to my attention many important pieces of legislation moving through Congress that are critical to winning this battle. In 2017 Bill lead a successful effort to declare May 13th ``Living Kidney Donor Day'' in the State of Florida. He is also the author of three books including More Than A Conqueror Legacy, a spiritual healing guide for patients; The Silver Lining, a chronicle of Bill's journey through recovery; and The Window Box, a book of poetry.  I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives to join me in recognizing the efforts of Bill Hahn and the many other Americans who have worked tirelessly to raise awareness about kidney disease and advocate for patients in need."

He always worked towards leaving the Huntsville community better than he found it.  Ila Martinez was Andy's wonderful wife of over 63 years and was not only a devoted partner to him, but was a loving mother and active in the community as well. A leading member of the Republican Party of Walker County, Ila was involved in the Red Hat Ladies and the Calendar Girls, a group of friends from Conroe High School that would meet once a month at lunchtime. Ila had a great love for volunteering and was often working with the Walker County Republican women or at her church library. Ila was a doting grandmother and her greatest pleasure was teaching her beloved granddaughters how to sew and bake.  Andy and Ila had two daughters, Andrea Scott and the late Debbie Martinez, and a son, Russell Martinez. Andy and Ila are survived by Andrea and her husband Wayne; their son, Russell; two beautiful grandchildren, Angela Stacks and husband Jared; Mika Spears and her husband Neal; and three great-grandchildren: Draper Stacks, Megan Anthony, and Trent Spears.  The legacy of Andy and Ila will always be a part of the Huntsville community, kept alive in the hearts of those who knew and loved them. Both were selfless servants dedicated to bettering the lives of those around them, and they will be greatly missed."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to introduce a bill to restore the partnership between the federal government and counties for the health care costs of inmates who have not been convicted of a crime. This legislation will provide some relief to our nation's local economies, while strengthening the fundamental principles of our justice system.  In almost all states, a person who is incarcerated in a county jail or juvenile detention facility loses their Medicare, Medicaid, CHIP or SSI benefits even if they have not been convicted of a crime. The U.S. Supreme Court's interpretation of the 8th Amendment requires government entities to provide medical care to all inmates. As a result, local governments are burdened with the expense of providing health care to thousands of men, women, and children currently awaiting trial.  Providing health care for inmates constitutes a major portion of local jail operating costs. Requiring county governments to cover health care costs for inmates who have not yet been convicted of a crime places an unnecessary burden on local governments, which have their fair share of widespread budget deficits and cuts to safety net programs and other essential services to deal with as it is.  Terminating benefits to inmates who are awaiting trial undermines the presumption of innocence, which is a cornerstone principle of our justice system. The current practice does not distinguish between persons who are awaiting disposition of charges and persons who have been duly convicted and sentenced. Moreover, this reality disproportionately affects low-income and minority populations who are often unable to post bond, which would enable them to continue receiving benefits.  Madam Speaker, my legislation addresses this problem by prohibiting the federal government from stripping individuals of their Medicare, Medicaid, and SSI benefits before the inmate has been convicted of a crime. It preserves the partnership between the federal and local governments and ensures that local governments are not burdened with an unfair share of meeting the constitutional mandate to guarantee medical coverage. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense bill that addresses a problem affecting communities all across the nation."

Judge Sugarmon died Monday after a long illness at the age of 89 but will be remembered forever as a crusading legal scholar who worked to end segregation in the Memphis public schools and for being a political genius who helped behind the scenes to elect the African American and progressive candidates who reshaped Memphis. In 1959, Sugarmon was one of the first African Americans to run for citywide office when he sought to be commissioner for public works. In 1966, he was elected to become Tennessee's second African American state representative since Reconstruction and was later elected a General Sessions Court judge after serving as a partner in Memphis' and Tennessee's first integrated law firm--Ratner, Sugarmon, Lucas and Willis. Other legendary attorneys such as Bill Caldwell, Irvin Salky, Troy Henderson, Walter Bailey, Jr., Russell X. Thompson and Tom Arnold hung their hats and licenses there. From 1976 to 1987, Judge Sugarmon was a referee in the Memphis Juvenile Court system, stepping down in May 1987 when he was appointed a General Sessions Court Judge. He was elected to the bench in 1988 and was reelected in 1990 and 1998. Russell Bertram Sugarmon, Jr. graduated from the city's Booker T. Washington High School in 1946 at the age of 15. Sugarmon spent a year at Morehouse College--in the class a year behind Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.--and transferred to Rutgers University, where he received his undergraduate degree in Political Science in 1950. He received his J.D. from Harvard University in 1953 and spent the following two years in the U.S. Army based mainly in Japan. After returning to the United States, he did further graduate studies at Boston University, then came back to Memphis in 1956 to establish a private legal practice. Judge Sugarmon worked tirelessly even when victory wasn't in the cards and kept the faith, knowing that it would come in time. He was one of the most learned strategists on politics and history in our community, avoiding the limelight but holding sway as the influential wise man behind the scenes in collaboration with a biracial and tolerant group of progressive leaders. Judge Sugarmon was a mentor, supporter and friend of mine my entire life and I am eternally grateful to have been so fortunate to have shared time with this remarkably knowledgeable, judicious and beloved man. Last year, Congress passed and the President signed into law my bill designating the post office at 1325 Autumn Avenue as the Russell B. Sugarmon Post Office. I had hoped Judge Sugarmon would be on hand for its dedication later this year but its existence will stand as a lasting physical monument to his stature in our city, in our state and in our nation. No one is more deserving. Supporting Russell Sugarmon's great work and providing encouragement and strength was the Sugarmon family. Russell was a beloved husband and father of six children, sadly preceded in death by his dear daughter Tina Spence. I extend my sincere condolences to his devoted wife and companion, Gina; his children Judge Tarik Sugarmon, Elena Williams, Erika Sugarmon, Monique Sugarmon and Carol Spence; his extended family and his many friends."

Presented annually, the Ellis Island Medals of Honor pay tribute to our Nation's immigrant heritage, as well as individual achievement. The Medals are awarded to U.S. citizens from diverse ethnic backgrounds who exemplify outstanding qualities in both their personal and professional lives, while continuing to preserve the richness of their particular heritage and culture. We honor these outstanding individuals because the important work they do today, creates a better world for all of us tomorrow. This momentous occasion was celebrated with a patriotic ceremony on Ellis Island and a recommitment by the leaders of the organization to their mission of honoring diversity, fostering tolerance and promoting religious and racial unity across America.  Since the Medals' founding, more than 2,500 American citizens have received the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, including seven American Presidents, numerous United States Senators and Congressmen, two Nobel Laureates, and many athletes, artists, clergy, and military leaders. This Medal is not about material success, nor is it about the politics of immigration; it is about the people who have committed themselves to this nation, embraced the opportunities America offers, and most importantly, who have used those opportunities to not only better their own lives but make a difference in our country and in the lives of its people.  Citizens of the United States hail from every nation known to man. The iconic metaphor of this nation as a veritable melting pot of cultures continues to ring true, and it is this diversity that adds to the unique richness of American life. It is the key to why America is the most innovative, progressive and forward thinking country in the world. The Ellis Island Medals of Honor not only celebrate select individuals but also the pluralism and democracy that enabled our forbearers to celebrate their cultural identities while still embracing the American way of life. This award serves to remind us all that with hard work and perseverance anyone can still achieve the American dream. In addition, by honoring these remarkable Americans, we honor all who share their origins and we acknowledge the contributions they have made to America. I commend National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations and its Board of Directors headed by Nasser J. Kazeminy, for honoring these truly outstanding individuals for their tireless efforts to foster dialogue and build bridges between different ethnic groups, as well as to promote unity and a sense of common purpose in our nation.  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the good works of NECO and in congratulating all of the 2018 recipients of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor.

This analysis concluded that largely because of intensive agriculture, and specifically heavy use of pesticides, over 40 percent of insect species are threatened with extinction. Furthermore, this analysis found that around 41 percent of all insect species have seen their populations decline over the last 10 years, and that 3.5 million of the United States honeybee colonies have been lost since 1947.  These alarming statistics foretell a catastrophic collapse of nature's ecosystems. Already we are seeing the impacts of the climate crisis wreak havoc on our natural world, public health and, importantly, our food system. Pollinators and other insects are vital to our economy and our livelihoods. One of every three bites of food we eat is from a crop pollinated by bees. This analysis is a call to action to do all we can to protect these valuable insects, particularly in the face of climate change.  That's why today I am introducing the Saving America's Pollinators Act. This legislation will suspend the use of certain insecticides until they are thoroughly assessed and determined to be safe for pollinators. Furthermore, it establishes a monitoring network for native bees, and clarifies the emergency exemption powers that this Administration is afforded under current law.  This law is much needed, and my hope is that with this new and alarming information, Congress can finally act to adequately protect our future food supply and agricultural and ecological health before it's too late."

Mr. Stallings was beloved by his community and went out of his way to improve the lives of others. Sadly, Mr. Stallings passed away on Friday, February 15, 2019 at the age of 83.  As a child, Mr. Stallings attended Nash County Training School in Nashville, North Carolina where he stood out as an excellent basketball player and athlete.  After graduating from high school, he attended Allen University in Columbia, South Carolina, where he met the love of his life, Bettye Bonner.  Mr. Stallings was drawn to a life of service from a young age. He was involved early in life at his church, Mount Vernon Missionary Baptist and, upon graduating from college, enrolled in the United States Army.  Later, Mr. Stallings continued to give back to his community by helping develop the next generation of Alabamians, working as a teacher in the Wilcox County School System at W. J. Jones High School, in Pine Apple, Alabama, and a teacher and basketball coach in the Dallas County Schools System at Tipton High School, in Selma, Alabama.  After many years of service in the Alabama public schools, Mr. Stallings transitioned to a role with the City of Selma, dedicating 27 years as the first African American Director of General Services. In that role, Mr. Stallings opened doors of opportunity for many young men and women to prosper.  One of Mr. Stalling's passions was DJing at WHBB Radio in Selma where he was fondly known as ``Big Jim.'' He quickly became known for gracing the airwaves with a variety of musical genres, including spiritual, soft rock and R&B music on his shows, ``The Spiritual Hour'' and the ``Jim Stallings Show.'' Mr. Stallings' music selections helped heal community divisions in the 1960s and laid the pathway for other aspiring African American DJs to enter the local radio scene.  Mr. Stallings' hobbies did not stop at the radio station, though. He was an honorary member of the Twelve High Club; a member of the Alabama Elks Lodge No. 1170 where he served for several years as the Exalted Ruler; an original member of the Tuesday Night Group; Director of the local Beauty and Talent; and the Alabama State Association of Elks; lead singer for Terry and the Fantastics; and a football announcer for the City of Selma and the Dallas County School systems.  While Mr. Stallings has passed from this life to the next, his legacy lives on in his devoted children, Anthony and Bonnie, his five grandchildren and many grand nieces and nephews, cousins, other relatives and friends.  On behalf of Alabama's 7th Congressional district and a grateful nation, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating Mr. Stallings' contributions to bettering the Selma community and our nation."

In all honesty, the fact that this legislation even needed to be written is a sad reminder of the degree to which our society is at risk of losing some crucial moral bearings, and the fact that the U.S. Senate could not even vote to advance this bill is beyond dismaying.  The legislation was silent on the abortion issue. All it would have done is to have affirmed the rights of these newborn babies, but apparently even that was a bridge too far, not just for the far-left fringe--not anymore--but for the vast majority of our Democratic colleagues right here in the Senate.  We are no longer dealing with a normal, traditional Democratic Party; we are looking at a party that has been dragged so far to the left, it would have been unrecognizable to folks just a few years ago. In 1996, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan condemned partial-birth abortion by comparing it to infanticide. He was a distinguished, mainstream Democratic Senator from New York about 20 years ago. And today? Ninety-four percent of Senate Democrats could not even vote to protect babies after they are born. The only explanations they could offer were bizarre euphemisms and vague references to issues that have no bearing once a child has already been born alive.  It was a sorry display, but I can say this: This fight isn't over. The Republicans will not let this stunning extremism from our Democratic colleagues be the last word on this subject."

                "speech":"Madam President, on a final matter, anyone who has been attentive to the news these past few days has learned about the complete debacle that unfolded in last November's election for North Carolina's Ninth Congressional District. Soon after election day, allegations of illegal ballot harvesting and vote tampering clouded a close result. The wrongdoing seemed to have benefited the Republican candidate over the Democratic. Just last week, we saw the State Board of Elections unanimously call for a new election.  For years and years, every Republican who dared to call for commonsense safeguards for Americans' ballots was demonized by Democrats and their allies. We were hit with leftwing talking points that insisted that voter fraud was not real--it never happens, they said--that fraud just didn't happen and that modest efforts to ensure that voters are who they say they are and are voting in the proper places were really some sinister, rightwing plot to prevent people from voting.  As you might expect, now that an incident of very real voter fraud has become national news and the Republican candidate seems to have benefited, these longstanding Democratic talking points have been really quiet. We haven't heard much lately from the Democrats about how fraud never happens. They have gone silent. Now some are singing a different tune. There is a new interest in ensuring the sanctity of American elections.  I have been focused for decades on protecting the integrity of elections, so I would like to welcome my friends on the left to their new realization. They have just discovered that this subject really matters, but I have yet to see any evidence that they are actually interested in cleaning up the conditions that lead to messes like this one in North Carolina.  At the root of the North Carolina debacle is a practice that is known as ballot harvesting. Essentially, it is a means by which campaign representatives can collect absentee ballots on the premise of delivering them to a polling place or an election office. That is what ballot harvesting is. So think about it. Who in American politics keeps long lists of potential voters? Who mobilizes networks of people to go door-to-door? Who funds and stands up to these kinds of canvassing organizations? Who does those things?  I am sorry to say that there are not huge teams of politically neutral Eagle Scouts who rove the country and hope to use ballot harvesting to politely make voters' lives more convenient. This is not an Eagle Scout activity. The folks who really lick their lips at the prospect of mass ballot harvesting are political operatives, of course--political operatives, interest groups, and one-sided political machines. This is why many jurisdictions, including in North Carolina, have outlawed the practice altogether. I will say that again. Many jurisdictions, including in North Carolina, have outlawed this practice altogether.  Ballot harvesting threatens to change the nature of our representative democracy. Forget about persuading people and spurring them to turn out to the polls; this practice makes elections a kind of scavenger hunt to see which side's operatives can return to headquarters with the most ballots in the trunks of their cars, and once those operatives take ahold of these ballots, the voters have no way to keep tabs on whether they were ever delivered.  Of course, a system that invites political operatives to be rewarded for turning up ballots will open the door to misbehavior. Remember, it is illegal in North Carolina and in most States for the obvious reason, but I have noted with interest that the Democrats' new focus on this practice has yet to extend to California. I wonder why. Well, in California, it is legal. It is a common practice in California. California allows anyone--not just family members but anyone--to show up at polling places on election day with ballots that are not theirs. Welcome to California.  Reports suggest that Orange County alone saw--listen to this--250,000 absentee ballots dropped off on election day last year. The county's registrar told the newspaper that some individuals dropped off hundreds of other people's ballots. We have no way to know if those ballots were sealed or if the people had even voted when they were harvested. The only evidence we have that the voter cast his or her ballot is the signature.  This past election cycle turned out favorably for California Democrats, amazingly enough. These late-arriving ballots seemed to help turn several races their way. Maybe this helps explain why: When House GOP leaders expressed concern over ballot harvesting in California, the State's Democratic secretary of state mocked their concern by saying: ``What they call strange and bizarre we call democracy.'' Now ballot harvesting has thrown out an election result in the U.S. House of Representatives--legal in California, illegal in North Carolina.  Maybe that helps explain why, as it stands, the Democrat Politician Protection Act--Speaker Pelosi's massive new Federal takeover of the way States and communities run their elections--contains no effort whatsoever to crack down on ballot harvesting. It is not in there. Instead, it contains provision after provision that would erode the protections that are supposed to ensure votes reflect the voices of the voters whose names are on the envelopes.  It contains provision after provision that would erode the protections that are supposed to ensure that votes reflect the voice of the voter whose name is on the envelope.  Provision after provision would erode commonsense protections and bring the guardrails down. So would a serious reform bill aimed to take away States' abilities to impose meaningful ID or signature requirements for voters. Would someone concerned about restoring democracy dismiss signature verification as an obstacle to be removed? I don't think so.  Perhaps these facts signal that Democrats see a political advantage in eroding commonsense protections and would rather keep that advantage than make episodes like the North Carolina mess less likely to happen in the future.  An example of real-live voter fraud is staring the country right in the face right now in North Carolina. Yet Democrats choose at this moment to propose a sprawling Federal takeover of election law that would erode the integrity of our elections even further.  So that, I think, pretty well underscores what the priorities of today's Democrat Party is."

                "speech":"Madam President, today, the House of Representatives will take up a motion to terminate the state of emergency proclaimed by President Trump. For many reasons, the measure should pass with bipartisan support.  First, Members of both parties know there is no actual emergency at the border. Nearly 60 former national security advisers--Democrat and Republican, bipartisan--including former Secretaries of State and Defense, have written a statement saying there is ``no factual evidence of an emergency at the border.'' The President himself said, when announcing the state of emergency, that he ``didn't need to do this.''  An emergency, by definition, is something you need to do. It is an emergency. In the President's own words, this is not a state of emergency.  If we let Presidents, whomever they be--Democrat or Republican--willy-nilly, because they want to get something done, just declare an emergency when it is clear it has been a long-term condition, a long-term issue, this country is a different country.  That leads to my second point. Members of both parties should be concerned about the President diverting money away from military construction projects in their districts.  Again, the President doesn't like you for some reason. He says there is an emergency and takes money away from a project in your State that you have worked hard for. That is no way to govern.  But at the top of the list is this: the Founding Fathers looking down upon this Chamber and upon these United States of America. They set up an exquisite balance of power. They were worried about an overreaching Executive. They knew what King George was all about. So they named the Congress, the House and Senate, the article I--article I, not II, III or IV--part of the government. Second, they gave the Congress one of the greatest powers any government has, which is the power of the purse.  When the President tries to take these powers away, which clearly he is doing in this case--he called for an emergency when he couldn't get his way in Congress, not because some new facts came on the scene--it is a change in the fundamental, necessary, and, often, exquisite balance of power.  I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle understand that. In fact, true conservatism worries about too much power being centralized in any place because conservatism exalts the freedom of the individual.  So to look the other way because Donald Trump wants this--because he is almost sometimes in a temper tantrum about this issue--is so short-sighted and is so detrimental to the long-term health, stability, and viability, even, of how the balance of power works.  So I implore my friends on the other side of the aisle to contemplate what it might portend for our democracy to allow this emergency declaration to stand. What would stop any future President from claiming an emergency every week and doing what they wanted--a total subversion of the balance of powers, a derogation of huge power to the Executive, which has plenty of power already?  The National Emergencies Act has been used only once in its relatively short history, and that was to take action after 9/11--clearly, an emergency. Now President Trump is trying to bend the law to his will, not to address a military emergency, not to address any real emergency. This has been an ongoing issue. He would say ``problem.'' That is OK, but he is doing it for personal political gain, to accomplish something Congress rejected and the American people oppose.  He has tried several times to get this wall. Congress has resisted. Congress even resisted when Democrats didn't have control of the House, and now they do. Elections do matter. We are a democracy, President Trump. So it is hard to imagine a more senseless and destructive use of emergency powers than what the President has proposed.  So let us, Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, rise to the occasion. This will be a moment in history, a point where things may turn a bit. If Congress stands up, it will be a reaffirmation of our democracy. It will be a reaffirmation of the democracy the Founding Fathers wanted. If Congress stands up--Democrats and Republicans--when the Founding Fathers look down on this Chamber after the vote occurs, they will smile because this is the democracy they wanted. They did not want a democracy where a President could simply declare an emergency on a whim and overrule what Congress has done.  So let us--Congress--first the House and then the Senate, speak up with one bipartisan voice to remedy this injury that President Trump is trying to do to our constitutional order.  Whatever you think of the best way to secure our border, this is not the way for a President--any President--to exercise his authority. This is not about whether you are for or against a wall, and I, of course, am against it. It is about what America is all about, whatever your view on the wall."

For years, Democrats have tried to address these loopholes--the gun show, online, and private sales loopholes--only to be met with lockstep resistance by a Republican Congress beholden to the NRA. It is 90 percent of Americans who favor strengthening the background check system, not 51, not 52, 90--the majority of Republicans, the majority of gun owners. Any way you slice it, Americans are strengthening background checks. Americans believe felons, spousal abusers, or those adjudicated mentally ill should not have guns, but Congress is paralyzed because of the other side's obeisance to the NRA--not even after Newtown, not even after Charleston, not even after Las Vegas, not even after Orlando, not after Parkland.  On guns, the tide is turning. Make no mistake about it, a strong majority of the American people support these policies now. The NRA has been considerably weakened. They did not do very well in the last elections. Finally, there is a House in Congress that will listen to the American people and take action on guns--thoughtful, moderate action on background checks.  With each measure that passes the House, the pressure will build on the Senate to take up these reasonable, commonsense gun safety measures, and I hope my colleagues will join us."

                "speech":"On another matter, buybacks. This morning, the New York Times reported on an interesting facet of the recent stock market rally. Many investors, according to the Times, are selling off stock. Average investors are selling off stock. Pensions, and mutual funds, nonprofits, endowments, private equity firms, and trusts are all, in the aggregate, selling stock.  So then why is it rallying? The laws of supply and demand should say the stock market should go down. The Times reports that it is corporate self-investment buybacks. Companies are buying back their own stock at such a rapid clip that they are propping up the market and, to a great degree, themselves. It is another clear example of how the recent explosion of stock buybacks in corporate America is distorting the market--artificially, some would argue.  Some Democratic Senators, and even some Republican Senators, have begun to sound the alarm about the recordbreaking scale of corporate buybacks. Over the last decade, based on analysis of America's largest corporations, 466 of S&P 500 companies, 92 cents out of every dollar of corporate profit has gone to share buybacks or dividends.  Some say, well, they have already, before the profits, put money into their workers and into their communities. We are saying they should put some more, for the good of the country. Stock price, when so much of it is held up by buybacks, shouldn't be the only indicia, the only measure, of how well the country is doing, especially when 85 percent of the stocks are owned by the top 10 percent of Americans.  Most Americans would completely agree that there are more productive ways for corporations to allocate their capital than this borderline obsession with stock buybacks--the slavery to short-term rises in price to please investors--while not doing much for workers or for communities.  I hope corporate America will wake up. Income inequality, along with climate change, to me, are the two greatest problems America faces. We need corporate America to propose some solutions because when they say let government do it, much of corporate America then opposes government doing anything for workers or for communities.  Let's take a careful look at this, and let's see what the right solutions are. The status quo is not acceptable."

Recently, we heard of a new effort by the Trump administration to once again push back against efforts to address climate change. You see, it was probably embarrassing for President Trump when his own administration released the National Climate Assessment last year, as required by law, which outlined the severe and immediate impacts of climate change. According to reports, the White House now has plans to set up a fake panel of cherry-picked scientists who question the severity of climate change in order to counter the scientific consensus on this terribly urgent problem, even within the administration. This new fake panel will reportedly be set up under the National Security Council, not the EPA, not NOAA, or any of the Agencies where real scientists work--real climate scientists.  This is maybe the most conspicuous symptom of the disease of climate denialism that has infected the Republican Party and the hard right. This is beyond willful ignorance. This is the intentional, deliberate sowing of disinformation about climate science by our own government. This cannot stand.  This morning, I am announcing that if the Trump administration moves forward with this fake climate panel, we will be introducing legislation to defund it. I will be doing it, along with several of my colleagues. It is long past time for President Trump and Republican leaders to admit that climate change is real, that human activity contributes to it, and Congress must take action to counter it.  So far, Leader McConnell and our Republicans, when we ask them, do you believe climate change is real? Silence. Do you believe humans cause it? Silence. Do you believe Congress has to act to deal with it? Silence. That will not stand, and they will not be able to maintain that position over a period of time."

An agreement that includes significant U.S. sanctions relief in exchange for something short of that will be woefully insufficient. It will make North Korea stronger and the world more dangerous, not safer.  To simply say to North Korea that we are going to let you continue to be nuclear in exchange for something else--a peace treaty or some words, a photo op--that is not protecting the security of the United States.  I remind my colleagues, Congress passed sanctions against the North Korean regime for its appalling record on human rights. Congress would need to repeal that law for President Trump to give North Korea reliable sanctions relief.  The North Koreans themselves should realize many of us in Congress will not, will not, will not--no matter what President Trump does, many of us in Congress will not remove this sanction relief until North Korea denuclearizes, verifiably and irreversibly.

                "speech":"Madam President, last night, for the second time in a month, Democrats objected to a bill to ban infanticide.  That statement to me is absolutely chilling, but for the second time in a month, Democrats objected to a bill that would do nothing more than state that a living, breathing baby born in an abortion clinic is entitled to the same protection and medical care as a living, breathing baby born in a hospital is entitled to.  It is a pretty basic bill. It just says that living, breathing, born human beings are entitled to protection even if they are born in an abortion clinic, but apparently that is not something Democrats are prepared to say. This is where Democrats' support for abortions has led them--to being unable to condemn infanticide.  Let's remember why we voted on this bill last night. We voted on this bill because the Democratic Governor of Virginia implicitly endorsed infanticide--because the Democratic Governor of Virginia got up and said that you could keep a living, breathing baby comfortable while you decided what to do with it.  There is only one answer to what you do with a living, breathing baby, and that is to provide it with the care it needs. A baby born alive in an abortion clinic is no less valuable and deserving of protection than a baby born in a delivery room.  It is horrifying that we are actually having a debate about this. Honestly, it is horrifying that the Democratic Party can't get up and say that infanticide is wrong. My Democratic colleagues like to talk about protecting the vulnerable, but how can they claim to care about helping those in need if they harden their hearts toward the most vulnerable among us? If they are willing to deny living, breathing babies basic medical care, do you really stand for the vulnerable if you can't stand up and say that infanticide is wrong?  It is terrible enough that we have so far betrayed our founding principles as to deny the right to life of living, breathing unborn babies, but we are not even talking about abortion here. We are talking about withholding essential care from babies who are born alive. My Democratic colleagues can't even bring themselves to say this is wrong.  I would say to my Democratic colleagues, do you really want to be the party of Governor Northam? Do you really want to be the party of infanticide?  The American people don't agree with the Democratic Party on abortion and on infanticide. Most Americans believe that babies born alive after an abortion should be provided with medical care. Most Americans think there should be at least some limits on abortion. In fact, most countries in the world think there should be some limits on abortion. The United States is just one of a tiny handful of countries that allow elective abortion past 20 weeks of pregnancy. Among the others on that list are China and North Korea--not exactly the company we want to be keeping when it comes to protecting human rights.  A recent poll found that 71 percent of Americans oppose abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Yet the Democratic Party is aggressively embracing an agenda of zero restrictions on abortion, ever, up to--and now, apparently, after--the moment of birth.  I hope last night is not the last time we vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. I hope my Democratic colleagues have a chance to recast their votes. I hope, next time, they will decide to vote against infanticide. I hope, next time, they can affirm what should be a basic, foundational principle, and that is that every baby, wherever he or she is born, deserves to be protected.  I yield the floor."

Since the Republicans are in control of the U.S. Senate, since there is a Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would suggest to my colleague that perhaps we have a hearing on this bill he just described. You see, it came to the floor yesterday without any hearing. And the reason why we need a hearing is that many of us--many of us--voted for an infanticide law, which is currently on the books--a law that says that a child needs to be protected and that those who don't protect that child are subject to criminal penalties, as they should be.  Now, if this is a different approach to it, doesn't it at least merit a hearing from the Republican majority before it comes to the floor for a vote? There are many questions I would like to ask of those who propose this. I want to understand why the law that has been on the books now for 17 years, as I remember, is inadequate to the challenges it faces.  I supported the infanticide law. I will continue to. If there are any changes that the Republicans want to make, is it too much to ask them to have a hearing in their own committee, which they chair, on this subject matter? I hope they will take it seriously enough to do it. Critics have said this has nothing to do with changing the law. It is just a ``gotcha'' vote on the floor--an amendment which may be used against candidates in future elections.  When it comes to children, something as serious as life and death should be taken much more seriously by the Republican majority."

                "speech":"Madam President, today is February 26. Eleven days ago, on Friday, February 15, an angry man with a history of violence and a Smith & Wesson .40 caliber pistol opened fire on his coworkers and police officers at a warehouse in Aurora, IL, about 40 miles from the city of Chicago.  In a matter of just a few minutes, five of this man's coworkers at the Henry Pratt Company were dead. He then shot and wounded five police officers who rushed to the scene. An hour and a half later, he died in an exchange of gunfire with other policemen.  The day before this horrible incident marked the anniversary of two other mass shootings: the 1-year anniversary of the Parkland, FL, shooting, which killed 17 high school students and staff, and the 11-year anniversary of a shooting at Northern Illinois University that left 5 students dead and 17 injured.  The gunman in the Henry Pratt warehouse massacre had just been told that day that he was going to be fired. His response was not just anger. His response was to pull out a firearm and murder five of his coworkers.  I want you to meet the victims of this man's violence. This is Trevor Wehner. Trevor was 21 years old. He was on the dean's list of Northern Illinois University's business college. He was on track to graduate this May.  Why was he at the Henry Pratt warehouse on that day? It was because he was on his first day of an internship at the business. Trevor was so excited about this opportunity to work at this business and to see what it was like to actually be in the real world that he showed up for his internship 45 minutes early that day. It was earlier than he should have. He was that excited. He died at the workplace that day.  This is Clayton Parks. He was known as ``Clay'' to his family and friends. He was the human resources manager at Henry Pratt. He was also an alumnus of Northern Illinois University. He had been working at the Henry Pratt Company for 4 months. He was 32 years old. He was married to his wife Abby and had a beautiful little 9-month-old baby boy, Axel.  I met them at Northern Illinois University when we held a vigil for Trevor and Clay that afternoon. I talked to Clay's mom for the longest time. She wanted to tell me his whole life story, hoping that she could preserve the memory of this wonderful young man and what he meant to her.  Russell Beyer is over here. I went to his memorial service. He had been at Henry Pratt for more than 25 years. He was a mold operator and was the father of two grown children. He was also the chairman of the union at Henry Pratt.  In a terrible twist of fate, Russell had helped the gunman get his job back when the company first fired him 2 months earlier. Last Thursday would have been Russell's 48th birthday. Instead of a birthday party, his family and friends gathered that day at his wake. As I went into the funeral home in Montgomery, IL, I was struck by this fact. It turns out that the family decided that since Russell was such a passionate football fan, everybody should wear NFL jerseys. The room was filled with members of his family remembering him and paying tribute to him by wearing jerseys of all of the different teams they supported. Russell was a Patriots fan. He wore a Patriots jersey in his casket on the day that would have been his 48th birthday.  Vicente Juarez was a stockroom attendant and a forklift operator. He had been at Henry Pratt for 13 years, since the year 2006. Mr. Juarez and his wife of 38 years lived in a home in Oswego with their three grown children and eight grandchildren--all under one roof.  I will not forget that scene at the funeral home, either, because the family had decided that everyone would wear a T-shirt. It was a black T-shirt with a color photograph of Vicente in front of it and one of his favorite sayings on the back of it. There they were--grandchildren, children, older folks--all wearing those black T-shirts in honor and memory of this man.  I met his sister. His sister told me a story that Vicente was part of the family who immigrated to Illinois in 1972. There were five boys and five girls. They didn't have any money. Their father died 6 years after they immigrated. Yet they struggled and worked and stuck together as a family. That beautiful family--that beautiful family--had to shoulder this tragedy, where this gunman walked into that warehouse and killed Vicente.  Josh Pinkard's photograph is here. He was the plant manager. He joined Henry Pratt's parent company 13 years ago at a facility in his native Alabama. He and his wife had moved to Illinois with their three little kids last spring. As he lay dying, Josh pulled out his cell phone and texted his wife. His message was this: ``I love you. I've been shot at work.'' He died shortly thereafter. Josh Pinkard was 37 years old.  How did the police respond to this mass shooting? Every on-duty member of the Aurora Police Department rushed to the scene, where they were joined quickly by off-duty members of the police department. Then, once the word got out that a policeman had been injured, hundreds of other policemen, firefighters, and other first responders all came to the scene.  I was on the phone with the Aurora police chief, Kristen Ziman. Kristen put out a statement, which I commended her for. It was the most eloquent statement. It said many things, but I want to repeat what it said. She said: ``Every time an officer was hit, another one went in. No one retreated.''  All told, five members of the Aurora Police Department were injured by gunfire: Officer Adam Miller, Officer Marco Gomez, Officer John Cebulski, Officer James Zegar, and Officer Reynaldo Rivera. A sixth officer, Diego Avila, suffered a knee injury. They and hundreds of other police officers and first responders who rushed to the scene are heroes. Simply put, they are heroes. Their quick and courageous response certainly saved other lives.  Here is the cruel irony and tragedy beyond the loss of life. The gunman should never have had a begun. In 1995, this gunman pleaded guilty in the State of Mississippi to charges that he had beaten a former girlfriend with a baseball bat and stabbed her with a knife. He was sentenced to 5 years in prison. He served 3.  In January of 2014--19 years later--he applied for an Illinois firearm owner's identification card. He lied on that application. He said he had no felony record, and he was given permission under Illinois law to buy a firearm. He got away with that lie because the State of Mississippi had failed to submit his conviction record to the FBI's criminal background check system. He wasn't in the computer as being disqualified.  In March 2014, this man bought a handgun from a gun dealer in Aurora. Two weeks later, he applied for a concealed carry permit. This time he slipped up. He voluntarily submitted his fingerprints in the hopes that his concealed carry permit would be expedited. Those fingerprints finally exposed his felony record in Mississippi and his violent past.  The Illinois State Police got word of it, rejected his concealed carry application, revoked his firearm owner's identification card, and sent him a letter saying that he needed to surrender the Smith & Wesson firearm, which he used to kill these five innocent people and to injure these policemen. Obviously, he never surrendered the weapon. It was that same weapon that he used to kill these innocent people and to injure these policemen.  Almost 7 years ago, a disturbed young man opened fire in a movie theater in a suburb of Denver, killing 12 people and injuring 70 others. The name of that suburb was Aurora--Aurora, CO.  In a sad commentary on how frequent mass shootings have become in this great Nation, the police chief of Aurora, CO, tweeted after the killings in Aurora, IL: ``Months from now, as people talk about the mass shooting in Aurora, someone will ask, ``Which Aurora mass shooting are you talking about?''  Mass shootings have become too common in America. They make the news, but tens of thousands of Americans die every year from gun violence, and many of those deaths are barely reported or noted. They die in suicides and gun accidents, alone or in small groups, in domestic disturbances, in gang disputes, and in crossfire.  I am honored to represent the city of Chicago, but my heart breaks to know that last year more than 2,700 people were injured or killed by gun violence in that great city.  Let's face it, America is confronting an epidemic of gun violence. We need thoughts and prayers, but we need so much more. We need action to do something.  Do the lives of these policemen mean anything? Of course, they do. They mean a great deal to their families, and they mean a great deal to this Nation.  Do the lives of these victims who died mean anything? I met the families--four of them. They are heartbroken, and their lives will never be the same.  We need action to close the deadly gaps in America's gun background check system. Much of the work needs to take place at the State level. State and local law enforcement agencies are investigating how this tragedy might have been prevented and how to prevent another violent felon from slipping through the cracks in the system.  We also have a responsibility here. It is not enough for a moment of silence. It is not enough for prayers to be offered. We need to do more to keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.  This week, the House of Representatives will vote on a measure to close the gun show and internet loopholes in our background check system. These loopholes make a mockery of the law, which says we want to make sure that no dangerous person buys a firearm or keeps a firearm in America. It is critically important, and I support the House's effort, but, sadly, I have to predict that this measure will not even come up for a debate--let alone a vote--in this Republican-controlled Senate. There is just no way that they will consider any gun safety measure.  After Columbine and nearly every mass shooting and natural disaster since, a carpenter who lives in Illinois has crafted wooden memorials to honor the fallen.  His name is Greg Zanis, 68 years old. In 20 years, he has made and delivered--listen to this--more than 26,274 handmade wooden crosses, Stars of David, and crescent moons to communities across this country.  Greg drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after 26 first graders and educators were murdered in their grade school. He drove to Las Vegas after 58 people were killed at a music festival. He drove to the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, TX, after 26 worshipers were killed. He drove to Pittsburgh, PA, to honor the 11 worshipers killed at the Tree of Life synagogue.  Even after all that tragedy, the mass murder at Henry Pratt hit Greg Zanis especially hard. You see, Greg Zanis's hometown is Aurora, IL. Mr. Zanis told a reporter from the New York Times that he could drive away from all of the other tragedies, but he said: ``I am not going to be able to get away from this one.''  To those who will say that the aftermath of a mass shooting is not the time to talk about gun safety, I have one simple question: When is the right time to talk about gun safety? If we are going to talk about it only on the days when no one dies in America because of the use of guns, then, of course, we will never talk about it.  Will you wait until this killing comes to your community, your church, your kid's school? Is that what it will take before Members of the Senate and the people across this Nation feel as Greg Zanis does, that you just can't escape this carnage anymore? I pray that is not the case.  We need to work together. Let's start. Let's do something sensible and bipartisan in the name of gun safety to make our background check systems as effective as they can be.  Look at those faces. Eleven days ago, they were alive, part of a family, loved--sons, fathers, grandfathers--and now they are gone because one man who never should have owned a gun took it to work in a fit of anger and killed these five men. It is time for this Senate and this Congress to do something.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, President Trump declared a national emergency 2 weeks ago. He did this in order to build a pet project of his. In the process, he said it was his intent to siphon billions of dollars that Congress had appropriated to help our men and women in uniform. Now, I am not sure what lawyers he consulted, but those lawyers seem to have overlooked our Nation's founding document--the U.S. Constitution.  I know the President likes to communicate in 280 characters or less, so I will point him to a 77-character phrase he may want to review: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''  That is a short sentence, but our Founders knew what it meant. They enshrined it in article I, section 9 of the Constitution, and they established that Congress--and Congress alone--possesses the power of the purse. That Congress has exclusive power over our government's spending priorities is one of the most critical checks and balances in our constitutional system. The President can propose funding for whatever project he wants. He has the absolute right to propose funding, but it is the job of Congress to decide where to invest the American people's hard-earned tax dollars.  Let's review the facts. For over 2 years, the President has repeatedly tried and has repeatedly failed to convince Congress that building his southern border wall is a good idea. He has failed to get a deal with Mexico despite giving his word and promising his supporters more than 200 times that Mexico would pay for it. He promised that Mexico would pay for it while knowing, of course, that Mexico would not pay a cent for it. Then he failed to get a deal with his own party even during the 2 years when the Republicans controlled the Presidency, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. He also failed to get a deal after he forced the country into a 35-day government shutdown over the issue--a shutdown, incidentally, that cost our country at least $11 billion, to say nothing of the number of people whose lives were so disrupted that many either lost their apartments, were unable to pay their mortgages, were unable to pay their bills, or were unable to pay for the medical care they needed.  Yet, in the face of all of these failings, he has decided to go it alone. He has decided to stretch his powers--beyond all recognition--under the National Emergencies Act. There is no rational basis to justify the use of this authority. So we should look at what a bipartisan group of Republicans and Democrats wrote--a group of 58 former senior national security officials who had to help secure our country under both Republican and Democratic Presidents.  They wrote: ``There is no factual basis for the declaration of a national emergency'' on the southwest border.  I ask unanimous consent that the Joint Declaration of Former United States Government Officials be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Mr. President, the reality, of course, is that apprehensions at the southwest border have dropped 75 percent since 2000. The reality is that many of the southern border communities have violent crime rates that are lower than our national average. The reality is that the vast majority of the drugs that are apprehended at the border are seized at the ports of entry, and a wall would do nothing to stop this. The President is either out of touch with reality, willfully ignoring it, or not even reading the material he gets from his administration.  Presidents do have emergency powers, but they should be invoked only in true times of crises. It is an abuse of power to invoke these authorities simply as a political step to energize a President's base. It is an abuse of power to invoke these authorities to fulfill a cynical campaign promise he never should have made. The President knew he would never keep his word or the promise he had made that Mexico would pay for this border wall.  When Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to convey these powers to the President, it assumed whoever sat in the Oval Office would have enough respect for the office and the power being conveyed not to abuse it. President Trump has failed that test. Since 1976, Presidents of the United States--Republicans and Democrats alike--have upheld and passed the test. President Trump has failed the test. Look what he wants to do. The President wants to raid money that is meant for military housing and military base improvements to pay for his wall. This is at a time when studies are coming out that show how our men and women in the military are being housed in inferior or dangerous conditions. Sometimes the buildings have mold and decay, and it affects their health. The buildings are rat invested and roach infested, but the President wants to take the money away from them to build a wall that we do not need. The President has repeatedly decried the amount of drugs coming across our border. But now he wants to raid money that Congress has appropriated for proven drug programs and counter-drug programs to pay for his wall. Let me repeat that. In order to build a wall that would do very little to stop drugs from coming across our border, President Trump wants to take money away from law enforcement programs that actually prevent drugs from coming across our border or from programs that enhance military readiness. I wish I were making this up. It sounds like something you hear on a comedy program, but it is not comedy, it is reality, and I have to ask, what is going on?  In the days and weeks ahead, the President's emergency declaration--which amounts to an end run around both the Constitution and Congress--is going to be challenged, and it should be. Over the past 2 years, we have seen the erosion of our institutional checks and balances in the face of creeping authoritarianism. The time has come for Congress and members of the President's own party to take a stand. Are we a democracy, or are we an authoritarian government? It is a pretty basic question.  I have been here with every President since President Gerald Ford. They upheld the Constitution, Republicans and Democrats, and they believed in the separation of power. All of them did. We simply cannot afford to now remain silent in the face of such an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers.  It is interesting. As I sit here, I remember some of my Republican friends--and they are my friends--when President Obama was President. They shouted from every rooftop about the lurches of an imperial Presidency. In every Executive order, they saw a threat to Congress's power. In every speech, they surmised the machinations of a lawless strong man--a man Donald Trump claimed wasn't born in the United States. Now, when they are faced with a President who is literally using his Executive powers to fund what Congress specifically would not, my Republican friends should echo the same concerns.  I am glad that some in the Republican Party have begun expressing their reservations about President Trump's national emergency declaration. Certainly a number of Republicans who serve in national security positions who signed on to the material I have put in the Record did. But fleeting comments to reporters in the hallway are meaningless unless they are willing to follow up their words with their votes.  Today, the House will vote to disapprove the President's declaration. I believe that joint resolution of disapproval will pass the House. In short order, the Senate will have to vote on it. That is going to be the true test. That will be the metric history uses to determine whether Republicans are willing to put our country, our Constitution, and Congress itself over party.  While the President's emergency declaration stumbles its way through the courts, I hope my Republican friends take a moment to take stock of where we are. President Trump will be just a blip in our Nation's history. But for the sake of appeasing a man who hundreds of times made a foolish campaign promise, never grounded in reality, will they forever change the course of the separation of powers in our country? For the sake of appeasing a President who detests any limits or checks on his authority, will they forever diminish the role of Congress as a coequal branch of government? We are the longest surviving democracy on Earth today because there are checks and balances.  I am reminded of words of caution written by George Washington, our Founding Father and our Nation's first President, in his Farewell Address. The words are as true today, and we read this Farewell Address every year on the floor of the Senate. Here is what President Washington wrote over 223 years ago: That is what George Washington said. He warned us against despots. Remember, this was a man who could have remained President for life, and he voluntarily stepped down after a second term. He was a man who did that because he wanted democracy to thrive.  He spoke of the three coequal branches of government--the executive, the legislative, and the judiciary--and he was reminding us that if you let one encroach upon the other, you start down the path of despotism. We don't need that in this country, especially in this age. We don't.  We know what despots are like. We see them around the world. We see them in South America today, in one country in particular. We see them in North Korea, where the despot had his uncle executed, his own brother murdered, and thousands of people are imprisoned, starved, and dying. A despot who continues to build nuclear weapons to keep himself in power even as his people die of starvation. In a democracy, that doesn't happen. We have checks and balances for a reason.  I am going to vote aye on this joint resolution of disapproval. I urge all Senators to do the same. Have checks and balances.  I remind the President to treat emergency declarations the same way they have been treated since 1976, the way--certainly in my experience--Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, both Bushes, Clinton, and Obama did. That preserved democracy. Was it frustrating to each of them at times? Of course it was. I remember long discussions with President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President George H. W. Bush, President George W. Bush, President Clinton, and President Obama. They would say: We want to do this. A number of us had to say: You don't have the authority to do that. And they realized that.  It is not the person who holds the office. It is not the Presiding Officer. It is not me. It is not the other 98 Members of this body. It is not the President of the United States. It is not the Members of the House. It is not the members of the courts. What rules this country is our Constitution. We are a democracy. We must keep it as a democracy. Look what happens in those countries where they ignore democracy and have despots. In Venezuela, people are going without food and medicine. In the Philippines, where there is a despot, there have been murders of people who are just under suspicion, encouraged by him. We have seen the deaths of thousands of people in North Korea because of a despot who does not care and has no sense of morality.  America is so much better. Follow our Constitution. Obey our Constitution. Realize there are checks and balances. Have both Republicans and Democrats stand up and join. Remember what George Washington said. It was good advice back then; it is good advice today.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I was necessarily absent from yesterday evening's vote on cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 311, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. On vote No. 27, had I been present, I would have been a yea vote on the motion to invoke cloture.  Let me say that a little differently. As I sat, waiting for my plane to leave Charleston, SC, to come to the Nation's Capital--a trip that typically takes about 63 minutes--3 hours later, I had not yet arrived in Washington, DC.  On a vote that, to me, should not be a vote at all--this should be common sense, but it certainly was not common sense, so we had to have a vote on an issue that is very near and dear to my heart.  I will say without any question that the frustration I felt at being late to that vote was one that was incredibly irritating and infuriating. I had planned to be on the floor of the Senate voting yes on a commonsense piece of legislation, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, but was unable to make it because a 1-hour flight took more than 3 hours, and I arrived here about 4 minutes after the close of the vote, which also is quite frustrating.  But what is even more frustrating than that is that in a nation of good conscience, we would be debating and having a conversation about a child who is born, sitting there, alive, separated from her mother, that there would be a question of whether that child should be able to continue to live.  This is an issue that has been raised by people coming out of New York and more recently by people coming out of Virginia and by the Governor--who happens to be, from my understanding, a pediatric surgeon--who suggested it is OK to allow that child to die.  Whether you are pro-life, as I am, or pro-choice, as others, I cannot imagine that this would even be an issue of debate or discussion between the two sides. There is no side on this topic. There cannot be a side about life separated from the mother and whether that life should continue to live. This is common sense. This is human decency. This is not an issue of being pro-life or pro-choice. This is being pro-child, which we all should be.  So I find myself at a loss for words, standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate--where a vote yesterday failed by several votes--having to discuss what doesn't make sense.  I have recently spoken to a group in Charleston, SC, during Black History Month, where the GOP and African Americans were in the same room having a great conversation about the issues that are important to our Nation. We talked about so many of the powerful issues of economic opportunity and opportunity zones. There may have been some disagreement on whether we should have higher taxes or lower taxes, but there was no disagreement on the issue of infanticide. There was no disagreement whatsoever. In the room, whether you were to the left or to the right, there was one thing that was common, and that was the value of life.  I traveled to Little Rock, AR, this weekend to speak at another Black History Month event, where Republicans and Democrats were coming together at the Governor's Mansion to have a conversation about moving this Nation forward and about reconciliation. In the room, we had conversations about the tragedies in Virginia, from the blackface tragedy to the issues with the three ranking members in the Commonwealth of Virginia. When I started talking about the value of human life, the intrinsic value of each human being, there was 100 percent support that we are a nation that should always value the life of a born-alive child. There was not a single dissent in a room of nearly 400 people.  To have to have a debate on the floor of the Senate about something that every American with whom I have spoken, in airports or at events, agrees there is nothing to debate, frustrates me. So while I am saddened and frustrated, I have been encouraged by my fellow Americans--from Arkansas to South Carolina, to Tennessee--who have all come to the same conclusion, and that is that a born-alive child deserves to live.  We may disagree on other points, but this is a place where there is universal agreement with the folks I have spoken to. These are folks who don't vote for Republicans or Democrats; they all vote for children. They all vote for life.  We are a nation that must continue to value life. For some reason, somehow, this body missed that opportunity to reinforce that value system before the American public, to say to each child born: No matter your State, no matter your challenges, you have intrinsic value.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise in opposition to a nomination we are going to be vote on very soon--the confirmation of Eric Miller to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  As a U.S. Senator, I take my obligation to advise and consent on judicial nominations very seriously, and I believe Mr. Miller's confirmation process has gone against longstanding Senate tradition and norms and limited our role to advise and consent on his nomination.  This nomination has proceeded over the objection of both myself and my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray. For more than 100 years, conferring with Senators and allowing them to advise and consent on judicial nominees in their home State has been our process.  Since 1936, only eight judges have been confirmed when one home State Senator objected. In every case, confirmed nominees have been supported by at least one Senator from the nominee's State, and to this day no circuit court judge has ever been confirmed despite opposition from their home State Senators. All that would change if Mr. Miller is confirmed.  His confirmation hearing was held during a recess last Congress, when the vast majority of Senators were back in their States. In fact, only two Members of the U.S. Senate were present at the hearing, and neither one of them were Democrats. Mr. Miller was questioned for less than 5 minutes--5 minutes--and when the Judiciary Committee Democrats requested another hearing, that request was rejected.  Confirming Mr. Miller without a full vetting by both Democrats and Republicans is the wrong way to proceed on a lifetime appointment. Moreover, confirming Mr. Miller without approval from Senator Murray and I would set a damaging precedent.  I do have concerns about Eric Miller's record. He has spent much of his career fighting against the interests of Tribal governments and Tribal sovereignty. He has argued cases opposing Tribal fishing rights, challenging Tribal sovereignty, and fighting against the protection of Native American religious and traditional practices, so it is no surprise that organizations representing all 573 Tribal nations around the United States, including the National Congress of American Indians, oppose Mr. Miller's confirmation.  I urge my colleagues to stop this process and oppose Mr. Miller's confirmation to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Mr. President, I also want to comment on upcoming action in the House, where they are scheduled to take up S. 47, the Murkowski-Cantwell lands package later this afternoon, which received 92 votes in the Senate earlier this month.  It is my hope that the House will approve this bill with the same overwhelming that it received in the Senate, and send this legislation quickly to President Trump's desk.  I want to take a moment to emphasize four important provisions of this legislation as we prepare for this year's upcoming fire season.  This legislation includes four provisions that will help firefighters improve their safety and effectiveness and bring state-of-the-art technology to combating wildfires. These provisions will help firefighters and communities, and we need to do everything we can as we face longer fire seasons having more catastrophic events. We need to give communities and firefighters every tool possible.  First, this legislation allows for the use of drones to create real-time fire mapping, as well as GPS to track firefighter crews. These advances will help enable real-time tracking and location of both the fire and the firefighters.  Why is this so important? It is because our firefighters need real-time data to do their job more safely and effectively. The combination of real-time mapping and GPS locaters has been referred to by the industry as the ``Holy Grail of Wildland Firefighter Safety.''  Last month's report on the devastating Mendocino Complex fire shows why this is the case. According to this report, one of the challenges frontline firefighters had to face was the fact that they weren't sure exactly where the fire was. The safety officers didn't always know where the firefighters are. In one case, no one knew where six entrapped firefighters were. The result was that all six suffered injuries because it took quite a while to locate and rescue them.  Under this legislation that will be voted on by the House today, we will have more drones orbiting high over the fires, constantly updating fire maps and doing it more than just once a day, which has been the standard until now. These drones employ infrared cameras that can penetrate through thick smoke and better identify hotspots. Air tankers will be able to more accurately drop their fuel retardants, and we can tell firefighters on the frontlines how to steer away from areas that are just too dangerous to tackle.  When I heard the stories of brave firefighters who battled fire that raged in many parts of my State, I knew we needed to do more to protect these unbelievable heroes. Whether it is in Eastern Washington or Central Washington--in the Okanagon and Wenatchee forests or around Spokane--we have to do more to help those communities and firefighters who are putting themselves on the line for us.  This legislation also allows the Forest Service to access NASA's mapping technology to help prevent mudslides that are all too common after these horrific fires. We all know erosion can happen shortly after the devastation of vegetation, and that creates more damage in the community. The fact that we will be getting NASA access, we will then be able to come up with strategies to prevent erosion, cutting the time significantly from where it is today.  The fourth provision is improving smoke forecasting by assigning meteorologists to every large fire. I know some people are thinking this probably has already been done. Believe me, we haven't given the Forest Service every tool it needs.  Over the last few years, summers in the Puget Sound region have suffered as fires have blanketed our normally pristine air with smoke and unhealthy air. We know this is becoming a new normal. As the Western United States continues to become hotter and drier, fires become more and more likely, and as the fuels get drier, the number of fires increase and get even bigger.  This isn't just an Eastern Washington problem. Our Washington State Department of Natural Resources responded to 1,800 fires last year, and 40 percent of those were in Western Washington. According to researchers at the University of Washington, just 20 years from now, we will see the median annual burned area in the Northwest double from what we have seen in the last 50 years.  We know we need more tools to combat these challenges, and the legislation we have already passed in the Senate and that is before the House today will provide these new technology and training tools to empower the Forest Service to help our communities and our firefighters: real-time fire mapping, more drone technology to give us real-time information about the fires, using NASA data to help us plan post-fires, and giving us more smoke forecasting information to better help our communities and to deal with those who are impacted by heavy smoke.  I hope our colleagues will act expeditiously on this legislation. We know that wildland fire funding, as we increased it in an agreement last year, was so important, but we need to keep working on this problem.  I thank my colleague from Colorado for helping to sponsor the inclusion of this legislation and hope that the President will sign this legislation very quickly so that tools can be put in place for this upcoming fire season.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, yesterday evening the Senate had an opportunity to go on record and show our constituents that we supported the most vulnerable among us. The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would require doctors to treat a baby, once it is born, with ordinary medical assistance, something they would do under any other circumstances, even though this entailed surviving an abortion.  If you ask the American people, they would say this is just common sense. In a recent poll, more than three-fourths of Americans said they support providing medical treatment for babies who survive abortions. I can't imagine what the other 25 percent are thinking. But there are no Federal laws requiring healthcare providers to care for these babies just as they would any other infant in their care, and for some Members of the opposing party, they are just fine with that.  We all know that a few weeks ago, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam made disturbing comments about how to not care for certain newborns. He was asked: What would you do with a child with birth defects?  He said: Well, the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated, if that is what the mother and the family desired, and then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother.  Let me be clear. The Governor, who is a pediatrician, by the way, essentially advocated for infanticide--killing a child who was born alive. Instead of saying, ``well, it is my duty as a physician under the Hippocratic Oath to provide care to save the child,'' he believes the child ought to be made comfortable, and then the mother and doctor sit down and decide whether the child should live or die.  That is not healthcare. That is murder. I believe the Senate has a duty to act and ensure that no child born alive is subjected to the treatment described by Governor Northam.  The bill we voted on last night would protect newborns who have survived abortions and ensure that they receive the same level of care that any other newborn baby would. It builds upon a previous law, which the Senate passed unanimously, called the Born-Alive Infant Protection Act. That bill passed unanimously in 2002, and it clarified that every infant born alive at any stage of development is a person, regardless of the manner in which they were born. Yet yesterday, 44 Senators voted to allow that same person's life to be ended with impunity.  The legislation we voted on yesterday would simply clarify that the infants who survive abortions are entitled to the same lifesaving care that other babies should receive. That is why it is so shocking to me that 44 of our colleagues chose to vote against even proceeding to a debate and a vote on the matter.  I am trying to think of a historical counterpart to this. I was reminded of a book I read not long ago called ``Eichmann in Jerusalem.'' This is about the trial of Adolf Eichmann after the atrocities of the holocaust, during which 5 million Jews were killed. The author, Hannah Arendt, was trying to figure out what kind of monster could basically provide for the machinery that ultimately would take the lives of 5 million Jews.  What she saw when she looked at Eichmann was not some monster that looked different from you or me. Unfortunately, what she saw was somebody who looked exactly like you and me. She wrote about the moral collapse associated with the holocaust. She noted that ``in the Third Reich, evil lost its distinctive characteristic by which most people had, until then, recognized it.'' She said that the problem is that at that point it became a ``civil norm.''  She wrote:  Evil comes from a failure to think. It defies thought, for      as soon as thought tries to engage itself with evil and      examine the premises and principles from which it originates,      it is frustrated because it finds nothing there.  ``That,'' she said, ``is the banality of evil.''  She concluded by saying:       Nearly everybody who attended the trials of mass killers      after the war, some of them respected doctors and      pharmacists, came away with the disconcerting impression that      the killers looked pretty much like you and me.  So while Republicans and Democrats disagree on a range of issues, this should not be one of them. If we have one shred of our humanity left, we ought to agree that protecting human life is essential. This should have been a simple vote for every single Member of this body. I can't tell you how disappointed I am that 44 of our colleagues decided to vote no. I was proud to vote yes on the bill, yes to protecting these newborn babies, yes to equal medical care for all infants, and yes to life."

                "speech":"Madam President, this morning, the Senate Finance Committee held the second in a series of hearings on prescription drug pricing. We all know that across the country, the rising costs of prescription drugs is placing a strain on families.  A survey last summer found that many Texans are struggling to afford the rising cost of healthcare, and three out of five people surveyed reported foregoing or postponing care because of the cost. That includes cutting pills in half, skipping or rationing doses, or not filling a prescription because they simply can't afford to do so. Some, though, are taking even more drastic steps.  Last year, a widow in Austin considered selling her house to pay for the expensive drugs she needed to treat hepatitis C, which had killed her husband years earlier. Many Texas families have begun the dangerous practice of buying their drugs in Mexico--even though they may be counterfeit--because they think they are more affordable than filling a prescription in the United States.  With healthcare costs continuing to press more and more of our hard-working families, things aren't expected to get any easier any time soon. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that between 2018 and 2027, consumers could expect to see prescription drug spending increase by an average of 6.1 percent a year. That is a faster increase than hospital stays, doctors' visits, or any other cost in the healthcare sector.  This spending doesn't just have an impact on patients. It accounts for a large portion of our national economy. In 2017, the national health expenditures totaled $3.5 trillion. That is 18 percent of our gross domestic product. Prescription drugs account for 10 percent of our total health expenditures, more than $330 billion. They have an impact on our entire country.  The Senate Finance Committee is digging into the reason behind those rising costs. The journey a drug takes from research and development to the manufacturing plant, to pharmacy shelves, and to our medicine cabinet is enormously complicated. I wonder whether it is complicated by design. Once a consumer has purchased a drug, figuring out who gets each dollar spent practically requires the forensic skills of a Sherlock Holmes.  What I find particularly concerning, and something we spoke about at length today, are the rebates and other discounts provided by manufacturers. Pricing from one pharmacy to another can be wildly inconsistent, and rebates are often the root of the problem. In another context, what is now called a rebate might be called a kickback. Rebates are the key to determining if a particular drug is covered by your insurance, and that can impact therapies that you have access to. Despite the impact they have, the terms of rebates are mostly cloaked in secrecy. I don't think that is an accident. If you ask pharmacy benefit managers and plans about rebates, they will argue that overall they are a good thing and can help lower insurance premiums across the board. The issue, though, is that the extra money has to come from somewhere. So list prices are often raised to cover the difference. When that happens, the consumers are the ones who take the hit. For everything you pay within your deductible--and many deductibles in this post-Affordable Care Act era are up in the thousands of dollars--you pay 100 percent of the retail cost. You get zero benefit from the rebate. As the list price goes up, your out-of-pocket costs go up. That is why the stories of families struggling to cover costs are becoming more and more prevalent.  Some of the people who suffer the most from the rebate system are people who take insulin. Diabetes is one of the most common and pernicious illnesses in our healthcare system in America today. Because we eat too well and exercise too little, many people develop diabetes, and the only treatment is to take insulin. Unlike most of the prescription drugs out there, insulin is a biologic, meaning it is generally more expensive to make and more expensive to buy.  A few weeks ago, I spoke here on the Senate floor about a woman from Indiana who came to the first hearing we had on prescription drug costs, Kathy Sego. She told us about her family's struggle to pay for her adult son's insulin. Even though this drug has been around for nearly a century, a 1-month supply for Kathy's son Hunter costs her family $1,700 out of pocket.  Unlike many brand-name prescription drugs that have lower-cost alternatives, like a generic, insulin does not. Part of our discussion at today's hearing was the topic of ``biosimilars,'' or what could be considered a generic version of a biologic type of drug. As the FDA is moving to make insulin subject to biologic competition in the future, I asked our witnesses about this move and how it could potentially serve as a solution for families like Kathy's, who struggle with the out-of-pocket costs and copays as a result of the insulin with which they treat their diabetes.  As part of that effort, last week, Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden launched a bipartisan investigation into insulin prices. In letters to leading insulin manufacturers, they requested information on the recent price increases--some as high as 585 percent.  As I expressed today to one of the representatives from the drug company, I understand the need for drug companies to do research and development and that because they are granted patents for these innovative cures that they come up with, they have the exclusive right to sell those drugs during the terms of the patents. Yet I don't understand why a drug that has been around for decades, like insulin, still costs $1,700 for somebody to pay each month on an out-of-pocket basis, and where we have seen recent price increases as high as 585 percent, it makes absolutely zero sense to me. I am eager to hear from these manufacturers and other players in the pharmaceutical system about why these prices are rising so rapidly and how we, in working together, can provide relief to families who bear the brunt of manufacturers' decisions.  I conclude by saying that I also had an interesting conversation with one of the witnesses from the drug companies, the manufacturer of HUMIRA. HUMIRA is one of the best-selling drugs in the world for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other things. The company that makes HUMIRA earns $18 billion a year in revenue from the sale of HUMIRA. When I asked why it was necessary for the company to have more than 100 different patents to cover that drug when the drug is essentially the same molecule, the gentleman representing the drug company did not give me a satisfactory answer.  I can understand the importance of recouping those R&D costs and the benefits of providing a patent for a reasonable period of time to recoup those costs and make a profit. I am OK with that. Yet, when you see the patent system being manipulated in a way that maintains that exclusive right to sell that best-selling drug by a drug company, that causes me grave concern. I have talked to Chairman Graham of the Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over patent-related issues, and he told me he would work with me to find a solution to gaming the patent system in order to protect that exclusive right to sell a drug beyond the normal patent period because it is, ultimately, the consumers who are being cheated and being denied access to the lower cost drugs.  As with insulin, there is no good reason why, after all of these years, consumers have to see price increases approaching 585 percent. We need answers to those questions, and we will get answers to those questions.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise in opposition to the pending nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in a seat based out of the State of Washington.  If the Senate chooses to confirm Mr. Miller, it will be a historic decision because it will be the first time ever since the introduction of blue slips over 100 years ago that the Senate has confirmed a nominee who is not supported by either of the home State Senators from the State in which he will be seated.  What is a blue slip? It is basically a consultation with the Senate before we move forward on a nomination. It is a courtesy that has been extended. It is an effort to try to find some common ground, some understanding, perhaps some moderation when it comes to the choice of nominees. It has been abused in some cases, but the two Senators here--Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray--are well known in this body for being reasonable people who try to find solutions to problems and work well with both sides of the aisle. Yet, in this case, the Trump White House has decided that they are going to push this nominee for the Ninth Circuit in their home State of Washington against their wishes. If Mr. Miller is confirmed, we will have taken away yet another guardrail in the Senate advice and consent process.  If you follow what has happened in the Senate over the last 2 years and a few months, you know that the highest single priority of Senator McConnell's--the Republican leader--is to fill the Federal judgeships, to put in place men and women who will serve literally for a lifetime, as long as they live. He is determined to do it. There is a template for the people who they find acceptable. If you have been a law clerk for Clarence Thomas, you check the box, you are ready to go--a lifetime appointment. If the Federalist Society decides you are the right person for the Supreme Court of the United States, box checked, off we go.  Instead of relying on common sense, moderation, and judgment, we are going through a formula here to put people on the bench for a lifetime--those who have been approved on the Republican side of the aisle. Make no mistake--under Democratic Presidents, we look to nominees who are closer to our value system, for sure, but we never walked away from the blue slip process until this nominee--the first time ever it has been done.  We have seen so many things change under the Republican leadership in the Senate when it comes to the selection of judges.  We used to say that if you are found unqualified--not qualified--by the American Bar Association, forget it. Go about your business. Do something else. We are not going to put you on the bench for life. Well, we have decided, under the Republican leadership, that is no longer the case. Simply being unqualified is not enough to disqualify you.  We have also said that when it comes to the process of making these decisions, we will have hearings where we will consider multiple candidates in the same day. Let's run them through. Of course, you know what happens when you do that: You get in a hurry, and you end up putting people on the bench for life who shouldn't be there.  We have also decided in this White House that we will send people off to be Federal judges who have never been in a courtroom in their lives--not once. Maybe they watched ``Perry Mason'' on some retro channel, but that is about as good as it ever was for some of them.  I recall one of the nominees from the Trump White House. It was a moment in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana asked him some basic questions about what it meant to be a judge and some of the things he would have to rule on. It was a sad moment. It reminded me of my worst days in law school when I didn't know the answers to the test or to the question being asked by the professor. This nominee, thankfully, withdrew. He never should have been nominated.  In this case, when it comes to Mr. Miller, neither of the Washington Senators returned a blue slip on him, and they have a reason. He is 43 years old; he may serve on the bench for three decades or more. In his relatively short legal career, he has demonstrated that his views are far outside the legal mainstream, particularly when it comes to one legal issue--the issue involving Indian Tribes.  I don't know if you watched the Oscars, but I did, and I was watching for a movie that I saw that I was impressed with. It was called ``Roma.'' It was a movie about Mexico. It received quite a few awards, and I thought it deserved them. It raised some painful questions for people living in Mexico. I know because I have spoken to Mexican Parliamentarians at a dinner a few weeks ago. It is the treatment of indigenous people.  Most countries in the world, including the United States, haven't written a very admirable record when it comes to the treatment of people who were here before we ``arrived.'' What we have done to Native Americans in this country, sadly, is nothing to brag about. They were dispossessed, relocated for their lands, and many times treated in the poorest possible fashion. The movie ``Roma'' was about indigenous people of Mexico who are servants, and some would say slaves, to families who have more money in Mexico. So the question of the treatment of Native Americans is not something that we can just push back in the pages of history; it still confronts us in the United States today, as it does in other countries, like Mexico and Australia and so many others.  So what does this have to do with this nominee? It turns out that in a rare moment, the National Congress of American Indians weighed in against Eric Miller for this circuit court nomination. The National Congress of American Indians opposed his nomination. Here is what they wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, and I want to quote it in its substance: You might say to yourself: Well, that has to be a narrow area of the law--Tribal rights--and if he happens to consistently get that wrong, how important could it be?  Take a look at the fact that he has aspired to be a nominee to the circuit court--the second highest court in the land--in the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally recognized Tribal nations of America. That circuit he aspires to for a lifetime appointment hears more cases involving Tribal issues than any other Federal circuit. It is deeply troubling to see a Ninth Circuit nominee whose impartiality on Tribal legal matters is in question.  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by not only the National Congress of American Indians; he is also opposed by a broad array of civil rights, environmental, labor, and other organizations that are concerned about his record and legal views. He is 43 years old--43 years old--three more decades to hand down decisions.  It is astonishing that the Senate would vote to confirm a nominee this controversial over the objection of home State Senators and to break a century-old tradition in the Senate to do it. These Senators represent millions of people in the State of Washington. Their good judgment has been recognized by election and reelection. But when it comes to having a voice in the selection of a circuit court nominee who will be serving their State for the next three decades, they have been shunned and pushed aside.  I think the Republican majority is making a mistake. They are so bound and determined to fill these vacancies that they are abandoning basic Senate traditions--which, in fact, will slow things down from time to time, I am ready to admit, but also put at least a note of caution into a critical judgment process.  Blue slips encourage consensus and cooperation between the Senate and the White House. There isn't a single one of us serving in the Senate who hasn't counted on that cooperation to make sure that lifetime appointments to the Federal judiciary are people who can stand the test of time. Although they may not agree with any Senator every single time, they bring judgment, experience, balance, and moderation to their service. Blue slips ensure that the voices of the American people, through their Senators, are heard in this process, and they help steer the nomination process toward the middle of the road. Without blue slips, the White House can ignore home State interests and pick extreme judges who do not have the confidence of that State's legal community.  This decision--for the first time in a century--to abandon blue slips for the sake of putting this man in a lifetime position on the circuit bench could affect every one of our States someday. I can't understand why my Republican colleagues want to diminish their authority, their ability to safeguard against judges who should not be appointed for life. That is what we are doing on the vote to confirm Eric Miller to the Ninth Circuit.  I will oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same, if for no other reason, so that when the time comes--if it ever comes--that you ask for the respect of this body when it comes to the selection of an important Federal judge, you will receive it regardless of who the President may be.  Madam President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, there have been some days recently when I kind of wonder why we even show up to the Senate any longer. This job is not what it used to be.  When I get the chance to read about the history of the Senate, I read about these things called debates that we used to have on the floor of the Senate. I read about something called an amendment, which apparently is a way that an individual Senator calls up a proposal or an initiative and puts it on the floor for an up-or-down vote.  Those things don't really happen anymore in the U.S. Senate. We don't have open-ended debates on the big policies of the day.  I get it. When Republicans control the Senate, they control the agenda. When Democrats control the Senate, they control the agenda. At the very least, I would have hoped that the Senate majority, now in Republican hands, would put their policy initiatives before the Senate so we could have an open debate. That doesn't happen any longer. All we seem to be doing these days is voting on judges.  Now, that is a really important function of the U.S. Senate, and I am glad we are doing it, but today we are going to do something truly exceptional, which causes me, once again, to wonder what my job here is and to feel a little bit of sadness as to how it has changed and how much less substantive the input of each individual Senator is in the direction of this country.  Today, for the first time in the history of blue slips, we are going to vote and, I assume, confirm a judge who didn't get one blue slip from either of the home State Senators from which that judge comes from and is going to serve.  This has never happened before. Yet today we will vote on Eric Miller's nomination to be a judge on the Ninth Circuit from Washington. He is 43 years old, so he is going to be there for an awfully long time.  Eric Miller did not get a blue slip from either of Washington's Senators. Let me say that again. That has never happened before in the Senate. In fact, the last time a judge was confirmed without both blue slips was in 1989. That was the last time before this Congress that any judge was confirmed without both blue slips.  In that instance, it was a Democratic chairman of the Judiciary Committee who was confirming a judge over the objection of another Democrat. This is very different. These are two Democratic Senators from Washington, neither of them returning a blue slip on Eric Miller. Yet the majority has decided to go ahead and proceed with this confirmation.  This is a serious break with precedent. The last time Democrats controlled the U.S. Senate, Chairman Leahy was the head of the Judiciary Committee, and he did not hold a single hearing on an Obama nominee who did not have two blue slips--didn't hold a single hearing even when there were exceptional circumstances. There was one time when Senators initially returned the blue slips but later rescinded them. Those are two Republican Senators who submitted them, rescinded them--did not go forward with the nominee.  There was another circumstance in which Senators had recommended a nominee for the district court but then refused to submit blue slips when that judge was elevated to the appellate court. Once again, Senator Leahy honored that precedent.  Now Republicans have already taken advantage of Senator Leahy's decision to uphold precedent. I will just give you a couple of examples.  In the Seventh Circuit, Michael Brennan was confirmed for a seat that had been held open by Republicans since 2010. So, had Chairman Leahy decided to move forward without blue slips, that Seventh Circuit seat could have been filled, but because he upheld tradition, it was left open, filled by Republicans.  Similarly, for a district seat in South Carolina, Marvin Quattlebaum was confirmed to a seat that had been held open by Republicans, again, since 2013.  So Republicans have already taken advantage of the fact that Democrats upheld the blue-slip precedent, but now they are taking it a step further.  In the past, when Republicans have changed the rules here, as they did on the number of votes required to elevate a judge to the Supreme Court, they claimed it was because Democrats started it. I don't agree with that rationale. If you found the change for district court nominee so objectionable, I am not sure why you would decide to go further, but there is no excuse of that kind here. This is just a brash power grab because there is no claim that Democrats, when they were in the majority, violated the blue-slip principle. This is a fresh violation of tradition here in the Senate.  There is a reason we give deference to home State Senators. In these States and in these districts, there are particular issues that are important to their constituents that may be unique to their area in which they have more knowledge than the rest of us do. Some of the reasons Senators Murray and Cantwell are so concerned about this nominee are his extremist views on the issue of Tribal sovereignty, which is a very big deal in the State of Washington, and the idea that they are going to have somebody sitting in the Ninth Circuit who has these extreme views on limiting the rights of Tribes is of great concern to their constituents. That is why, traditionally, we have allowed for individual Senators to have that kind of voice and that kind of say. No longer.  I would just hope that my Republican friends understand how this works. Once the rule is gone, once the tradition is gone--listen, I am a relatively junior Senator here, so I don't want to speak for those who are going to be the chairman and ranking members of committees in the future, but I would imagine it is not coming back. I would imagine--once we get through today and Republicans have decided that individual Senators, unless they happen to be a member of the majority party, no longer have any say in who is appointed to their circuit courts--that horse has fully run out of the barn and across the field.  I don't know if that is a good thing for this body because it is just another hit. It is just another assault on the traditions of this place in which we used to try to work things out together, in which we used to honor the role that individual Senators have some say over what happens in their own States and their own regions.  I do sometimes wonder why we all keep on showing up here if we don't really debate legislation as we used to, if we don't get to offer amendments anymore, and if we don't have any say any longer in the judges who are appointed in our States and our districts, and this is just another day that makes me question that as well.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today to offer brief remarks on the nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  I have concerns about Mr. Miller's controversial record--some of his ideas and his jurisprudence--which I have spoken to on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which informed my vote against him on the committee.  But today, I want to speak about my reservations about this body's moving forward with his confirmation, given that neither of his home State Senators have returned a blue slip.  Let me briefly talk about what a blue slip is and why it matters. It is not in the Constitution. It was not something imagined by the Founders. It was something developed by the Members of this body to put one further bumper on the power of the President to nominate Federal judges and then for the Senate to carry out its constitutional advice and consent role. For a long time, it worked fine, and I actually had a terrific experience with the blue-slip process. Don McGahn, as the White House Counsel, and my senior Senator, Tom Carper, and I, when we had a vacancy--two vacancies, actually, in the Federal district court in Delaware--went to our local bar and asked for them to put together a committee to interview potential candidates.  We went to the White House Counsel and spoke about the importance of the Delaware district court and the process we were following, and, in the end, out of a very wide pool of initial candidates and the folks who were interviewed by a broad and nonpartisan selection committee of our local bar, we advanced three names to the White House. The White House picked two, and they were ultimately nominated, and Senator Carper and I both returned the blue slips on them. They proceeded. They were both confirmed. They are now seated as district court judges.  That is the way this ought to work. Why does it matter? It matters because our States are different. We are the United States, and each of our States has slightly different cultures, traditions, and communities. The point of having a Senate made up of 100 representatives of our 50 States is for each of us to come here and carry forward some of the values and traditions of our States.  I am a member of the Delaware bar. It is a bar with a great and proud tradition. It is a bar with a somewhat different culture--a much more collegial culture, I would argue, than many States around us, and it was important to me to be able to advocate to the President, to the White House, for the nomination of folks who would represent the best of our bench and bar.  Look, the President and I are in different parties. I understand that we will have different policy positions, but in order to get the absolute best and brightest of the American bar and to have them reflect the values and priorities of the State Senators are elected from, the blue slip was developed.  We have had a difficult and divisive and partisan period here in the Senate for as long as I have been here. I don't think it is because I am here, but it has been as long as I have been here--since 2010. We have had a number of regrettable changes in the policies and the practices and the culture of this place, but proceeding with a confirmation vote of a nominee who was not supported by either home State Senator for a circuit court position is unprecedented.  I think, before we proceed, this body should stop and reflect on what this means for our future. In a district as small as Delaware, it is likely the Senators actually know the nominees. In a circuit as large as the Ninth, which is the largest, geographically, in our whole country, it is almost a certainty that the Senators will not know the judges nominated by the President to represent their circuit.  The blue slip has long been a procedural barrier to the President's nominating people who did not reflect the bench and bar of the States from which they are drawn. The leader is pushing this forward, even over several other nominees pending on this floor.  One other piece of the process that brought us to today to a vote on Eric Miller's nomination for the Ninth Circuit that is worth commenting on is that the confirmation hearing on the Judiciary Committee was held while we were not in session. No Democrat was present to question this nominee. The questions that were raised and the comments that were made were only in writing and for the Record, and my understanding is, this questioning is very brief--just 5 minutes before just a handful of Republican Senators, I think two.  This young man is going to be given a lifetime appointment to one of the most important judicial posts in our country. Frankly, my own kids have to work longer and harder and answer more questions to get a good grade in high school than this gentleman did in terms of the confirmation process of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I am very worried about the precedent this sets, about what it says--which is that we continue to push past norms and traditions in this body--and about where we are headed.  It is my hope that some of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee will work with me in the months ahead to recognize that there is a long, now-bitter path of he said, she said, who shot John, who acted first, which has resulted in changes to the whole nomination process.  I think we can yet pull back to a place where those who are nominated are the best and brightest of our country, where, in the process, there are protections for the minority and the majority, and where we can all end up voting proudly for those who are nominated to serve on the Federal bench of the United States.  I increasingly hear commentators on cable talking about judges as if you can know how they will vote based on the President who nominated them. So-and-so is described as a Bush judge or a Reagan judge or a Clinton judge or an Obama judge, a Trump judge or a Bush judge, as if that tells you everything you need to know about a judge. It should not.  In my State, it doesn't, and it is my hope that we can yet pull ourselves back from the brink of one more step to a place where our judges are seen not as the black-robed individuals dispensing independent justice but as folks wearing blue and red jerseys advancing a partisan political agenda. That way lies disaster for our constitutional Republic.  Both parties have taken steps that have led us here. Both parties need to take steps that will heal this, and I intend to vote against the nomination of Mr. Miller because of my concerns about these procedural changes that I think are so destructive.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Well, ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I took a position that I think some people consider to be unpopular--particularly some of my friends back in my State--that I thought I would come back and explain. It has to do with the President's Executive action. It also has to do with communicating an important and somber subject.  There is a crisis at the border. I have been there. I didn't read about it. I didn't watch it on TV. I didn't read a tweet about it. I invested time down there, hours and hours with border security. I was on shallow draft boats. I was on horseback. I have been on ATVs. I spent a lot of time down at the border, and the one thing I will tell you is that the President is absolutely right. There is a crisis on the border--and not only on the southern border, but I will state that ranchers on the northern border also believe they have challenges that this President is right to address.  I also happen to agree with a good portion of how the President is going to do it after Congress failed to do its job. Keep in mind that over the last year, we have had on this floor Democrats and Republicans voting for as much as $25 billion for border security--Democrats and Republicans--and now we are fighting over a fraction of that.  The President needs to act. He got an appropriation of about $1.5 billion through the negotiated settlement a couple of weeks ago, and now he is taking the only action he can until Congress acts, and that is to figure out other sources of funding that he believes he can use within current statutory limits. The way he has done that is he has first taken the $1.3 billion that Congress did appropriate. He has another $2.5 billion and another $600 million that I believe he is right to reprogram, send to the southern border, and probably make some investment in the northern border.  Here is where I have a respectful difference of opinion with the President and the administration: It is the emergency order, that under the emergency powers act, he is using his authority to appropriate the remaining funds.  First off, those funds will come what we call the MILCON budget. That is military construction. Right now, we are trying to find out what that means--which projects we think are critical to help the readiness of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines; which investments that we were going to make, that we have already determined we should make in military construction, are going to be put on hold while we reprogram those dollars to go to the southern border.  The real problem I have is that this is only a fraction of what we all know we need to secure the border.  I want to go back to the humanitarian crisis, though. My wife and I had an interesting discussion the other night. She wasn't too happy when I took this position originally. I am still not sure if she is happy.  But to understand why I respectfully disagree with the President, you have to understand, again, as I started this discussion, that there is a crisis. There are people dying. There are millions of doses of poison coming across the border every single year that are killing tens of thousands of people. That is a crisis. There are thousands of people crossing the border and dying. They have what they call coyotes, human traffickers who will get them across the border, get people who will pay thousands of dollars to cross the border, and then they will say: Civilization is just an hour away.  It is an hour plane ride away. Most people don't understand the sheer size and scale of Texas, particularly those crossing the border in the dead of night, working with basically organized crime. You have to pay a toll to get through the so-called plazas that run the northern border of Mexico.  My problem right now has to do with an Executive order, the emergency declaration that the President intends to send to Congress.  My wife and I were having a discussion. She said: You just said you agree with the President that there is a crisis on the border; you agree with the President that we need to send resources down to the southern border and work on the northern border; you agree that Congress has failed to act; and you agree that if you were President, you would do exactly what he is doing.  I said yes.  She said: Why don't you support it?  I said: Because I am not the President. I am a Member of the U.S. Senate. I am a Member of a coequal branch who actually believes that this action falls within our purview. Now we are going to find out because I am sure we are going to be challenged in the courts. But I also worry not so much about this one--frankly, even the way this money is going to be programmed, I agree with. What I worry about are future Presidents and what they may do if we set this precedent going into the future.  We actually have a Democratic candidate running for President--this is one hypothetical. There have been some far-flung ones that I am not sure I completely agree with, but let me give this one. It relates to border security. We have someone who is a Member of this body who has publicly said that their priority, if they were elected to be President, would be to tear down borders, tear down walls, build bridges, and open the borders. Well, if you argue that there is a humanitarian crisis--and I have said there is already is one--what would prevent that President from issuing an Executive order that would divert military construction funding to tear down the walls that are going to be built now? If we give this President--a President I support and a President whose policies and priorities I agree with--that authority, that could be aiding and abetting a future President and empowering them beyond what I believe their authorities are, vested in the Constitution in article II.  So I have come here today in part to maybe take another stab at explaining to my wife why I have taken this position but also to explain to the American people and folks in North Carolina and across this country. I agree with the President. I know we have a crisis we have to take care of. We have a national security crisis, a homeland security crisis, and a humanitarian crisis. It is not the end; it is a portion of the means.  I applaud the President for taking the action up here and getting things going. I hope that over time, we can find a way to fully fund the border strategy on a bipartisan basis and also address other immigration issues that I believe are pressing for this Nation.  Madam President, thank you for allowing me to come to the floor and explain my position.  If anybody in North Carolina has any questions, I know they know how to get ahold of me because my phones are blowing up right now. But I do want to explain it to them in a way that makes sense. I am a steward of the U.S. Senate. I am a steward of the article I branch. That matters to me.  Thank you, Madam President."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today to join many of my colleagues who have come to the floor and to express my opposition to the nomination of Eric Miller to be U.S. circuit judge for the Ninth Circuit. I have already expressed that opposition in my vote in the Judiciary Committee, but I would like to explain this in more detail.  There are several troubling aspects of Mr. Miller's background, particularly his consistent opposition to Tribal interests and women's reproductive rights.  My State of Minnesota has a large and diverse Tribal population. I have always believed that our State history has been drawn from the culture and traditions of our Native Americans.  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, I know that Tribal sovereignty is a fundamental tenet of our laws. The Ninth Circuit is home to more federally recognized Tribes than any other circuit--more than 425. So many of the cases that come before the court involve Tribal issues. I am concerned that Mr. Miller has a history of representing interests that have sought to undermine Tribal sovereignty. For example, in a brief he filed before the Supreme Court, he urged the Court to adopt a standard that would have undermined the legitimacy of many federally recognized Tribal governments.  The National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund have come out against his confirmation. I know the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Udall, is here and understands the major concerns, since he is the ranking member of the Indian Affairs Committee, and how important that concern is. It is only the third time in the history of these two organizations--the National Congress of American Indians and the Native American Rights Fund--that they have opposed a judicial nominee.  In their letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, they wrote that Eric Miller ``chose to build a law practice on mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands, religious freedom, and the core attribute of Federal recognition of Tribal existence.''  I believe we need judges, particularly on the Ninth Circuit, who respect the history and contribution of Tribal nations, not one who seeks to undermine their sovereign status.  Mr. Miller's record on women's reproductive rights is no less troubling. During his time at the Justice Department, he used ideological language in cases in which he advocated for restrictions on a woman's personal healthcare decisions. I am concerned about what this says about how Mr. Miller will approach these types of cases.  Finally, it pains me to say that this is a historic moment for this body--for the Senate--because of how we came to be here today. It is not historic in a good sense of the word. It is historic in a bad sense of the word. We are voting on this nomination today because of an unprecedented disregard for the Senate's traditions when it comes to judicial nominations. According to the Congressional Research Service, no judge has ever been confirmed without having both blue slips returned by both home State Senators until now. We have had instances where one blue slip was returned, and the judge went on to be confirmed, but what we have here is not one blue slip from either of the home State Senators from the State of Washington was returned.  Senator Cantwell, who also, by the way, has been a major leader when it comes to Tribal matters, did not return a blue slip for Mr. Miller. Senator Murray, a major leader when it comes to women's rights, did not return a blue slip for Mr. Miller.  In the rush to confirm judges like Mr. Miller, the Judiciary Committee has chipped away at the traditions and rules that allow us to properly advise and consent on nominations, which is our responsibility specifically enumerated in the Constitution.  This goes beyond disregarding the voices of home State Senators on judicial nominations. This nominee's hearing was held during a monthlong recess with no Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee. Since this was an established work period at home, only two Republican Members were in attendance. Mr. Miller's questioning lasted for less than 5 minutes for a lifetime appointment. Why would you have this hearing at a time when we were scheduled to be working in our home States? That is what happened because it was rammed through the Senate without the support of either of the home State Senators.  At a time when the American people see this body shirking its responsibilities to act as a check and balance on the executive branch, and when they see us divided on the basic question of whether Congress has the power of the purse, I am concerned about what message we are sending to the country and the world about the health of this Senate.  This is a lifetime appointment. It should at least have had a normal hearing. We should have at least respected the views of the home State Senators as we have so many times in the past. There are no winners in a race to the bottom when it comes to process in the Senate--a democratic process, a process of advice and consent, a process of checks and balances set up by our Founders so no one branch of government would have all the power.  What do we see happening now? We see judges being put forward without blue slips. What that simply means is, the home State Senators are OK with that nominee. We have had blue slips over the years in many administrations for judges who perhaps were not the first choice of the home State Senators, but they were someone they felt could be a judge out of their State who would have the right experience as well as be fair and impartial in the administrative law.  What else do we have going on? We have a President who, after an agreement was reached in the Senate, which is run by his own political party, on how to do border security--and it was a widespread vote in both the Senate and the House--he then decided to declare an emergency to do something which I consider unconstitutional and has no respect for the balance of powers. He decided he would declare an emergency, when, in fact, those kinds of emergencies are things like Hurricane Sandy and the weather we saw, and the damage down in Florida, or the wildfires we saw in Colorado and in California. Those are emergencies. In addition to that, it raises eminent domain issues at the border.  It also makes us question where the money is coming from. That is why you see these lawsuits. The money is coming from the military budget, military construction for our troops, and the like.  While this may seem like a very different issue, it is not a different issue. It is the same issue. The Senate should be sticking up for the individual States we represent and the power of those States and the power of that balance that is so important to running this government and to the very Constitution that guides us.  I yield the floor."

Such Senate traditions as the blue slip, where the nominee's home State Senators are given an opportunity to object--this courtesy has been in place for more than 100 years as part of the Senate's advice and consent responsibility.  If confirmed, Mr. Miller would be the first circuit court nominee in history to be confirmed without having a blue slip returned from either of his home State Senators. The lack of respect shown for this Senate tradition by the Republican leadership of the Judiciary Committee is as saddening as it is alarming.  Another Senate tradition again flouted by the majority was holding Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during a Senate recess. The recess hearing--lasting only 30 minutes, with only two Republican Members in attendance--was objected to by Democratic Members who sought to question Mr. Miller on a number of legal issues, including Indian law. Instead, the questioning lasted less than 5 minutes.  Bringing Mr. Miller's nomination to the floor without an adequate hearing is an abuse of the confirmation process by the Republican leadership of the Judiciary Committee.  Putting aside these abuses of the process, as significant as they are, Mr. Miller's repeated willingness to side against Native American Tribes in court and the likelihood that such willingness will follow him to the bench where he would have an outsized influence on the development of Indian law for decades, concerns me deeply.  As vice chair of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I pay special attention to a nominee's record on Tribal issues, especially if a nominee will preside in a jurisdiction that has 427 Tribal nations, as is the case with Mr. Miller. I am concerned that Mr. Miller's record has not shown and does not have the proper respect for Tribal sovereignty.  As an attorney in private practice, Mr. Miller consistently advocated against Tribal interests and Tribal sovereignty. In fact, Mr. Miller has donated over 675 hours of pro bono work against Tribal sovereignty, against Native American religious practices, Federal recognition, and numerous other respected Tribal doctrines.  For example, in the case of Upper Skagit v. Lundgren, Mr. Miller argued that Tribal governments are not entitled to sovereign immunity because it interferes with the ``State's sovereign interest in adjudicating disputes over title to land within their territory and frustrate[s] the ordinary adjudication of competing [ownership] claims.'' His arguments in this case demonstrate he does not understand the inherent sovereignty of Tribal nations.  Mr. Miller has shown a lack of respect for Native American religious practitioners when he argued for a narrow application of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act when these practitioners argued that the construction of a solar farm would substantially burden their ability to conduct their religious practices.  Mr. Miller has argued for an extremely narrow reading of the Indian Reorganization Act when considering the Federal recognition status of Tribes. He asserts that only Tribes that possessed federally managed lands when the act was passed in 1934 should be federally recognized. This narrow view does not acknowledge the well-established principles of Indian law and can lead to the termination of Tribal nations that do not meet his narrow and arbitrary standard.  Mr. Miller's record on Tribal issues is one-sided and extreme. His history of advocating against Tribal interests does not give me confidence that he would be a fair and impartial jurist on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when Tribes come before him.  I will vote no on Eric Miller's confirmation. I urge my colleagues to do so as well.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, before I start with my comments, I want to associate my thoughts and views on Mr. Miller with Ranking Member Udall's points on Native American sovereignty and Mr. Miller's current job and what he has done in that."

                "speech":"Madam President, I come here today in a sad time. As I speak, about right now in Montana, a funeral is beginning for Jason Baker.  Jason was originally from Fort Benton, MT, which is a town right down the road from where I live in Big Sandy. Jason was a firefighter. Jason passed away on February 20, early in the morning. He was far, far too young--the age of 45. He had been a firefighter for 16 years with Great Falls Fire Rescue. He was incredibly talented and incredibly professional, and he was somebody who loved being a firefighter. His life of public service, whether it was helping out kids or helping out adults or helping out communities, was a part of who he was as a person.  Jason was also married to my wife's cousin Jill. They have two children, Peyton and Porter, whose hearts have to be aching. This day is a day, I am sure, that they had to have planned for the last 3 or so years after his diagnosis of stage IV lung cancer. I guess it was 2 years ago.  I have a number of memories of Jason from my days in the State legislature, when he showed up as a relatively young firefighter, to my days as a U.S. Senator, when he showed up to my offices here in Washington, DC, to advocate for firefighters' issues. More important than all of that, Jason was a friend. He happened to also be a relative. He was somebody who, when his wife's grandfather passed away and they had the funeral up in Havre, was at the height of who he was as a human being. He wasn't sick and hadn't been diagnosed with anything. He was just vibrant and full of life.  With cancer's being the disease that it is, it was a struggle for him, as it is for anybody who gets it. He was somebody who fought that disease bravely and proudly, but in the end, it took him. It took him last Wednesday, early in the morning. We were driving to Great Falls, and my wife sent a little message to Jill that read our hearts were with them because we knew that Jason wasn't good. She sent back a text with hearts, and that was it. He had already passed.  In the end, though, as I think back on Jason's life, there are some lyrics to a song that say ``Only the good die young.'' It could not be any more true than with Jason Baker. If the world were full of Jason Bakers, this would be a better world, but life happens, and you have to get through it.  I am sure that Jill and Peyton and Porter will think back and remember their dad proudly as he served proudly as a firefighter, as a public servant--as somebody who ran to danger while other people were running away from it.  As they proceed with the ceremony today in Montana--and it is happening as I speak--just know, Jill, Peyton, Porter, and all of the firefighters who are there, that we are very proud of your dad and his service and what he fought for.  Two years ago, there was a bill in the Montana Legislature on presumptive illness for firefighters. I do not believe Jason would have contracted cancer if not for his job, if not for the kinds of fumes he breathed when he protected neighborhoods and families. I think it is only right that when people sacrifice for their communities, we sacrifice for them. Two years ago, the legislature did not pass that presumptive illness bill. I think it made a mistake.  When I gave my speech to the House of Representatives in the Montana Legislature, one of the points I made in that speech was that they needed to pass the presumptive healthcare bill for firefighters. Jason was alive when I gave that speech, and now he has passed. I think, in memory of Jason Baker, at the very least, the Montana Legislature could pass that bill. I understand it has passed one of the houses but that it hasn't passed both of them. If it passes both houses, I know Governor Bullock will sign that bill.  So, with that, we bid adieu to a great American, a great community man--somebody who literally gave it all for his country and his State and his town.  We will miss you, Jason Baker.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, we are in the midst of a stealth campaign. Normally, we think about ``stealth'' as associated with bombers or submarines, weapons platforms designed to go, in effect, under the radar, to avoid detection, to escape public notice or the notice of our adversaries.  This stealth campaign is really hiding in plain sight. It is a campaign to remake our Federal judiciary in the image of the far-right extreme of the Republican Party, the far-right extreme ideologically and politically, a campaign, in effect, to outsource selections of judges to groups that reflect those extreme points of view--the Heritage Society and other such groups.  Shortly, we will consider the nomination of the latest individual nominated by the President, outsourced to those groups: Eric Miller, of Washington, to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The effort here is to drastically reshape our judiciary but, in the process, also dismantle the norms and practices critical to the health of our democracy. The judiciary is essential to the health of our democracy.  In the future, when we look back on this era--a dark and dangerous time for our democracy--the heroes will be our free press and our independent judiciary because they have been selected in the past by both Republican and Democratic Presidents based on qualities of integrity, intelligence, and independence.  That norm, common to both Republican and Democratic administrations in the past, has been broken by this one. One of the norms that has been broken in the U.S. Senate relates to the use of blue slips. Most of the public has no idea what blue slips are. They are the traditional mechanism used over decades to afford home State Senators the opportunity to express their approval or disapproval for fitness, a basic quality of a President's judicial nominee to a court that has jurisdiction over their State.  What is the reason? Well, Senators just happen to spend a lot of time talking with folks at home. We talk to farmers, businesspeople, lawyers. A lot of those lawyers know fellow lawyers. Of course, we receive the ABA qualified or unqualified ratings, but they are single words based on fact gathering that may or may not be as reliable as our colleagues--the lawyers who appear in front of judges, who go to court every day, who have settlement conferences, who rely on the word of their colleagues, which is either good or bad, who know their integrity and intelligence, who know whether they have the temperament to sit in judgment of cases that will have enduring and irreparable ramifications for the litigants who appear in front of them.  Respecting the blue-slip tradition ensures that when there is a Federal judicial vacancy--for Connecticut, for example--that the President nominate a qualified candidate from Connecticut with the advice and consent of Connecticut Senators. The same is true for the Presiding Officer's home State of Tennessee or any of the other States involved here. I am sure my colleagues from Texas or North Carolina or wherever would want a Democratic President to consult them when making appointments to the courts that have jurisdiction over the people, the litigants, the folks who have to go to court with their grievances in their States. Blue slips may be a courtesy, but they are important to the functioning of our society.  Until the Trump administration, only five judges had ever been confirmed with only one blue slip in the last 100 years. That means one Senator from that State objected. Only five went through with that one objection and with the other Senator saying OK.  To our knowledge, no judge has ever been confirmed without having both blue slips from their home State Senators. Eric Miller would be a first.  Sometimes it is good to be a first but not so here. We are witnessing another norm being shattered in realtime. We need to know from the majority: Is this the road we really want to go down in this Chamber?  I take my constitutional responsibilities very seriously, especially when it comes to the confirmation of judges, as someone who has spent most of my professional career in the courtroom, either as a lawyer in private practice or a U.S. attorney for Connecticut or as attorney general in my State for 20 years.  This issue is important because not only is it a matter of courtesy, but it is a matter of completeness.  This nomination is a stealth nomination in a very important sense, also, as far as the process for his confirmation is concerned. Only one Senator--one Senator--has actually asked him questions on the record in public. That is because his confirmation hearing was scheduled at a time when only one Member of the U.S. Senate was there to ask him questions.  It was held during a month-long recess in October. Only two members of the committee--Senators Hatch and Crapo--could attend the hearing. Only Senator Crapo questioned Mr. Miller for a 5-minute round of questions.  All 10 Democratic members of the Judiciary, including me, wrote to Senator Grassley to have the hearing rescheduled. We asked, and he refused. We wrote Senator Grassley again to have a second hearing so that the full committee could provide advice and consent after questioning Mr. Miller's nomination. We had no success.  If Mr. Miller is confirmed, he will have been questioned by that one Senator, Mr. Crapo--out of 100--for a grand total of 5 minutes. That is not the way this system should work.  I do take my constitutional responsibilities seriously. This process makes a sham of the obligations we all have a sworn duty to fulfill.  In conclusion, let me say that in November of 2018, the Ninth Circuit ruled against the President. He described that case as ``a disgrace.'' He painted the ruling of the Ninth Circuit as biased by describing one of the judges as an ``Obama judge.'' President Trump ultimately stated that the Ninth Circuit is ``not fair'' because every case the administration files in the Ninth Circuit results in a loss.  He has made no secret of his frustration about judges generally, whether they were chosen by Republican or Democratic Presidents in the past. He has made no secret of his contempt for judges who uphold the rule of law and, as Chief Justice Roberts said, ``do equal right to those appearing before them.''  Chief Justice Roberts also stated that an ``independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.''  The nomination of Eric Miller betrays that essential principle of the American judiciary. It diminishes and reduces the independence of our judiciary at a level that we can ill afford and at a time when independence is most important. I think this nomination is particularly objectionable in light of that lack of independence.  Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by the National Congress of American Indians, the Native American Rights Fund, Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, and NARAL Pro-Choice America because of positions he has taken. Those positions are also objectionable to me, but what is most important is his lack of independence, the lack of proper process in his confirmation, and his lack of qualifications for this job.  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against him today.  Thank you.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the nomination of Eric Miller to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  As an attorney and former attorney general, like my good colleague from Connecticut, I have a deep respect and appreciation for our Federal judiciary. I believe that carefully guarding the professional reputation of our Federal bench is critical to maintaining respect for the rule of law in our country.  The American people must be able to trust that our Federal judges will be fair and neutral arbiters of any dispute before them. So in considering whether a nominee is deserving of the awesome responsibility of a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, we must carefully evaluate their professional and personal qualifications to ensure that they are of the highest intellectual, professional, and moral caliber.  I have carefully reviewed Mr. Miller's record, and I believe that he is the wrong candidate to fill this judicial seat. I believe my Republican colleagues know it. That is why they have made every effort to jam this confirmation through.  The majority-led Judiciary Committee and Republican leadership have taken extraordinary steps to rush this nomination. Republicans held Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during an October recess, without the consent of minority members of the committee, questioning him for just 5 minutes and then gaveling out. As you heard, only two Senators were at that hearing. That is not regular order in the Senate.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership continues to attack regular order in the Senate by attacking Senate precedent. This nominee, if confirmed, will be the first circuit court judge advanced without the support of either of their home State Senators. That is the blue-slip process.  The blue-slip process is an essential tradition of respecting the wishes of each nominee's home State Senators, and it is the start of the advice and consent process.  This is about our system of checks and balances, respecting one another, and the prerogatives of the Senate that ensure every Senator has a voice in the selection of judges in their home State. This institutional check has never been more important than it is today because we have a President who undermines the legitimacy and impartiality of the courts.  By bringing up this confirmation for a vote before the Senate, Republican leaders are circumventing Senators, ignoring the people we were elected to represent, and damaging our critical role in appropriately deliberating on lifetime judicial nominees and representing the will of our constituents who elected us. This is a dereliction of the Senate's duty, and it is an assault on our institutions.  If confirmed, Mr. Miller will have a lifetime appointment to one of the highest courts in America. He will make decisions on our Nation's most important issues and will have the power to change Americans' lives. Yet this Republican leadership believes a 5-minute hearing is enough for a circuit court nominee who doesn't have the support of his own home State Senators.  When the confirmation process is rushed like this, critical information about the history and character of the nominees will be missed. These lapses undermine the integrity of our confirmation process and ultimately undermine the public's faith in our Federal judiciary.  I share many of the same concerns of Senators Cantwell and Murray about Mr. Miller's views on Tribal sovereignty and other critical issues. Mr. Miller's past work in undermining Tribal sovereignty and Tribal rights raises questions about how he would treat Tribes who come before him as a circuit court judge. His confirmation could have serious ramifications for Native communities in Washington, Nevada, and across the country.  Each one of us is elected to represent our State and its people. Today's move by the majority is nothing less than an assault on our oath to the Constitution and our duty to serve our constituents. I urge my colleagues to vote no on this nomination and stand together in a bipartisan way to confirm nominees who reflect our States, our country, and respect the Senators.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I am here joining my colleagues on the floor to sound the alarm because right now, this Senate is being steered down a very dangerous path. I spoke last night about this and laid out my case, and I am here again to make it one more time.  Republican leaders are now barreling toward a confirmation vote on a Ninth Circuit nominee--a flashpoint that, if it succeeds, will mark a massive departure from the longstanding bipartisan process that has been in place for generations. It is a bipartisan process that has helped this Senate put consensus nominees on the bench for as long as we have all been here. This is wrong, and it is the American people who we represent who will be hurt.  Let's recap the facts. Neither I nor my colleague Senator Cantwell returned a blue slip on the nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Circuit court. I have deep concerns about Mr. Miller's work fighting against Tribes. Despite our objections, Republicans went ahead with Mr. Miller's confirmation hearing during a Senate recess when just two Senators--both Republicans--were able to attend, and the hearing included less than 5 minutes of questioning. It was a sham hearing. It was simply done to check the box.  For this Senate to go ahead and confirm this Ninth Circuit court nominee without the consent of or true input from both home State Senators and after a sham hearing--that would be a dangerous first for this Senate.  This is not a partisan issue; this is a question of this Senate's ability and commitment to properly review nominees.  The only logical conclusion I can draw as to why we are here at these crossroads is that Republican leaders are hoping that most Americans won't notice, that they are doing everything in their power to pander to President Trump and in doing that are trampling all over Senate norms in order to move our courts to the far right.  We are standing here today because this is too important and because the short- and long-term consequences of letting any President steamroll the Senate on something as critical as our judicial nominees are far too important.  Abandoning the blue-slip process and instead bending to the will of a President, by the way, who has demonstrated time and again his ignorance and disdain for the Constitution and rule of law is a mistake. At a time when we have a President whose policies keep testing the limits of the law--from a ban on Muslims entering the United States, to a family separation policy at our southern border, to declaring a national emergency without a real emergency--it is now more important than ever that we have well-qualified, consensus judges on the bench.  This new precedent of my Republican colleagues turning a blind eye to the blue slip and shunning longstanding bipartisan processes should stop every one of my colleagues, Republican or Democratic, in their tracks because today the two home State Senators left holding their blue slips are me and my colleague Senator Cantwell, but in the future, it could be any Member of this body. Today it is Washington State families who are getting cut out from an important process. It is their concerns about Eric Miller's long history of fighting against Tribal rights that will be cast aside. But tomorrow it could be the concerns of any of your constituents and any of your home States that get tossed aside for a President's crusade to reshape our courts and satisfy their political base, and it could be your constituents and your home States hurt by Senate leaders unwilling to stand up for norms and precedents and our constitutional duty.  Again, I am here today to urge my colleagues to truly think about what moving ahead with this nomination means and to ask themselves, are we still able to work together in a bipartisan way and find common ground for the good of the country and the people we serve? Can we still even engage in a bipartisan process to find consensus candidates to serve on our courts, or will our work in the Senate be reduced to partisan extremes and political gamesmanship? Will Republicans accept simply being a rubberstamp for their leader in the White House? Will my colleagues be complicit in allowing our courts to be taken over by ideology alone, abandoning pragmatism and a commitment to justice for all? That is a choice every Senator faces now and, I sincerely hope, a choice for which every Senator will be held accountable.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise this evening to speak on a subject that, with the groundswell of activism, has once again captured national attention--and rightfully so.  Many years ago, I was a young naval flight officer stationed at a mock field naval air station in the Bay area out in California, preparing for the first of what would be three tours of duty in Southeast Asia during the Vietnam war. I joined there with tens of thousands of people one day to celebrate our country's first-ever Earth Day. I will never forget it.  This was back when polluters dumped waste into our waterways with impunity. Garbage littered our shores, and too many rivers oozed instead of flowed. One of them was in Cleveland, OH. The Cuyahoga River, north of where I went to school at Ohio State, actually caught on fire. Factories spewed toxic fumes, and acid rain fell from the sky. The urgency was clear then, and it is even clearer today.  That very first Earth Day was a transformative experience for me, and it will serve as an inspiration for me for the rest of my life.  As I look at what is happening across our country today, I see the movement for bold and transformative action to save our planet. I see the faces of those who were there with me that day in Golden Gate State Park.  I have had a lot of different jobs since then, but it is not lost on me that I stand here today on the brink of yet another watershed moment as the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works--the committee that oversees our Nation's environmental laws--to talk about climate change.  In the days and weeks ahead, Senator McConnell intends to engage in a ploy to try and undermine the Green New Deal by calling a vote for a resolution he does not even support. I believe he hopes that, in turn, there may be some disruption and damage inflicted on the Democratic Party and the climate change movement.  To the American people, hear this; it is a simple message: We cannot--we will not--allow cynicism to win, not now and not with so much at stake.  When it comes to climate action, there could not be a starker difference in this Chamber between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party in this debate.  We, as Democrats, may not agree on exactly how we should address climate change, but we all agree it is happening. We agree that human activity is the main cause, and we agree that we must act now.  Democrats know that climate science isn't part of some grand hoax. It is not an alarmist prediction. It doesn't come from some left-leaning organization. It doesn't come from talk radio. It comes directly from our Nation's leading scientists and leading scientists from all around the world.  Just 3 months ago, 13 Federal Agencies released a comprehensive climate report that described the dire economic and health consequences we face if we fail to take meaningful action to address climate change now. I may be mistaken, but I believe those 13 Federal Agencies were acting under law signed by a Republican President. I believe it was George Herbert Walker Bush.  This report is the Fourth National Climate Assessment. It was developed over a 3-year period by more than 300 Federal experts and non-Federal experts who volunteered their time--who volunteered their time.  Here is a brief summary of their report: The science behind climate change is settled. Let me say that again. The science behind climate change is settled.  From our warming oceans to our atmosphere, climate change is happening, and human activity, such as burning fossil fuels, is greatly contributing to this crisis.  Our Nation's scientists have found a direct link between climate change and the extreme weather we experienced in 2017, which altogether cost the American economy more than $300 billion--that is $300 billion in economic damages, more than any year before.  Scientists are no longer asking if climate change is happening but rather how bad is it going to be. How bad is it going to be? Numbers and the facts don't lie. It will only get worse if we do nothing.  If we don't act on climate change by 2050, wildfire seasons could burn up to six times--six times--more forest area every year. If we don't act on climate change, we will see more extreme flooding that devastates small communities like Ellicott City, MD, not far from here, which has been hit by not one 1,000-year flood in the past year but two. These are floods that are supposed to occur maybe once every 1,000 years. They had two of them in the last 2 years.  If we don't act on climate change, rising temperatures, combined with increasingly frequent and severe rain, mean farmers are likely to experience a reduction in corn and soybean yields by up to 25 percent. If we don't act on climate change, we will see more deadly category 5 hurricanes and storm surges like the ones we saw with Hurricanes Irma and Maria just 2 years ago.  If we do not act on climate change, we will see economic pain across every major sector of our economy in this country. The 2018 National Climate Assessment concludes that at the end of this century, climate change could slash our gross domestic product by 10 percent.  How much is that compared to what? Well, compared to the losses we sustained in the great recession just a decade ago, 10 percent is more than double those losses--more than double.  It doesn't matter if you are from a coastal State or from a landlocked State. I have lived in both. It doesn't matter if you care about public health or the environment or if you care about our economy or national security. The fact is, every person living in this country will eventually see or experience the effects of climate change if they haven't already done so today.  We have two options. We confront this challenge head on--reduce carbon emissions, enhance resiliency, and support millions of new clean energy jobs--or we could choose to ignore the problem and pass the buck. To whom? To our children, to their children, and to their children.  Senator McConnell, President Trump, and Andrew Wheeler at EPA want to pass the buck. They prefer to walk away from the growing threat we face. Instead of pursuing any ideas to address climate change and protect Americans from its effect, sadly, the Trump administration has promoted policies that increase our dependency on dirty energy.  President Trump has even said he doesn't believe in climate change. He doubts the credibility of his own scientists at NASA and at NOAA, as well as 97 percent of the global scientific community. Continuing to misinform the American people and delay real climate action puts American lives and our economy at risk.  It doesn't have to be this way. As Democrats, we choose to confront climate change. We choose to do so now. We know our communities are feeling the pain now from the climate crisis because we see the effects of climate change every day across this country.  We may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change, but we all agree on three things. Here they are. One, we agree climate change is real; two, human activity during the last 100 years is a dominant cause of the climate crisis we face today; and three, the United States, and especially the Congress, that is us, the House and the Senate, and the administration should take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change.  That is why I will be introducing a resolution that says just that. Democrats know we can have a healthy climate and a strong economy. They are not mutually exclusive. Anyone who says otherwise is preaching a false choice.  Democrats know this because of the work we started with President Obama in the White House, where we accomplished real actions to put this Nation on a path of net zero emissions. Our Republicans friends across the aisle should know this because of the work done by the former President, the late George Herbert Walker Bush, years earlier that I just alluded to a minute ago.  During the Obama administration, starting with the Recovery Act, the Federal Government provided economic incentives, environmental targets, and supported market developments to encourage investments in the clean energy of the future.  Thanks to the investments during the previous administration, consumers are paying less for energy, and more than 3 million people in this country went to work today in the clean energy sector--3 million and growing.  Democrats know we must build on this progress, and that is why we continue to support policies that reduce our Nation's carbon footprint, help create a fair economy, and support those most vulnerable to climate effects, but in the U.S. Senate, as in most places, it takes two to tango, and for over two decades Democrats have put forth different policies that use market forces, make big investments in technology, or set strict standards. We have done them all, and we don't seem to get very far with our friends on the other side of this aisle. I know because I have cosponsored many of these efforts.  Let me just say this. We are not going to give up. We are going to keep on trying. We will not back down. We are going to stand our ground.  Let me leave our colleagues with this message today. This should not be an issue. Climate action should not be an issue that divides us as a body. It shouldn't divide us as a country or as a world. It should unify us.  I thank Senator McConnell in advance for allowing the Senate to devote a fulsome period of time to this important discussion. How we choose to act today will not decide our fates. How we choose to act today will decide the fates of generations of Americans--not just our fates but generations of Americans that will be on this Earth long after the rest of us are gone. So let's get to work. Time is wasting. Let's get to work.  I yield the floor to the Senator from Massachusetts, who has done great work on this for as long as I have been alive--almost as long as I have been alive, my friend and my colleague who has been a giant on these issues for a long time and continues to be.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I thank our great leader on the Environment Committee for his visionary work on this issue. I am here for the same purpose today. I am here to talk about climate change, about our climate crisis, and about the mistake it would be to put Andrew Wheeler in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and to the planet. We know this because the world's leading scientists, the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, just made that warning late last year. It is an existential threat to the planet.  The U.N. report told us we have very limited time until we are past the point of no return, and the most catastrophic impacts of climate change are irreversible.  Our own Federal scientists across 13 Agencies also just warned in the National Climate Assessment that the impacts of climate change are not in the future, but they are happening in our communities right now.  Here is what all 13 U.S. Federal Agencies said. They said our efforts do not yet approach the scale necessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, environment, and human health. These are Earth-shattering reports about the state of our Earth. These are the doomsday reports about what happens if we do not take bold action.  The dire consequences of climate change, in fact, are arriving. A tenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic, 99 percent loss of coral reefs, and a doubling of species lost around the world. In the Northeast, in worst-case scenarios, by the end of the century, both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be under water, and over 20 percent of Boston's population will face flood risk.  The climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, emissions increased 2.8 percent. We have the ``Denier in Chief'' in the White House, and this week Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency.  During his confirmation hearing, when I asked whether he agreed with the conclusions of the National Climate Assessment report, Mr. Wheeler said he still needed additional briefings before he could make a public comment on it. Let me repeat that. The nominee of Donald Trump to run the Agency charged with protecting the planet from climate change had not even sufficiently reviewed the climate report from our own Federal Agencies before his confirmation hearing. He also said he considered the report to be a representation of the worst-case scenario and that what we face is ``a climate issue.''  Well, the worst-case scenario is one in which the Republican Senate will confirm a former coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency. The worst-case scenario is the Trump administration's plans to roll back the Clean Power Plan and the fuel economy emission standards, the single largest steps we have ever taken to address climate change. We are in a worst-case scenario, and we need to dramatically change course.  That should start by not confirming Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, to run the Agency charged with protecting our planet. Andrew Wheeler's answers on the climate crisis should be disqualifying. His record as a coal lobbyist should be disqualifying. We should come together and reject Andrew Wheeler as the head of the EPA.  The impact of climate change on ordinary families on their health, on our Nation, on our security, and on our future is too urgent. We must be bold. We must be ambitious.  That is why I have introduced the Green New Deal resolution. It lays out a serious, bold, aspirational set of goals that meet the scale of the threat we are facing. It is a set of principles, not prescriptions. The Green New Deal will allow us to engage in massive job creation to save all of creation. It calls for a massive 10-year mobilization to transform our climate, our economy, our democracy. It is about jobs and justice.  An overwhelming number of Americans support climate action, and a majority of Americans support a Green New Deal. Never in our history have the interests of all Americans been so united in a single issue: climate change.  From the air we breathe to the jobs that employ us, to the neighborhoods we live in, to the economy we operate within, climate change defines our existence. This is the time for serious solutions. Global temperatures are the highest in recorded history. Wealth inequality is at its highest point since the era of the Great Depression. The erosion of our coastlines, the erosion of earning power of workers, the pollution of our planet, the pollution of our democracy by Big Oil and Koch brothers financing, the relationship between these ills and injustices is undeniable, but the challenge is not insurmountable.  It will only be through a historic intergenerational commitment to end climate change that we create the kind of democracy that works for all Americans. This Green New Deal mobilization will make the United States the global leader on clean energy and climate action.  This mobilization will be the greatest blue-collar jobs program in a generation. This mobilization will be an opportunity to repair the historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities that have borne the worst burdens of pollution from our fossil fuel economy--these communities that also will be the most affected and the least able to respond to the impacts of climate change. The Green New Deal represents an opportunity to lift up all workers and all communities.  President Roosevelt was right when he said about the New Deal that ``statesmanship and vision, my friends, require relief to all at the same time.''  We are talking about a historic, 10-year mobilization that will mitigate climate emissions and build climate resiliency. We have acted on this scale before, and we must do it again.  We have already laid the foundation for our climate future. In 2008, we had only 1,200 megawatts of total solar capacity in the United States. Today, we have 65,000 megawatts. In 2008, we had only 25,000 megawatts of total wind capacity. Today, we have 98,000 megawatts of wind capacity. In 2008, there were only 2,500 all-electric vehicles in our country. Today, we have 1 million, with 500,000 new all-electric vehicles to be sold this year. Most of all, what we have seen over the past 10 years is a growing movement for climate action. In wind and solar, we now have 350,000 people who are employed. That didn't happen 10 years ago; it is happening today.  The Green New Deal is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. Republicans and climate deniers are taking mathematical liberties to say it would cost too much to act, but the cost of inaction on climate will be far higher. Over just the past 2 years, the cost of storms and the cost of fires in our country created over $400 billion in damages. By the end of this century, it will be tens of trillions of dollars that we will lose. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we start today, we can avoid the worst, most catastrophic consequences. For those who say we can't afford to act to address this crisis, I say we can't afford not to.  The question is, Will any Republican stand up to fight for these goals? The Republican Party is about to confirm a coal lobbyist to run the Environmental Protection Agency. That is where we are in 2019, with the worst scientific reports coming from the U.N. and our own scientists--a threat of an existential risk for the planet--and we are about to confirm a coal lobbyist.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have to be bold the way President Kennedy was in 1962 when he called for a mission to the Moon to be accomplished within 10 years. He said it would not be easy. He said we would have to invent metal that did not exist and propulsion systems that did not exist. He said we would have to bring that mission back safely through heat half the intensity of the Sun, and we would have to do so safely within 10 years so that we could control outer space. We did that, ladies and gentlemen, and we can do it again.  We have to accept this challenge. We can do it. We can unleash an innovation revolution in our country, and again we will do it to save all creation by engaging in massive job creation, a blue-collar revolution hiring millions of workers to do this job.  I thank you, Madam President. This is a very important week before us.  I yield back to my colleague."

                "speech":"It goes the other way.  Sometimes it seems that our friends on the other side of the aisle think that the only people who are watching this conversation are fossil fuel industry lobbyists and CEOs and electioneers.  So we are going through, shortly, a truly preposterous exercise on the floor of the Senate, which is that a party that has brought up no significant legislation in the time that Leader McConnell has had the floor is now going to bring its first measure related to climate for a floor vote, and it is something they intend to vote against. It is something they intend to vote against. When you bring a measure to the floor that it is your intention to vote against, that is not legislating. Something else is going on.  Now I think this was a very clever stunt. We don't know quite where it was cooked up, but we have observed that the Wall Street Journal editorial page is a relentless mouthpiece for the fossil fuel industry, having published climate denial articles literally within the last year. The Wall Street Journal editorial page called for this stunt vote, and it was less than 24 hours before the Republicans in the Senate jumped up, scampered out, and did exactly what they were told to do by the fossil fuel industry's mouthpiece, the Wall Street Journal editorial page.  I am sure there were champagne corks banging into the ceilings of the boardrooms for ExxonMobil, Americans for Prosperity, and the Koch Industries as all of these fossil fuel executives and lobbyists cheered this stunt. But in the Senate, we actually have a larger audience than just fossil fuel donors; the country is watching and the world is watching, and what they are seeing right now is, frankly, an embarrassment.  It is not just this stunt that reflects a broken Senate; it is a much larger problem of a Senate that cannot deal with the climate change issue in a bipartisan fashion.  I would state that when I got here in 2007, the Senate could deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2008, the Senate could deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. In 2009, the Senate could deal with climate change in a bipartisan fashion. The reason I know that is because I was here then, and I saw as many as five bipartisan efforts to deal with climate change during that period, with different Republican and Democratic Senators. Then along came the Citizens United decision in January 2010, and from that moment after, it was like watching a patient drop dead in the emergency room. The heartbeat of activity on climate change just flatlined on the Republican side of this Chamber.  I think the fossil fuel industry--I know the fossil fuel industry asked for that decision from the Supreme Court and the five Republican Justices. I think they anticipated what the decision was going to be, and they immediately went to work to squelch and crush any dissent from their orthodoxy on that side of the aisle. The result has been that there has been no significant piece of climate legislation to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and to deal with this problem since Citizens United that any of our colleagues now will cosponsor or support. It has just been silent, and it is a dramatic failure in this greatest deliberative body.  I will state, as others have stated, as Ranking Member Carper and Senator Markey have said, that the science on this is now beyond dispute. The science on this is irrefutable. If we fail to deal with this problem, the consequences will be catastrophic and irreversible.  ``Irrefutable science.'' ``Catastrophic and irreversible consequences.'' I am actually quoting somebody when I say that. Do you know whom I am quoting? I am quoting from 2009 Donald Trump--Donald Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and the Trump Organization signed this full-page advertisement in the New York Times in 2009. ``If we fail to act now,'' they said, ``it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.'' So as much as the fossil fuel-funded mockery in which the Republican Party has engaged, challenges these facts, even the Trumps knew this a decade ago.  In trying to describe the Green New Deal, one might describe it as something that, if you invested in it, would ``drive state-of-the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at risk.'' That is a pretty good capsule of the Green New Deal.  Guess what Donald Trump and his family said in the same advertisement.       Investing in a Clean Energy Economy will drive state-of-     the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create      new energy jobs, and increase our energy security all while      reducing the harmful emissions that are putting our planet at      risk.  All you have to do is listen to the 2009 Donald Trump to understand that the science of climate change was then irrefutable and it is even stronger now and that the consequences of our failure to act and our obedience, our adherence to fossil fuel-funded propaganda and orthodoxy will lead to consequences that are catastrophic and irreversible--said a decade ago. We have had 10 more years of unrestricted emissions since then.  Just the basic tenets of the Green New Deal are ``a clean energy economy [that] will drive state-of-the-art technologies that will spur economic growth, create new energy jobs, and increase our energy security.''  With the words of Donald Trump, I rest my case and yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, think about what we just heard, first from Senator Markey talking about a fossil fuel lobbyist in the year 2019 being chosen to head the EPA--a fossil fuel lobbyist--when there has not been a bill on this floor or any motion coming from Senator McConnell to deal with climate change, to deal with one of the greatest if not the greatest moral issue of our times--nothing on this floor. You heard what Senator Markey said. This administration has done nothing to address this issue, and President Trump selects a fossil fuel lobbyist to be head of the EPA. It is the same thing over and over again.  We have to take aggressive action to protect our planet and protect our future now. That means accelerating our transition to carbon-free power. It means investing in technologies that make our manufacturers the most energy efficient in the world. It means creating jobs in clean energy all around the country.  I have always, as a House Member living in Lorain, OH, and as a Member of the Senate--for years, I have always refused to accept the idea that you have to choose between good environmental policy and good-paying jobs. We have proved that is simply not true. We have proved it in my State, where we have lots of wind turbines, made usually with American-made steel. We have proved it in Toledo, where we have one of the biggest solar energy manufacturers in the country. We proved it in the auto industry, where the auto industry has generally had a pretty good decade making more fuel-efficient cars. We put Americans to work, and we can change course on climate change before it is too late.  Mitch McConnell and President Trump seem to think climate change--that is notwithstanding what Senator Whitehouse said--is a joke. I have news for them. Climate change is not something to play political games with; it is a crisis we need to confront and set an example around the world. It is a crisis we need to confront and to set an example for our partners around the world.  It would be shameful enough to have no ideas and no plan to confront our biggest threats. But not only do President Trump and Leader McConnell have no plan, not only are they denying the problem, and not only are they standing in the way of solutions, but they are actually working to make climate change worse. It is just despicable.  They are spreading lies and stacking the administration with shills for the fossil fuel industry. They stacked the administration with Wall Street cronies to do bank regulation. They stacked the administration with fossil fuel cronies and shills to do energy and climate and environmental regulation.  We got news this week that the White House is going to use your taxpayer dollars to set up a panel to promote junk science and spread the debunked conspiracy theory that climate change is a hoax.  This week we will vote on the President's nominee to head the EPA, a lobbyist who would be overseeing the same special interests who have paid his salary. Andrew Wheeler is just the latest in a long line of cronies from the fossil fuel industry who President Trump has put in charge at the EPA and the Department of the Interior.  Climate change is not a future problem. It does damage to this country right now. It is threatening thousands of Ohio workers who rely on Lake Erie for their livelihood, whether it is tourism or other industries that rely on clean water.  Climate change makes algal blooms worse. Off the shores of Toledo, it contaminates our lake, threatens our drinking water, and hurts small business. Nobody on that side of the aisle seems to give a darn.  I have talked to farmers who have been farming in the Western Lake Erie Basin for decades. They tell me they are experiencing heavier rain events more often and with greater intensity compared to even 15 years ago. Hotter summers and shorter winters will only make this problem worse.  It is time for the President of the United States to stop sabotaging the country he is supposed to lead. It is past time to rejoin the Paris Agreement, to restart the Clean Power Plan, and to implement aggressive fuel economy standards for cars and trucks. It is time to create new jobs in clean energy and energy-efficient manufacturing. It is time for the United States to be the leader the world looks to. It is time to take this threat seriously to preserve our country for our children, and their children, and their children's children before it is too late. Madam President, yesterday we saw yet another attempt by Republican politicians to put themselves in the middle of the sacred doctor-patient relationship and to take away the freedom of women to make their own healthcare decisions. Supporters of this bill, including President Trump, have spread lies and they spread misinformation.  This bill is about intimidating doctors. It is about making it harder for women to get comprehensive care, and they simply don't care. It is despicable.  That is why doctors and medical experts oppose this bill. Let me give you a few: the American College of Nurse-Midwives, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's Association, the American Public Health Association, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Association of Physician Assistants in Obstetrics and Gynecology. The list goes on and on.  Yet President Trump and most Republican politicians--most Republican Members of the Senate--think they know better than you and your doctor. It is nothing new. We have seen it over and over. Washington politicians--most of them men--are obsessed with trying to insert themselves into women's private healthcare decisions. They just can't help themselves. But those decisions should be and are between a woman and her doctor--period. That is why we defeated this bill yesterday. It is why I will always support women's freedom to make their own healthcare decisions.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

It was just about an hour or so ago that the House took up the bill that we had passed out of the Senate here, our lands and water conservation bill, which was a very significant measure of about 120 different conservation, lands, waters, and sportsmen's bills--all rolled into one package--that passed out of here by 92 to 8. It just passed out of the House by a significant, significant margin.  It is, I think, a real testament not only to the work that has been done within this body on a very strong bipartisan basis but, really, to the work that we have done with the House, in our working with the other body in a bipartisan, bicameral way.

                "speech":"Madam President, as I stand before you, we are facing a financial calamity that could make the last financial crisis look like the good old days. I have become aware of a committee of respected financial industry experts that has developed a Debt Default Clock, which conceptualizes the risk associated with a potential Federal debt crisis that leads to the insolvency of the government. The Debt Default Clock is the same concept as the famous Doomsday Clock, only in this case illustrating how close we are to fiscal meltdown.  The Debt Default Clock has 12 factors that are used to measure the risk associated with the burgeoning Federal debt. The Clock currently stands at 4 minutes to midnight, which means that insolvency of the Federal Government is close at hand, and we have little time to act. Although the 12 criteria were developed on the basis of defining the circumstances leading to government insolvency and default, they were also created with the idea of identifying metrics that can be measured, watched, and compared over time to identify the time remaining before the sequence of insolvency and default. Eight of these factors are already in negative territory, and the others are moving in that direction.  In 2010, I ran for the Senate out of concern that our out-of-control debt might finally take us off the cliff. It is frustration with rampant, deficit-financed spending that sparked the Tea Party; yet the situation continues to get worse. So I urge my colleagues to find out more about the Debt Default Clock and the role of Congress, the administration, and the States as to how each of the factors might be mitigated if the political will exists to do so before calamity hits us square in the face.  Accordingly, I respectfully request that the following information related to the Debt Default Clock be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: "

Known as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World, the Grand Canyon is more than history to Arizona, it is a part of who we are. Millions of visitors come to see this magnificent national park, from its archeological sites to its one-of-a-kind trails; and for centuries, this vast array of canyons and mountains has served as a home to many different peoples, including many Native American tribes.  It was in 1869 that geologist John Wesley Powell first led an expedition down the hazardous Colorado River, during which he noted the ancient clues he found hidden in the layers of rock that told the story of its creation. His expedition led to future explorations further chartering and mapping the great canyon. By the time it officially became a National Park in 1919, the Grand Canyon attracted some 44,000 visitors. Today, Arizona hosts more than 6 million visitors each year, and with a total economic impact of almost $1 billion a year, it is the greatest attraction in our State.

The Fort Smith Noon Lions Club first met on March 8, 1919, only 2 years after the creation of Lions Club International. With 25 charter members, the club's mission was to encourage fellowship and civic participation by local businessmen. Many prominent business leaders were part of that founding group, including Dr. Charles Holt, founder of Holt Crock Clinic; Fagan Bourland, who served as the city's mayor for many years; and W.E. Harding, the founder of Harding Glass, one of the city's largest companies at the time.  The club met for many years at the historic Goldman Hotel in downtown Fort Smith and, later, at the Ward Hotel on Garrison Avenue. Among its earliest projects was supporting the Victory Loan Campaign designed to pay off debt from WWI. In the early days, it held festivals, hosted free concerts, and played an annual baseball game against the local Rotary Club.  In addition to supporting local causes and providing a networking tool for businessmen, the club's mission came into focus after Helen Keller spoke at the Lions Club International convention in 1925. She concluded her speech by saying, ``I appeal to you Lions, you who have your sight, your hearing, you who are strong and brave and kind. Will you not constitute yourselves Knights of the Blind in this crusade against darkness?'' Her eloquent plea transformed the Lions and made sight conservation the organization's primary mission.  Throughout its 100-year history, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has contributed greatly to this mission by raising money to provide eye exams and glasses to local students and adults. Lions Club members have also collected thousands of pairs of glasses which are donated to the Southern College of Optometry in Memphis where students take the glasses on international mission trips.  In recent years, the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club has donated more than $100,000 to help local residents with sight preservation and provided support to many local children's organizations including the Fort Smith Boys Club, Good Samaritan Clinic, Clearinghouse Backpack Program, Special Olympics, and the Children's Emergency Shelter.  In addition, the club has provided all of the equipment and support needed for the Safety Patrol program in the Fort Smith Public Schools since 1946.  As an optometrist whose hometown is Fort Smith, AR, I am proud of the great work done by this club and Lions chapters around the world.  I congratulate the Fort Smith Noon Lions Club on its 100th anniversary and hope that these Knights for the Blind continue to prosper in their mission."

No organization can successfully operate under a revolving door of short-term leaders, especially not one tasked with caring for America's heroes. Unfortunately, this is what is happening at our Nation's VA centers.  Almost 20 VA medical centers, nationwide, currently lack a permanent director. Some of these facilities have not been staffed by a permanent director in almost 2 years. Instead, these facilities are managed by short-term directors who stay on the job for just a few months.  There is just not a lot you can do in a few months. It is not nearly long enough to review operations, recommend improvements, and see these reforms brought through to an end. That is why I introduced bipartisan legislation with Mr. Costa from California that put an end to this revolving door. Our bill pushes the VA to hire permanent directors at all VA medical centers--no more interim directors.  We all want a VA system that can complete its mission to care for those who shall have borne the battle. Having consistent leadership is the least we can do for our Nation's heroes."

If you are a law-abiding gun owner, a sportsman, you need to pay attention.  This week, the House Democrats will bring a bill to the floor that will restrict your freedoms and do little to reduce gun violence.  As a father and a grandfather, I want to reduce gun violence as much as anyone, but we have to be smart. We can't get roped into scoring political points. That is why I worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle last year on a measure which is now law to increase security for our kids in the schools. But the gun control bill being considered this week makes it harder for law-abiding citizens to defend themselves and others against criminals who have guns.  We need to enforce the laws already on the books, not limit the rights of law-abiding citizens who want to protect their families."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise to urge that we come together today to defend the Constitution of the United States by repudiating President Trump's emergency declaration of February 15.  Few provisions of the Constitution are more plain than Article I, Section 9, Clause 7: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''  The President has immense powers, but he cannot spend money unless we, the people's Representatives in Congress, have agreed that he can.  Now, there might be extraordinary circumstances when a President could violate that principle, when all of us would agree that he must act but there is no time to ask Congress for funds: a military invasion or a massive natural disaster, for example. The National Emergencies Act provides for that.  But if the situation on the southern border were that kind of emergency, then the President hasn't been acting like it. For 2 years, when his party controlled the House and Senate, he never asked us for money to build a wall, and if we truly faced that kind of imminent threat, a wall would not even be an emergency measure given how long it would take to build.  The critical point is this: When the President finally got around to asking us for money, we deliberated on his request, and we said no. You may believe we were right or you may believe we were wrong, but that is what the elected Representatives of the American people decided.  So the question before us today is not how do we secure the border; it is whether this President or any President can use emergency powers to defy the Congress when he disagrees with a decision that we have made. Are we going to stand by and watch this President seize funds from the military to forcibly take land from law-abiding American citizens to build something that Congress has said should not be built?  We know this would be wrong. The National Emergencies Act is for genuine emergencies. It is not a get-out-of-the-Constitution-free card for Presidents who want something that Congress won't give them.  Now, I have heard some people say that President Obama did the same thing. I am sorry, he did not. Both President Obama and President Bush were sometimes accused of exceeding their constitutional authority; the courts sometimes overruled them. But neither Obama nor Bush nor Nixon nor Reagan nor Roosevelt nor Lincoln nor any President since the founding of our Republic has ever decreed an emergency to spend money that the Congress explicitly denied them.  If you want to find a precedent for what President Trump has done, I can give you one. When I was a diplomat representing our country and standing up for our values around the world, I had this exact same debate with authoritarian governments in Ethiopia, in Bahrain, and in Egypt, telling them: Do not use emergency powers to get around your constitutions. I never thought I would have that kind of argument with a President of the United States.  Many of my Republican colleagues have been saying that America must not go the way of Venezuela, and they are right. When President Trump said in his State of the Union that we must never become a socialist country, I joined them in getting to my feet and applauding.  But how do you think Venezuela got to be a socialist country? I will tell you. President Maduro declared a state of economic emergency to give himself the power to defy his elected national assembly and spend money however he pleased.  That is not America. We must never become that. We believe in rule of law, not rule by decree.  We disagree passionately within the boundaries the Constitution draws, but we agree zealously to defend those boundaries when any one of our party or any party tries to cross those boundaries. That is how we have survived as a constitutional democracy. It is the only way we can survive.  We are divided enough right now, so, please, let's not allow another tear in the constitutional fabric that holds us together. Let's unite as patriots on this one question so that we can safely disagree as partisans on everything else."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue that is facing Americans across the Nation: the opioids crisis.  The 2018 National Drug Threat Assessment, a comprehensive guide published by the Drug Enforcement Administration, indicates that illegal drug use continues to rise. It cites Mexican transnational criminal organizations as America's greatest enemy in the war against drugs. While these criminal organizations are bringing a wide variety of illegal drugs across our southern border, I am particularly worried about their role in spreading the opioid crisis.  Thousands of pounds of opioids are smuggled across our southern border every year. Just last year, the DEA seized more than 17,000 pounds of heroin in the United States. About 39 percent of this was seized at the southern border.  Another opioid that has devastated communities across America is fentanyl. As we started to understand the scope of the opioid crisis facing our Nation, the CDC says doctors started prescribing less and less pharmaceutical fentanyl. But fentanyl overdoses remained steady as prescription rates dropped, meaning that illicitly manufactured fentanyl is one of the main drivers of the opioid crisis.  Illicit fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is produced in China and Mexico. It is either smuggled into the United States through the mail from China or across our southern border from Mexico. In 2017, Customs and Border Patrol agents seized nearly 1,500 pounds of fentanyl at the border. Considering fentanyl is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, last year's seizures accounted for millions of potential overdoses and deaths.  But it is easy to discuss the amount of illegal drugs that have been seized at the border. It is easy to discuss the need for change. The hardest part is discussing the human toll that this crisis has taken.  Madam Speaker, last year more Americans died of a drug overdose than in any other recorded year. In 2017, overdoses killed more than 70,000 Americans, and more than 28,000 of these deaths were related to synthetic opioids such as fentanyl.  Our country is facing a crisis, and action is necessary. That is why I was proud to stand with President Trump and support H.J. Res. 31. This appropriations bill included provisions that are vital to my congressional district and that will bring the fight against opioids to the front lines: the southern border.  Although I was disappointed that my Democratic colleagues didn't include more to combat this crisis, I was pleased that it included funding for 55 miles of wall on the southern border. Walls work, and we need to continue the construction of this wall. This is why President Trump's national emergency declaration is necessary.  But, Madam Speaker, tomorrow House Democrats will bring up a measure to block President Trump's emergency declaration, H.J. Res. 46. They say the wall is immoral. They say it is cruel. I say we need decisive action to fight the opioid crisis, and this is the first step in the right direction.  Since President Carter, there have been 31 national emergencies declared. President Clinton declared 6, and President Obama declared 10 that are still in place. All 31 national emergencies recognized a dire threat to the American people and took action. By declaring this national emergency, President Trump is taking action against a threat that killed 70,000 Americans in 2017 alone.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.J. Res. 46. Support our President and save American lives."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the resolution the House will vote on later today that would terminate the President's declaration of a national emergency.  The need to secure our borders isn't just a matter of good public policy, it is our highest calling, and it is our constitutionally prescribed duty as guardians of our citizens' safety.  When our Founding Fathers penned our Constitution and changed the course of history, they charged the Federal Government in the preamble with the preeminent responsibility to provide for the common defense. But they didn't just stop there. They went on and not only empowered, but they commanded that the Federal Government shall protect every State in the Union against invasion.  Madam Speaker, unfortunately, as the American people and, especially, the citizens of the great State of Texas know far too well, the Federal Government has abdicated its most important responsibility and has been derelict in its constitutional duty to defend our borders and provide for our defense.  For too long, politicians have pontificated and they have postured that they would stop illegal immigration and that they would secure the border, but the fact is they haven't. Anyone who has been to the border or worked along the border or lives along the border knows that this is a crisis. This is a national emergency.  We know that, just last month, apprehensions at the southern border spiked 84 percent compared to the same time last year, with 120,000 apprehensions in the last 2 months alone. Homeland Security personnel spent 28,000 man-hours to render basic medical services to folks who were coming across the border.  New migrant caravans continue to form and march toward our cities along the border where our Border Patrol agents are already overwhelmed with migrants from other caravans. And in the first caravan of 8,000 people that forced their way into Mexico--they forced their way into Mexico--where they should have stopped as the first safe country when they were applying for asylum, we know that 600 of that first caravan of 8,000 were known criminals.  Additionally, because of our porous borders, drugs continue to flood into our country, poison our communities, and destroy our families.  Just last year 70,000 people died from drug overdoses in this country. Ninety percent of those drugs are coming from across the southern border. If that is not an emergency, I don't know what is.  No one is on the front lines of this fight more than the State of Texas. Since 2011, 186,000 illegal aliens have been charged with more than 290,000 crimes in Texas alone.  When you combine the total cost of illegal immigration from healthcare services, education, and incarceration, it is over $12 billion for the State of Texas. It is over $150 billion for the United States.  We are $22 trillion in debt. We will have two of our biggest safety-net programs insolvent in less than 20 years, and we are spending $150 billion on illegal immigration.  We know that constructing physical barriers, when combined with boots on the ground and technology, are effective at stemming the tide of illegal immigration.  We know walls work because we have seen it when we have deployed them in El Paso, San Diego, and Tucson, and we have stopped illegal immigration or stemmed the tide 90-plus percent.  So, instead of letting this crisis continue to worsen, this President took action, using authority not that he invented but that we in Congress explicitly gave him under the National Emergency Act.  It is not like the President is setting new precedent or breaking new ground. Other presidents have declared national emergencies 50-plus times, and I know President Clinton declared it a national emergency to fight drug traffickers--rightfully so--and President Obama against transnational criminal organizations.  This President loves this country. He wants to do his job. He doesn't want another one of our sons and daughters to die of drug addiction or overdose. He doesn't want crime to run rampant in the streets of the United States.  The President understands his first job as Commander in Chief is to keep our citizens--our people--safe, and I stand with him.  Madam Speaker, today I will be voting for our President, for his constitutional, legal authority to defend this country, to protect our borders and our citizens. I will be voting for the safety of the American people today and the safety of our communities, not just in west Texas but throughout this country.  Again, President Trump is doing the right thing. He is doing the responsible thing. He is doing the constitutionally necessary thing. And I am behind him 100 percent."

Mathew Hall Lumber has been a fixture in the community and a backbone of the local economy.  Maintaining a business is not an easy task. It involves blood, sweat, and tears to sustain the test of time. However, with that comes joy and fulfillment, something that generation after generation of the Hall family knows all about.  One of the reasons why St. Cloud and the great State of Minnesota are so incredible is because of hardworking people like the Hall family. By maintaining their business in St. Cloud, they brought commerce, jobs, and a great product to our community.  As Simonson Lumber purchases this historic company and the Hall family transitions into a new chapter, I speak for all of central Minnesota when I say thank you to the Hall family for your great contribution to our State and our community. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Sherburne County Administrator Steve Taylor.  As Steve prepares to retire from his 30-year career, he leaves with the reputation for providing the highest level of customer service.  During his time with Sherburne County and Carver County before that, Steve has served Minnesota's Sixth District with distinction.  As a fellow public servant, I commend Steve for committing his life's work to serving others. His dedication and leadership will be hard to replace.  The employees who had the pleasure of working with and learning from Steve will keep the good work going, but, certainly, his dependable presence will be missed.  His efforts toward expanding Sherburne County's government center by adding extra courtrooms, more security, and much-needed space will be enjoyed by generations to come.  Thank you, Steve, and congratulations on an amazing career in public service. I wish you a long and happy retirement. Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of Steve Gilmer, who has retired after serving 45 years as the CEO of the State Bank of Delano, Minnesota.  Steve retired leaving an incredible legacy. He cultivated a family out of his employees and built an environment based on humor, trust, and excellence, inspiring all those around him to be the best they could possibly be.  As a resident of Delano, I can say from experience that Steve led by example and took the time to know and care for the customers who walked through the door of his bank.  Most in the community knew Steve through his role as a volunteer, the volunteer treasurer of the Fourth of July Celebration Committee for over 40 years.  Delano is home to Minnesota's largest Fourth of July parade, and Steve's service to that committee displayed his dedication to our community.  Thank you for all you have done for the Delano community, Steve. Enjoy your retirement with your family and friends. You deserve it. Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the Minnesota Central Region Small Business Development Center for being named the Minnesota Small Business Development Center of Excellence.  Located at St. Cloud State University, the Central Small Business Development Center provides free consulting services and assistance to those starting a small business.  The center services the majority of my district, counties such as Benton, Sherburne, Stearns, and Wright. My constituents have benefited greatly from the services provided and the numerous business workshops focusing on educating local businesses and entrepreneurs on how to improve their new business.  Special recognition goes to the current director, Barry Kirchoff, who came to the center in 2006 with an extensive background in business and economic development.  Today, their success continues because of Barry's commitment to helping address the needs of the local small business community. His hard work is evident.  Congratulations and thank you to Barry and the staff of the Minnesota Central Region Small Business Development Center. Central Minnesota is lucky to have you. Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the achievements of the Waconia HERO Coalition. ``HERO'' stands for their mission, which is to ``Help, Empower, and Respect Others.''  This community task force based in my district undertook the mission in 2010 to reduce and prevent the use of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs by youth through education, engagement, and policy change.  What started as a group of parents, educators, and community leaders joining forces to address bullying in schools quickly became a task force tackling substance abuse.  In 2014, the Waconia HERO Coalition was awarded the Drug Free Community Support Grant, providing $625,000 of funding over 5 years. Today I want to congratulate them for receiving a continuation to that grant, which reaffirms the incredible work this task force has already done and will be doing and serves as encouragement to keep working towards solutions to youth substance abuse."

The record has to always reflect the truth, and there is a truth that is being obscured.  I want to set the record straight because there seems to be a belief that, if you have committed acts of bigotry, if you have been a racist, if you have been engaged in homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia, there seems to be a belief that, if you can do one thing, somehow that thing will eradicate and eliminate all of the bigotry that you have perpetrated.  I rise to correct the record because I want the record to show that at least one person came to the floor of this Congress and made it clear that, yes, unemployment may be low for African Americans--yes, it may be low--but it is still twice that of Anglo Americans, generally speaking.  Yes, you may have signed a bill to deal with some aspects of criminal justice in a just way, and that is appreciated. But there is still more work to be done. But notwithstanding the fact that there is more work to be done, it is still appreciated.  But the record has to be set straight, and here is what the record should show: that that does not eliminate the bigotry emanating from the Presidency.  Eliminating bigotry does not occur because you signed one bill. It does not occur because unemployment is low. It does not occur.  If you want to have the record reflect that you have done something to atone for your bigotry, then you have to do something a little bit more than to simply sign a bill.  And I am not saying to you that an apology is in order. I say to people: Tell the truth. Just tell the truth.  Say: I was wrong when I instituted a policy that separated babies from their mothers that emanates the type of bigotry that we don't condone in this country.  Say: I was wrong when I said there were some good people among those who were the racists, the bigots, the xenophobes and homophobes in Charlottesville.  Say: I was wrong when I said that you don't have to be so kind when you are taking persons into your care, custody, and control and you are part of the constabulary, you are part of the policing force in this country.  Just say you were wrong if you want to atone. Signing bills won't do it. Going to church won't do it.  Asking forgiveness will cause you to be forgiven. And I will forgive you, but that doesn't mean that you are no longer going to be sanctioned for your bigotry.  I want to thank those who have stood and made their points clear as it relates to bigotry.  I am listening to these morning programs now. They are all talking about bigotry emanating from the Presidency, not necessarily in those words. They are talking about the racism that the President perpetrates.  I appreciate what they are saying, but we have got to do more than talk about it. We cannot allow a President to remain in office who has engaged in this kind of bigoted conduct.  It is time for us to take a stand here on the floor of the House of Representatives.  There were no fine people in Charlottesville. You ought not separate babies from their mothers. You ought not have policies that would condone bigotry and encourage others to engage in it.  I believe that we have a duty to take a vote, and at some point in the near future we will take another vote, notwithstanding the Mueller report."

Welcoming the Stranger has provided countless opportunities for immigrants in southeastern Pennsylvania from over 100 countries.

Her closest competitor, whom she trailed by $400 going into Final Jeopardy, incorrectly guessed Whitney Houston, putting Meghan over the top.

It is a major feat to be selected to participate on this famous show to begin with, but to win against other highly intelligent competitors is something truly noteworthy.

Madam Speaker, S. 47 has some positive things in it. The legislation provides for expanded recreational opportunities, expanded opportunities to hunt and fish on our public lands, and a lot of things that I very much support.  Madam Speaker, the bill has some pretty profound flaws, one of which being process. This is a 700-page bill--a 700-page bill--that has been held at the desk. It has not gone through the regular committee process.  This isn't some small bill that folks have been exposed to. This is 700 pages of text, and it has not gone through the regular legislative process and, in fact, is being put up under suspension of the rules, where we are not even being provided the opportunity to offer amendments or to represent our constituents, other than just voting ``yes'' or ``no.''  Madam Speaker, I want to throw out some statistics on what this bill does and the implications. It provides 1.3 million acres of land being designated as wilderness areas--1.3 million acres; 694 acres of recreation and conservation areas; 370,000 acres of mineral withdrawals; national monument designations of 2,500 acres; 621 miles of wild and scenic rivers; 2,600 miles added to the national trail system; and 42,000 acres added to our national parks.  Now, Madam Speaker, I used to teach outdoor wilderness courses. I have spent hundreds, maybe even thousands of nights of my life in the outdoors, sleeping out in the wilderness areas, national parks, and national forests and others. I love these areas. I enjoy them.  I am not saying that these things shouldn't happen. I am saying that we need to have the ability to go through regular order, just like the Senate did this week when they had the ability to offer amendments to this bill. We are not being afforded that same opportunity.  Madam Speaker, my biggest problem or concern with this legislation is this: The bill permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which, I will say it again: I support the acquisition of lands, the protection of lands, so we can enjoy the ecological productivity and enjoy time in the great outdoors. However, the bill does not address the fact that we have a $17 billion backlog in national park maintenance--$17 billion. So we are acquiring more land without a plan for addressing the existing backlog maintenance issues that actually prohibit or prevent people from enjoying some of these same lands that are being acquired.  We are talking about the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and $9 billion in funds over the next 10 years being deposited into a Treasury receipt account to acquire more land. Guess where this money is coming from, Madam Speaker. A hundred percent of these funds is coming from the State that I represent and the other five States that produce offshore energy. Every penny of it is coming from the State of Louisiana, which produces perhaps over 80 percent of all the offshore energy of this Nation in Federal waters. It is paying for this fund.  At the same time, we have lost 2,000 square miles--2,000 square miles--of our coast. Guess how much of this bill addresses the problem there? With 2,000 square miles of our coast disappearing, the ecological productivity being lost, the increased vulnerability to the people that I represent, zero, nothing. This bill diverts money for conservation and for protection in other States in other areas and does nothing for my home State of Louisiana, yet it is coming from our revenues that we are producing in our offshore.  This is a flawed process. This is a flawed bill. We need to go through regular order.  I really can't even believe that this is happening. Here we have dozens of hearings on climate change and other things, and the very State that is the canary in the coal mine, the State that is experiencing the worst ecological challenges or losses as a result of sea rise and other challenges, is being completely ignored.  Where are the climate change advocates right now? Where are you?  I strongly urge opposition to this bill. We need to go back through regular order, consider the largest conservation and the largest natural resources bill that we have had since I have been in the Congress, and send it through regular order again.  I urge opposition to this bill."

Most Americans are unaware that the Americans who live in their Nation's Capital have the fewest rights of any Americans. That is at the same time that those 700,000 residents who live in the Nation's Capital pay the highest taxes per capita, higher than the taxes of the residents of any State.

There are many reasons that no Americans should fail to have equal rights if they pay equal taxes. But surely, service in every war the Nation has fought, even beyond being first per capita in Federal income taxes, should qualify the 700,000 residents of the District of Columbia for equal treatment as the 51st State.

Shaw, founder and pastor of Shekinah Glory Cathedral located in Plant City, Florida, and who most gracefully offered this morning's opening prayer. He is also my brother and my friend.  Pastor Shaw's dedication to family, friends, and community serves as an example to many. His over 15 years of hard work in the ministry without expecting anything in return embodies the definition of unity and the best of the human spirit.  As I listened to his prayer, I thought of the many distinguished men and women who have stood in this Chamber, at that podium, preaching the importance of unity in our great Nation.  One such man was Abraham Lincoln, who said: ``A house divided against itself cannot stand.''  In our fast-moving society, it is easy to focus on those things that divide us over those things that bring us together. It is why, Mr. Speaker, I stand here today calling for greater unity among all who serve in this Chamber, among the American people and for the thousands of communities across our great land.  Only together can we withstand adversity, not just as individuals, but as a Nation. This does not mean that we will always agree. It does mean we should seek unity in those disagreements.  We do not need to see eye to eye to walk hand in hand.  If, as a Nation, we seek to remain strong into the 21st century, we must stand united through our differences."

This week we have the opportunity to vote on two pieces of legislation that close loopholes in the gun purchase background check process.  These aren't radical or partisan policies. Background checks are supported by 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners.

So, when communities face a known public risk, new or recently reclassified, we rightly expect the EPA to act--quickly, comprehensively, and transparently.  In the Chicago area, this, sadly, has not been the case. Ethylene oxide, or EtO, was reclassified as a known carcinogen more than 2 years ago, yet we just recently learned facilities around Chicago could be emitting it at elevated levels.  The EPA has been unacceptably slow to respond and has failed to keep affected communities informed.  This month, I partnered with Senators Durbin and Duckworth and other colleagues in my delegation to introduce legislation that would require the EPA to immediately revise and update its EtO standards and to keep the public fully informed.  We are also demanding that EPA evaluate ambient levels of EtO in these communities immediately, something it should be doing already.  Our communities deserve more from the EPA.

But what thousands of these 9/11 heroes and their families now face is being forgotten because the Victims Compensation Fund, which supports these families and these heroes in all 50 States, is running out of money and cutting benefits by 50 to 70 percent.  That is wrong. And if we fail to make this right, shame on us.

Mr. Speaker, 3-year-old Kannon is one of 4 percent of children in the United States who is born with a congenital anomaly--in his case, hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia.  Most health plans provide coverage for congenital anomalies, and many States require insurers to provide coverage of any health services related to congenital anomalies.  Despite this, health plans systematically and routinely deny claims and appeals for any oral or dental related procedures under the pretense that such service is merely cosmetic.  That is why Representative Collin Peterson and I have joined together to introduce the Ensuring Lasting Smiles Act, a bipartisan bill that would directly address this issue and ensure that we don't have to tell children like Kannon that their health condition isn't valued by insurance companies.  As the original sponsor on the Republican side, I am proud to put my name on this bill and ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.  ELSA would ensure all health plans cover medically necessary services, including reconstructive surgeries that are a result of congenital anomalies or birth defects.  If enacted, this life-changing bill will allow the Koser family the opportunity to save for Kannon's college rather than spend money on reconstructive surgery.  Commonsense reforms like this will help children like Kannon grow up healthier and have a better quality of life.  Hi, Kannon. We will see you later, Buddy."

After Congress repeatedly rejected his phony border crisis and wasteful wall, Trump decided: build it anyway.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 144, providing for consideration of H.J. Res. 46, relating to a national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019.  The rule provides for consideration of the legislation under a closed rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.  Additionally, the rule provides that the provisions of section 202 of the National Emergencies Act shall not apply during the remainder of the 116th Congress to a joint resolution terminating the national emergency declared by the President on February 15, 2019. This provision was included to avoid privileged legislative action on redundant resolutions.  Mr. Speaker, today we must stand up for democracy; we must stand up for the rule of law; and, most importantly, we must stand up for the United States Constitution, the Constitution that we took an oath to defend when we were sworn into office.  Mr. Speaker, the Constitution we swore to defend granted Congress the power of the purse. That means Congress decides how we spend the American people's hard-earned money.  Congress spoke when we passed, and President Trump signed, a spending bill that granted him $1.4 billion for fencing along the border. Now President Trump is acting like a dictator by ignoring Congress and declaring a national emergency. As a result, billions of taxpayer dollars would be taken from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness, and quality of life necessary to keep the American people safe.  Mr. Speaker, as a former member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I have visited countries where the rule of law takes a backseat to the whims of their Presidents. Just look at Venezuela, where Nicolas Maduro has removed every single obstacle to his power.  When he objected to the rulings of the judges, he ended their terms early and replaced them with his political allies. When the democratically elected congress didn't agree with him, he created a new congress filled with his supporters.  Last year, he even banned prominent opposition leaders from running into the Presidential election. He has demonized the press and even took CNN en Espanol off the air. Last night, he detained one of America's journalists, Jorge Ramos, of Univision.  Fighting with judges, manipulating elections, attacking the press. Mr. Speaker, does any of this sound familiar?  Now you have a situation where food is so scarce that the average Venezuelan has lost 24 pounds in the last year and more than 3 million have fled the country. The Maduro presidency, now that is a true national emergency for the people of Venezuela. The collapse of democratic institutions is also happening in Nicaragua and Guatemala. The President of Guatemala and his allies in congress are taking the country down the same path, removing every check on their power. They have expelled the international prosecutors who dared to investigate them.  And just as Guatemala's Government has tried to undermine and delegitimize the police and prosecutors who are investigating, President Trump has called Robert Mueller's investigation a ``witch hunt'' and denigrated the brave men and women of the FBI.  Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow this President--or any President, Republican or Democrat--to take us down the same path as Venezuela, Guatemala, and Nicaragua, all to build a wasteful and ineffective wall along our southern border.  These women and children coming from Central America do not represent a national emergency. That is why 58 former national security officials, both Republicans and Democrats, issued a statement saying there is ``no factual basis'' for the President's emergency.  Our call to duty today is to protect, to defend our Constitution. We will vote, and we will see how many in this body have that same respect for the rule of law. Mr. Speaker, I urge our Republican colleagues to join us in this effort. It is not too late for my colleagues across the aisle to tell the President that this is wrong, that the Constitution that we swore an oath to uphold really matters.  We stand here today to stop this power grab of our own democracy. A ``yes'' vote will affirm our democracy. A ``no'' vote further erodes the trust in our democracy and, again, expands executive power.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues on which side they stand.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, I want you to know it flatters both me and the gentlewoman from California that you have made it your habit to be down here during Rules Committee time. It is good to know that you respect what we do upstairs as much as the members of the committee do.  I always enjoy coming down for the Rules Committee debate, because it is the only debate on all of Capitol Hill where the Reading Clerk reads every single word of the bill that we are about to consider. Ordinarily, we waive that, but the rules don't let you waive it. You have to read the rule so folks will understand what is happening today.  I happened to time the Reading Clerk today. I didn't put him up to anything special. He read as he always does. It took him 1 minute and 6 seconds to read the resolution that is before us.  I heard my friend from California talk about the important constitutional questions that are here before us today. I heard my friend from California equate our President to discredited despots around the globe and how we must stand up to prevent that behavior here in America. I heard my colleagues who took to the floor this morning for 1 minutes be sanctioned by the Chair and advised to cease engaging in arguments of personality and attacks against our President.  One minute and 6 seconds it took to read the resolution before us today, Mr. Speaker, and that is 1 minute and 6 seconds longer than this resolution has been considered in total in every committee throughout this Capitol.  I want to say that again. You heard my colleague talk about how critically important this resolution of disapproval is as it relates to our constitutional powers. You heard it described as a power grab equivalent to those of discredited despots. And we haven't talked about it at all in this Chamber. In committees, not one witness has testified.  One minute and 6 seconds is how much we have invested in these nationally important matters.  I listened, Mr. Speaker, as you cautioned Member after Member to cease engaging in personal attacks on the President during their 1 minutes this morning. Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that that is exactly what we are doing here today.  If you want to have a debate about Article I and Article II powers and how we ought to retrieve the power that has slid down Pennsylvania Avenue through administration after administration after administration, I am not just your willing partner, I am your enthusiastic partner and passionate advocate. But that is not the bill we have before us today. It is not the debate we are going to have today.  This is another in a long string of measures that have been brought to the floor of this House that could have been brought in a bipartisan way. I don't mean one Republican; I don't mean two Republicans; I mean the majority of Democrats and the majority of Republicans standing together to speak with one voice on behalf of the American people. But time and time again, we are missing that opportunity.  This isn't a constitutional issue today, Mr. Speaker, though you would not know that, because we have not had any witnesses testify. This is a legislative issue before us today.  There is, in fact, a National Emergencies Act that allows the President to do extraordinary things if he or she decides there is a national emergency. That is not unconstitutional. Congress passed the National Emergencies Act; the President signed the National Emergencies Act. Perhaps the Supreme Court one day will decide that was an unconstitutional delegation of power by the Congress, but the Congress delegated that power in the National Emergencies Act.  The way we talk about this issue, Mr. Speaker, you would think this is the first time you and I have seen this in the few years we have been in Congress. Of course, you and I know that is nonsense.  There are 31 other national emergency declarations in effect today--31 other national emergency declarations. National emergency declarations from the Obama administration are still active today.  If we are so concerned about Article I and Article II power grabs, perhaps these emergency declarations that have been on the books since the last administration, Congress should deal with those affirmatively here on the floor.  There are national emergency declarations still in effect from the Bush administration. There are national emergencies still in effect from the Clinton administration. Mr. Speaker, there are national emergencies still in effect from the Carter administration. This House has made not a single effort to draw back that power from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.  Those are legitimate questions. Those are important questions. Those are things that bring us together as the people's representatives in this House, not bills designed just to poke a stick at a President who has real passion and real conviction about issues of real importance.  Do you know what is in this resolution today, Mr. Speaker, what is in this disapproval resolution today, that will make a difference on the border in terms of ending human trafficking? Not one thing.  Do you know what is in this resolution today that, if we come together to pass, will make a difference in terms of drug trafficking on the border? Not one thing.  What about if we come together to pass this resolution today for the very serious issue of weapons trafficking across our border? Do you know what we will do today to fix that? Not one thing.  Victims of sexual assault as they are being trafficked into this country, do you know what we are going to do to fix that today? Not one thing.  Do you know how many Dreamers are going to have their hopes realized today with a pathway to permanency here in the United States of America? Not one.  Man, we are good at bringing issues that are designed to poke each other in the eye. We are so good at bringing issues designed to try to embarrass one and boost another. But I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, we are not so great with actually solving real problems.  For the first time in my congressional career just last Congress, Mr. Speaker, we brought a bill to the floor that would have provided permanency for our Dreamers and that would have provided solutions on our border for human trafficking, for weapons trafficking, and for drug trafficking. You know how many Democratic votes we got on that bill, Mr. Speaker? Not one.  Now, to be fair, it wasn't one bill; it was two bills. Folks said, hey, if this one is not the right one, let's bring another one. Maybe this is going to bring people together.  Do you know how many votes we got on the second bill, Mr. Speaker, from the other side of the aisle? Not one. The only bills that have come to the floor to provide a pathway for Dreamers in my 8 years in Congress, and we got not one vote from the other side the aisle.  Is that because the other side of the aisle doesn't believe in those solutions? No, that is not why. It is because the other side of the aisle, in its wisdom, deemed that to be a resolution not designed to support the Dreamers, but designed to divide. I disagree with that conclusion, but that is the conclusion that was made. Thus, the only opportunity in a decade we have had to support Dreamers, not one Democrat stood up and said yes.  I call that a failed opportunity, and I am not interested in figuring out who is to blame for that failed opportunity.  This is a failed opportunity today, too, Mr. Speaker. Sadly, it is another in a series of failed opportunities here in 2019.  I believe my colleagues are going to see through the divisiveness of this resolution, through the charade of constitutionalism right down to the very core of partisanism that underlies this resolution.  But just remember, 1 minute and 6 seconds, Mr. Speaker. Before I took to the microphone today, 1 minute and 6 seconds from the Reading Clerk is all the time this new Congress has dedicated to an issue that you are going to hear from my colleagues again and again is one of critical national importance, international importance, constitutional importance. How can those things be true?  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  Mrs. TORRES of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I can think of many other things that we could be talking about that truly, truly, truly call out and scream out for a national emergency.  Homelessness in our communities: Thousands of people in our communities sleep on a street, under a bridge, children sleeping in vehicles every single night.  I think about the opioid epidemic, and how many of our families are simply immune to the issues around drug abuse and how addiction overcomes them?  I think about last year around Christmastime when 800,000 of our Federal workers were going without a paycheck and went without a paycheck for 35 days. Yet my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could not find 1 minute and 6 seconds to give them a paycheck, to open up the Federal Government, to do their duty.  Instead, in the Rules Committee, we took up an emergency order on labeling of cheese curds. They found that to be more important than the lives and the families of 800,000 Federal workers.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee)."

It might be that if there was a pending war on the southern border, one might determine that that is the case.  It might be that, in 2001, the first sense of terrorism came when an individual crossed the northern border to attack the United States. If that had continued with throngs of terrorists coming across the northern border, the President then might have declared a national emergency.  But we do not have that, Mr. Speaker. What we have is a person's desire.  We understand that the apprehensions at the southern border have actually gone down. The combined 521,000 apprehensions for border and Customs agents for fiscal year 2018 was 32,288 apprehensions fewer.  Those who are coming across the border in the last 6 to 8 months are coming across as mothers and children fleeing the catastrophe of bloodshed in Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. These are people desperate for help. They are coming through legal ports of entry.  How do I know that? I have stood and watched them come. I have spoken to a mother whose baby was 45 days old. She had birthed on her road here, not because she just wanted a vacation, but because they had committed to decapitating her if she did not leave town immediately, meaning leave one of the countries. It was my plea that got her to be able to go to a hospital. I held little Roger in my hands, who is 9 months old. He had been separated at the border from his family.  These are the issues that are being addressed at the border. There is no catastrophe.  Let me be very clear, as my friends always cite illegal immigration, I want to make sure that any criminal, no matter who they are, who does any injury to anyone in the United States, count me as standing on the side of bringing that person to justice. But that is not what is happening at the border. Therefore, I would ask the administration to attend themselves to the Constitution, to recognize the difficulty or the wrongness of distorting the purposes of the United States Congress, the House, that has the purse strings by calling it a national emergency. My God, if we were to have one, would this Nation even understand how to implement it because they are hearing it being declared in a very foolish way?  I conclude by simply saying that 58 people in national security, Mr. Speaker--58 of them--have indicated this is wrongheaded and jeopardizes our national security.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for the resolution that I have cosponsored, H.J. Res. 46."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, in fiscal year 2018, more than 2,000 illegal aliens were apprehended by Federal agents for homicides committed on American soil. Worse yet, roughly 31,000 Americans die each year from heroin and cocaine overdoses, 90 percent of which floods across America's porous southern border. Hence, we can expect at least 33,000 dead Americans each year until America secures our porous southern border.  For perspective, the 9/11 terrorist attacks killed roughly 3,000 people. In response, America invaded Iraq and Afghanistan at a cost of trillions of dollars and, roughly, 7,000 lost military personnel lives.  Saving Americans should be a bipartisan issue, yet here we are. Republicans seek to prevent another 33,000 dead Americans this year, while partisan Democrats seek to embarrass and stop President Trump from securing America's porous southern border and saving American lives.  For emphasis, no national emergency in history has been prompted by more dead Americans than President Trump's national emergency declaration. As such, I support President Trump's national emergency declaration and will vote accordingly.  Mr. Speaker, how many dead Americans does it take for open border advocates to support border security? How much American blood must be on guilty hands before Congress recognizes the national emergency we face at America's southern border? America's military protects the borders of, and lives in, South Korea, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, many other countries, and Europe. I thank President Trump, as Commander in Chief, for understanding that America, and Americans, deserve no less protection.  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by noting that dead Americans, Americans killed by illegal aliens as a consequence of porous borders, had dreams, too. We, as a Congress, should remember and honor those dreams and act accordingly and protect this national emergency to protect American lives by securing our porous southern border."

For Central America, we are standing up for our responsibility to uphold democracy in the Northern Triangle, to address the root cause of migration. That is where our focus should be.

What we are doing here, what the President has chosen to do, is political theater, political theater for 2020.

Mr. Speaker, I came to the floor to urge Members to vote against this ill-advised resolution to disallow the President's declaration for emergency funding on the border.  In 2006, I was in Congress, and Congress voted for the Secure Fence Act. With the Secure Fence Act, under President Bush, 400 miles of border fence was built. Under President Obama, an additional little over 100 miles was built. Now President Trump has asked for a little over 200 miles to be built to provide security for America.  Now, is it a national emergency? I will tell you, I had as my guest to the State of the Union someone who is referred to as an angel dad. This is an individual who went and put on the uniform and fought for his country in Iraq. While he was there, unfortunately, his wife got ill and died, and he came home. Now he is a single dad, and he is taking care of his only child, a daughter. That daughter, unfortunately, was hit by a car on the street that was driven by someone who did not have legal status to be in this country.  Several months later, Chris came to me and said: Congressman, I did my job. I put on the uniform. I went and defended my country. Mr. Congressman, I did my job, and if you had been doing yours, my daughter would be here today.  President Trump has taken that mantle very seriously. It is his goal, it is his requirement, to defend our country at the southern border, and the President will do just that.  If you read the history of emergency declarations in the past, you will find a number of them. Some, perhaps, you might agree with; some, perhaps, you might disagree with. But since the founding of our country, it has been recognized that it has been the purview under Article II powers for the President of the United States to be able to exercise that emergency declaration. It was codified in the 1970s in a law that is now the one that brings this forward today, that brings forward this resolution of disapproval.  If you don't like the law that allows the President to declare an emergency, change the law. You are the majority. You control the Rules Committee. Change the law.  What is interesting about this is, last night, in the Rules Committee, when we considered Mr. Castro's resolution, we didn't consider it. We didn't have a single witness. Mr. Castro, I felt like sending Capitol Police out to find him. There was no one there to testify in favor of his resolution. The Rules Committee seemed perfectly agreeable to accepting this without any debate whatsoever.  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote against this ill-advised motion to disallow the President's declaration of an emergency. Allow the President to do the job he was elected to do and secure the southern border."

Mr. Speaker, if we, indeed, defeat the previous question, we will allow consideration of H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.  I introduced this legislation because the Constitution clearly states that all persons born in this country are entitled to life, liberty, and equal protection under the law. The Constitution does not put age limits on those who are entitled to life.  I am horrified, Mr. Speaker, that many in the United States Senate, many Democrats, flagrantly violated the United States Constitution last night and voted down the Born-Alive Act, embracing, in fact, infanticide.  Pro-abortion politicians used to say life begins at birth. Now it is more unclear than ever when they believe that life actually begins or whether they even believe that living and breathing human beings should be protected under the law.  I would like to commend three Democrats, in fact--Senators Bob Casey, Joe Manchin, and Doug Jones--who defended the basic rights of newborn children and voted for my legislation last evening in the United States Senate.  I introduced this legislation because it is just common sense. I am shocked that there are prominent American legislators who believe in denying babies lifesaving medical care when they are born.  As a mother, a grandmother, a legislator, and an advocate who came to Congress to serve as a voice for the voiceless, I believe that life begins at conception and that it is wrong to kill a child no matter how many weeks old he or she may be. But I am grieved to find that I now must defend something that I never thought we would have to fight for: lifesaving care for babies born alive. In response to radical legislators who are promoting not just late-term abortions but infanticide, it is essential that we come together to protect children. So today, I am here to ask--no, Mr. Speaker, I am here to implore--my colleagues to right the wrong that the Senate has committed and defeat the previous question, and at least allow the debate to support H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Act here in the people's House.  Mr. Speaker, this should not be a partisan issue. Congress must never stop fighting to ensure that every single newborn baby in the United States of America receives lifesaving care, no matter their sex or their race or ethnicity or whether or not they are wanted and cuddled and wrapped into that first warm hug that they deserve.  The Born-Alive Act is the simplest vote any of us can take: Do you support babies receiving lifesaving care after they are born, or would you deny these innocent children that care and allow them to be left to die and be discarded?  This is bipartisan legislation, Mr. Speaker. Last year, six of my Democratic colleagues joined me in voting for the Born-Alive Act.  I hope that we will bring this bill to the floor for debate so that many more of my colleagues can go on the record and vote to stand with America's mothers and children.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question."

Also, let's make one thing clear: There is no emergency at the border. The only crisis at the border is the humanitarian crisis that the President created himself through his hateful family separation policies.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. If we defeat the previous question, we will bring up the text of this important piece of legislation to defend life.  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am mystified as to why the majority is loath to actually make this vote. Indeed, they have been doing backflips to avoid allowing the House to actually go on record on this important issue.  This bill is a commonsense approach to protecting our Nation's most vulnerable. It amends the Federal Criminal Code simply to require that any doctor present when a child is born alive following an abortion or attempted abortion must provide the child with the same degree of care as he or she would provide any other child. The bill also requires that any such child is immediately admitted to a hospital.  Mr. Speaker, as we have seen in recent weeks, many people in elected positions do not appear to appreciate the need to provide for protections for our most vulnerable Americans newly born, but it is clear that current law fails to provide adequate protections for newborns who survive an abortion attempt. This bill draws a sorely needed bright line of protection around abortion survivors and requires that they be given the same level of care as any other premature infant.  As stewards of the law of this country, Mr. Speaker, protecting the most vulnerable, including the unborn, should be one of Congress' basic responsibilities.  Since entering Congress, I have made the protection of life one of my highest priorities. I believe that all Members should have that same priority. Today, we can take a step toward making this a reality by defeating the previous question and bringing up the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act for a vote.

Mr. Speaker, having visited the southern border multiple times in the past year, including just last month when I met with Customs and Border Patrol officials, I can say without any question that there is no emergency at the border.  We as a nation face serious challenges in reforming our immigration system and stemming the flow of illegal drugs into our country. However, a border wall will do nothing to address these challenges.  Research consistently shows that the vast majority of illegal drugs coming to this country through the border are smuggled through legal ports of entry, and most illegal immigration is as a result of people overstaying their visas.  All this declaration will do is divert $6.7 billion away from critical military construction projects and drug interdiction operations, hampering our Nation's military readiness and making it more difficult to address real challenges. These are funds that would be better used on projects to improve and build new military family housing or make improvements to National Guard and Reserve facilities throughout our country.  Mr. Speaker, we should not be spending a single day wasting time on this ridiculous, misguided executive order from the President. There is no emergency at the border. Illegal border crossings are at a 40-year low. The President's own intelligence community, when they did their worldwide threat assessment, testified and didn't mention the southern border--and certainly did not identify it as an emergency.  Instead of wasting time on this, we should be getting back to the work of driving down prescription drug prices, focusing on rebuilding the infrastructure of our country, and passing H.R. 1 to get government working again for the people of this country and not the special interests.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to approve the rule, vote for the resolution, and end the President's unconstitutional, excessive use of power attempting to circumvent the will of the American people.

I do believe that the President, given the years and decades of delegation of authority from Congress to the President's Office, has the authority to take the action that he is taking in regards to this proposed issue at the border.  But where I agree with my colleagues on the other side is that the Presidential authority is something that we need to take into consideration and reform going forward.  It should not be because it is President Trump; it should not be because it was President Obama; but each and every time the executive branch uses its authority and reaches into areas that go beyond the constitutional limits of that office, we should stand together as Members of Congress to assert our authority.  That is why, Mr. Speaker, there is a bipartisan group of us working over the last few weeks, and we intend to drop a resolution sometime soon, that will amend the National Emergencies Act to make it clear that, when there is a national emergency declared in this country, that we speak as one nation, one body here in Congress with the President.  We have to affirmatively take a vote here in Congress, go on record, and not hide any longer as Members of Congress. We should be held accountable by putting our voting cards in that box to stand before the American people.  When a national emergency is declared by the President, we have to vote whether or not, guaranteed vote, to see if that is something we agree with the President on. That is a fundamental reform that will reestablish Article I of the Constitution.  And to my colleagues who are up today: Where were you when President Obama overreached in his executive office?  So I ask you to remember those days and stand with us who are looking to take on the root cause of this problem and reestablish the congressional authority that rightfully is contained under the Constitution."

Mr. Speaker, you just heard an impassioned plea from my friends on the other side of the aisle about the important constitutional questions that are before us today, about how the President's emergency declaration violated those sacred constitutional principles.  Candidly, I don't know if my colleagues are right or not because we have not had one legal expert come to talk about the National Emergencies Act. Most of us were not in Congress when it passed several decades ago, but it is a delegation of authority from Congress to the executive. You just heard my friend from New York come to the well and say, listen, we have been working in a bipartisan way to offer a bill to rein in those authorities. I think that is important work. I think that is work that we ought to all be able to agree on. We should be doing that work first.  I told you earlier, Mr. Speaker, the sum total of all of the time this institution has spent working on these important constitutional questions is the 1 minute and 6 seconds our Reading Clerk Josef spent reading us the resolution today.  We will vote on this rule today. We will vote on the underlying disapproval today, having never had the committees of jurisdiction hold even a single hearing.  Now, lest you think there is just no time in the calendar, this resolution is referred to the Transportation Committee on which I sit. In fact, I had to leave a Transportation Committee hearing in order to come up here to do the rule today.  We are working on the Green New Deal in the Transportation Committee today. We are working on electric vehicles and how to reduce carbon emissions across the country. Now, I am not saying that is not important work, but I have not heard one of my colleagues talk about the dearth of electric vehicles and how that is threatening the future of our land.  I have heard my colleagues talk about this important constitutional question that this disapproval brings before us, and, yet, there was not one hearing on it.  Now, lest you think, Mr. Speaker, that if we deal with this today, we won't deal with it again. No. We are going to have some hearings on this resolution. When? Later in the week after it passes.  Now, I don't know if that is a pattern that we are going to get into. I hope that it is not. Having had no hearings and no witnesses testify on this issue, we are going to have an Appropriation Subcommittee hearing later this week to talk about exactly these issues, where the money is coming from, what the impact of that is, and whether or not it is wise.  We are going to have a hearing later this week in the Judiciary Committee talking about the National Emergencies Act, and whether or not it permits this kind of activity, and what kind of changes ought to be made.  This resolution will have already been considered. This vote will have already been taken, but we will eventually get around to having thoughtful conversation about this.  Mr. Speaker, I close where I began. There is more that unites us as Americans than divides us. And even in politics, there is more that unites this institution than divides us. Making sure that 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue only is exercising those authorities delegated to it by either the Constitution or this Congress, is a shared value.  But if you listen to the debate here on the floor, from the Speaker's chair, you had to caution our colleagues against engaging in attacks of personality against the President. We heard debate, not of thoughtful constitutional principles, but of hateful administration policies.  Mr. Speaker, I will tell my friends, I don't believe those words, those actions, or those efforts are going to bring us one bit closer to the shared values that we have in this institution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject the rule today and vote against the previous question so that we can bring up a bill that will save lives. This bill will save not one life; will prevent not one drug trafficker from coming into the country; will protect not one migrant family. It will do nothing, Mr. Speaker, to solve real problems that face this country.  If we defeat the previous question, we can at least take a commonsense step toward doing exactly that. Vote ``no'' on this rule, vote ``no'' on the previous question, and let's commit ourselves to finding a way to come together.  If you believe there is more that divides us than unites us, these first 45 days of this session have been just perfect for you. But if you believe, as I do, that we can do better, let today be the end of the partisan attacks. Let today be the end of bringing bills to the floor designed to make a point instead of make a difference, and let's make tomorrow better."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, fact-checking the President is not an attack against the President. The facts matter. As a matter of fact, the President himself at his press conference said: ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.''  What does he mean by that? Last year, Republicans gave him $25 billion if they read the bill, but I actually brought it to their attention on the floor that the bill actually read $75 billion that they were allocating for a border wall. The facts didn't matter then for one side of the aisle.  The President himself said it. ``I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.'' That is not an emergency. I was a 911 emergency dispatcher for 17.5 years. I can cite many examples of what an emergency is. Building a wall much faster is not an emergency. That is political theater. That is political posturing for 2020.  Where is the President stealing this money from? Certainly, he is not getting it from Mexico as he promised. Mexico said ``no.'' The President is stealing $2.5 billion that Congress approved to combat illegal drug activities around the world.  I know that my colleagues believe that fighting international drug organizations is important. I know this because I traveled with Republicans and Democrats to the jungles in South America. We talked about eradication of narcotrafficking.  What about the $3.6 billion that the President is stealing from military construction? A study earlier this year found that 16 percent of military families had a positive view of their base housing. That means 55 percent had a negative one.  Many families reported unsafe conditions, including lead-based paint, rampant mold, exposed asbestos, faulty electrical wiring, vermin infestations, and gas leaks. Is that not an emergency? Is that not worthy of the bipartisan vote that we took to allocate that money so that they can make those fixes?  I know my Republican colleagues support military families. I know that because I have traveled with them to Afghanistan. I have traveled with them to other countries. I know that this is wrong. This so-called national emergency is wrong, and I know my colleagues know that this is wrong too. This is undemocratic. This puts us at the cusp of a constitutional crisis.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the previous question and the rule.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency issued by the President on February 15, 2019.  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the United States.  As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I to check and balance the Executive Branch.  The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that ``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every region of the country, by every income group and education category.  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former Republican senators and Members of Congress.  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or Congress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion dollar concrete wall, the President has now embarked on a course of conduct that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served this nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate 11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the Congress of the United States.  The Congress will not tolerate this.  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false information regarding the state of our southern border.  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a slight increase from 2017.  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the 553,378 apprehensions in 2016.  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in 2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest since the 1970s.  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are smuggled through legal ports of entry.  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Secret Service.  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than 59,000 personnel.  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of 19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of National Guard to the border.  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military construction.  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national security officials including former secretaries of state, defense secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the President's emergency declaration.  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's declaration makes America less safe.  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American people safe, directly undermining America's national security.  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, violating our Founders' vision for America.  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching president.  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a resounding YES vote on H.J. Res. 46.  The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:"

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule, House Resolution 145, providing for consideration of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, and H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019.  The rule provides for consideration of each bill under a structured rule. The rule also provides 1 hour of general debate on each bill equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the Judiciary.  The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 and the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 arrived at a time of emergency for America--a real emergency. Every year 120,000 Americans are shot in our country, and 35,000 of them are shot dead. Seventeen thousand of the people wounded or killed each year are children or teenagers, their families devastated, their lives forever changed.  In 2017, gun deaths in America hit the highest level in 40 years, with 40,000 Americans killed.  We have lost more Americans to gun violence in our own communities than to the Vietnam war, the Revolutionary War, the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean war, the Iraq war, and the Afghan war, combined. This war at home never stops. Each day--yesterday, today, and tomorrow--another 100 people in America are shot and killed by gun violence.  Mr. Speaker, this is not a global problem; it is an American problem. While 35,000 Americans are killed by gunfire here each year, it is 146 people in the United Kingdom, 142 in Portugal, and 30 in Japan.  We lose more people to gun violence in a single weekend than England loses all year. We lost more people in the Las Vegas massacre alone, in one bloody night, than the nation of Japan lost to gun violence in 8 years.  No other developed, high-income country's lethal gun violence even comes close to the American carnage allowed by our loophole-ridden gun laws. The gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher than the average of other high-income countries and hundreds of times higher than some of them.  Now, the good news is that we know what to do to begin to end this crisis. We must close the loopholes.  In 1994, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act went into effect and required licensed firearm dealers to contact the FBI to run a background check through NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System.  The Brady Act made it illegal to sell a firearm to felons, to fugitives, to people who had been committed to mental institutions, to drug addicts, to domestic abusers, to undocumented immigrants, and to other disqualified categories.  The Brady Act worked as far as it went. It stopped more than 3 million illegal purchases of firearms by convicted felons, violently abusive partners, fugitives, the mentally ill, and so on. But there are gaping loopholes in the law because unlicensed gun sellers, the people who sell guns online today or at gun shows or in other private transactions, can sell firearms without having to run any background check whatsoever.  More than one-fifth of U.S. gun owners acquired their most recent firearm without any background check at all, which means that millions of people obtained millions of firearms without going through the Brady system, and people who commit gun crimes overwhelmingly obtain their firearms from the unlicensed sources. A 2013 study found that 80 percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources that were not required to go through the background check.  The criminals are not stupid. They follow the loopholes. They go to the internet. They go to the gun shows. They go to the convenience store parking lots to get their weapons of mass destruction without any background check at all.  Our legislation will close these dangerous loopholes by guaranteeing that there is a thorough NICS background check on every gun sale or transfer, with only a few carefully defined exceptions for intrafamily gifts and a few other cases.  Mr. Speaker, there are three primary things you need to know about this legislation:  First, it is backed by more than 90 percent of the American people--fully, 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners, 97 percent of Republicans, and 99 percent of Democrats. It is the very essence of common sense, the sense we all have in common, to make the background check system comprehensive and universal, leakproof, foolproof, and not ridden by the loopholes.  A background check doesn't work if criminals know that there are massive and lawful ways to cheat and get around it. So America, today, stands up to close the loopholes, and that is why this is a day of great triumph for the gun safety movement that has swept America in response to Parkland, Las Vegas, Newtown, and the other massacres that our people have endured.  Second, this legislation is perfectly constitutional. As Justice Scalia found for the Supreme Court in the District of Columbia v. Heller decision, the Second Amendment permits reasonable regulation to exclude from gun ownership violent felons, the mentally unstable, and so on.  Despite all of the solemn invocations of the Second Amendment that we continue to hear bouncing off of the walls of Congress, the opponents of this legislation could not muster a single witness to actually argue that this legislation is unconstitutional, and that includes the George Mason University Antonin Scalia School of Law professor of constitutional law and the Second Amendment who was brought in and just expressed her policy misgivings about the bill without articulating any constitutional analysis at all and rejected the opportunity to say that this legislation is unconstitutional.  The reason 97 percent of Americans favor this legislation is because it is perfectly consistent with the letter and spirit of the Second Amendment, and it sweepingly advances public safety at the same time.  Third, this bill will dramatically lower gun violence in America. More than 90 percent of Brady background checks take less than 90 seconds to complete. But these checks have literally stopped more than 3 million illegal gun purchases by felons, fugitives, domestic offenders, the violently mentally ill, undocumented aliens, and so on. Every day, background checks stop 170 felons and 50 domestic abusers from purchasing a gun. Imagine how much more effective this system will be when we close these gaping loopholes.  Yet, even in the face of the shocking death toll which distinguishes our society from the other wealthy societies on Earth, despite the overwhelming public support for this legislation, and despite its clear constitutionality, our friends across the aisle oppose closing the internet, the gun show, and the private sale loopholes.  Instead of getting on our side to close the loopholes, what do they give us? More loopholes. They brought us dozens of amendments to try to suggest more loopholes to the current law.  That is obviously not the direction that America needs to go in, and you will hear some more about that today, Mr. Speaker. They have given us a veritable loophole factory. But now is the time to close loopholes, not reproduce them.  Let's focus on the public safety, which is the cardinal purpose of law in the social contract in a democratic society. Let's pass this excellent bill, and let's pass H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, which closes the Charleston loophole, the loophole that made it possible for a guy to go out and get a gun because the dealer decided to give him a gun after 3 days because they were still doing a background check.  This loophole says that if it has taken 3 days or more, you have a right to go ahead and get your gun. We are going to close that one, the so-called default proceed provision. We are going to close that one, too, so that we don't see any repeat massacres like the one that took place in June of 2015 at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina.  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I thank Mr. Raskin for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.  Mr. Speaker, all of us, Republicans and Democrats, want to reduce gun violence. I think there is just a difference of opinion on how we get there.  Unfortunately, H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, although well-intentioned, will not reduce gun violence as Mr. Raskin said, and instead it will turn everyday, law-abiding individuals into criminals and could actually do more harm than good.  I grew up in a family that didn't have guns. After my dad returned from World War II, he stopped hunting. So, because I wasn't around them, I have to admit I had an irrational fear of guns for awhile. It wasn't until I became an adult that I got educated.  I remember I first went to a debate where the person who was talking for gun rights said: Do you know who follows the laws? Law-abiding people follow the laws. Who doesn't follow the laws? Criminals do not follow the laws.  So although well-intentioned, often laws are unenforceable, and criminals just do not follow them.  H.R. 8, again, I believe is well-intentioned. But it will not solve the problem. H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the mass shootings in the last 20 years, not one of them. I studied them because I am on the Judiciary Committee along with Mr. Raskin, and we heard this bill in that committee. In most cases, guns were obtained legally. Recent attackers have passed background checks to acquire their firearms, including the attackers at the Thousand Oaks, California, shooting; the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania shooting; the attacker in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Parkland, Florida, shooting; the shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida; and the Las Vegas, Nevada, shooting. None of these attacks would have been prevented if H.R. 8 or H.R. 1112 were law.  Then, the attackers in the Columbine High School Colorado shooting used straw purchasers for their weapons, an act that is already illegal and has been illegal since at least the 1960s.  Adam Lanza, the attacker in the Sandy Hook Elementary School, Newtown, Connecticut, shooting used his mother's firearms which were legally purchased by his mother. So as you can see--and I have each one of them listed how the attackers got their guns--H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112 would not have prevented any of these shootings.  Not only would none of the mass shootings be prevented by H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112, but the Department of Justice under President Obama said that in order for universal background checks to actually work and be enforceable, a Federal gun registry is needed. Yet this legislation in H.R. 8 specifically prohibits a registry; thus, again, it is unenforceable.  The fact is criminals don't get their guns legally and will not go through a background check to get their guns even if this bill were signed into law. A recent Department of Justice report of prison inmates that used guns in their crimes showed that 56 percent obtained their guns illegally and another 25 percent received them from family members--which, by the way, family members are still allowed to get the guns under this law.  It is obvious, then, that they did not get their guns from a gun show or private sales, as Mr. Raskin is concerned about.  H.R. 8 will also turn everyday, law-abiding citizens into criminals if it becomes law.  Let's look at the amendments that were rejected by the Democrats in the Rules Committee and in the Committee on the Judiciary that offered to protect law-abiding citizens from becoming criminals.  First, there was an amendment--I thought commonsense--that someone thinking of committing suicide would be exempted from temporarily turning over their gun to a friend, and it is not allowed under this bill. They would become a criminal.  So, somebody who wants to commit suicide could not transfer their gun to someone else.  If a law-abiding citizen wanted to let someone temporarily use their gun on their own property, they would become a criminal under this bill.  If a farmer or rancher wanted to temporarily lend a gun to a ranch hand for the purposes of ranch activities, the farmer would become a criminal under this law.  If a domestic violence victim was in fear for her life and wanted to temporarily borrow a gun from a friend to protect herself, she would become a criminal under this law.  Let's also look at some commonsense amendments rejected by the Democrats that would have prevented undue burdens and duplication on law-abiding citizens who have already passed a background check but now have to go through another background check under this law.  People who have security clearances. This is the application to get a government security clearance, page upon page, background check, extensive background check. Yet, someone who has this and has gone through this still has to get another background check.  People who have a concealed carry weapon issued by a State, they have to go through another background check.  People who have already gotten a gun permit from States which require them; they have to go through another background check.  People who have global entry, who have gone through a background check, they have got to do it again under this bill.  Even law enforcement officers. Law enforcement officers have to go through another background check under this bill.  This is placing undue burden on law-abiding citizens.  Now I want to share testimony from a young woman from the Judiciary Committee. This woman was a victim of rape on her college campus. And the reason I am bringing it up is because well-meaning gun control laws actually prevented her from carrying a gun to school because the State she traveled through did not allow her to carry a gun in order to defend herself.  This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens--not criminals, law-abiding citizens--who follow the law and how this young woman and others like her were actually harmed by well-intentioned gun control laws.  As a survivor of domestic violence, I know all too well how hard it can be to protect oneself or find a lifeline out. My abuser often controlled all my finances. I wouldn't have been able to pay for a background check or a gun.  Sometimes getting a gun from a friend could actually be your only option; yet, unfortunately, under this bill, I tried to offer an amendment, but it was rejected.  Now let's turn to H.R. 1112, which changes the length of time that a background check has to be completed from the current 3 days to 10 business days and then another 10 business days for an appeal. So it could be 20-plus days.  The reason I am bringing this up is I want to tell you a story--a real story--about Carol Bowne. She was a New Jersey woman who was stabbed to death while waiting to be approved for her firearm application.  She already had an order of protection through the courts, but that wasn't enough. She needed more than just that piece of paper.  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a month--20 days to a month--like Carol. How many women will potentially suffer like Carol?  H.R. 8 also has other problems.  Unfortunately, the debate in the Judiciary Committee was cut short. Many commonsense amendments were not even heard. Only 10 amendments out of 100 were heard before the chairman cut off debate.  Because of the rush to get this bill through, there is another problem. There is vague language that is not defined and, thus, is open to interpretation.  I know, in some of the amendments, the majority party has tried to give an alternative to my good, commonsense domestic violence amendments, but it doesn't do any good. And this is the reason; it is because the language is so vague.  It says: Under H.R. 8, a person is allowed to temporarily transfer a firearm if it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm.  The question is: There is no definition of this, so how long is a temporary transfer? Who determines that? Does the victim determine it?  Who determines if there is imminent death? Does it qualify if a victim of domestic violence thinks they will be killed? Or does the person transferring the gun have to be in the same room and there be some kind of shootout and they throw a gun to them?  What do ``imminent danger'' and ``imminent death'' mean?  With something as important as the Second Amendment, I think we owe it to the American people to do our work and take as long as we have to in order to have a fair and open debate on major pieces of legislation.  Mr. Speaker, with that, I urge opposition to the rule, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a statement by the National Task Force to End Sexual & Domestic Violence, which is in favor of this legislation and against any weakening amendments. Just to quote a small part of it: ``Firearms pose a significant danger to victims of domestic violence, and this is true no matter who owns the firearm. Research shows that a male abuser's access to a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold and does not support the contention that firearm possession is a protective factor for the victim.''  And there is more in here of interest.  I would like to thank my distinguished colleague from Arizona for her thoughts on the question of sexual and domestic violence.  We, indeed, have a provision within the legislation which allows for an exemption from the background check requirement in cases of an imminent threat of great bodily harm.  The question has been raised: Does that include sexual assault, dating partner violence, stalking, and so on? We thought it was self-evident that it did, but, in any event, Representatives Horn from Oklahoma and Murphy from Florida are introducing a clarifying amendment to be very specific that it is included.  At that point, perhaps we could welcome the support of the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona, because we are being very clear at that point that our exception for imminent bodily harm and violence includes sexual assault and so on.  I am certain that the gentlewoman's intentions are good, just as are the intentions of the offerers of the amendment in the bill.  Let me just address, in case the gentlewoman hasn't decided to come over to our side now, some of the general points that were made against the legislation.  The gentlewoman articulated an argument we have been hearing a lot of from our counterparts, which is that criminals don't follow the law and, therefore, there is no reason to get rid of the loopholes and strengthen the law, because criminals won't follow the law.  Now, the fallacy of that argument is plain to see. It is an argument against all law.  It is an argument against the law against murder because murderers obviously don't follow the law against murder.  It is an argument against the law opposed to theft because thieves don't follow the law against theft.  But I think anyone who takes time to really study what law is understands that the purpose of the law is to deter people from negative, socially harmful action, the way that the Brady Act has deterred more than 3 million people--felons, fugitives, the mentally unstable, and other unauthorized categories--from accessing a weapon.  Now, that argument sweeps so broadly that it is an argument against having the Brady Act that we have now, and perhaps that is the intention, simply to take down the law that we have got now.  Another purpose of law, of course, is to punish people who violate it and then, again, to send a moral message about what the social norms are.  And we have got social norms about driving, for example. Would we say we are not going to have driver's licenses in America because people who drive without a driver's license ignore the law requiring you to have a driver's license?  It is a completely nonsensical argument.  Let's come back to reality and talk about what the Brady Act actually requires the gun dealers to ask people.  Here are the basic questions that are being asked:  Are you under indictment for or have you ever been convicted of a felony?  Are you a fugitive from justice?  Are you an unlawful user of a controlled substance?  Do you suffer from mental illness?  Have you been dishonorably discharged from the Armed Forces?  Are you subject to a court order restraining you from harassing, stalking, or threatening your child or an intimate partner?  Have you ever been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence?  Have you renounced your United States citizenship?  Are you unlawfully present in the United States?  Mr. Speaker, those questions have created a dragnet that has allowed us to stop more than 3 million people from getting weapons who shouldn't have them.  But there are these big, gaping loopholes out there that they can go on the Internet and get one, or they can go to the parking lot of a convenience store in a private sale and get one, or they can go to a gun show and negotiate a private sale and get one without having to answer those questions.  Well, the American people have spoken on this. That is really why this is the first legislation advocating gun safety to hit the floor of the House of Representatives in a quarter of a century.  This is a great day for the gun safety movement that has overtaken America, rejecting the unconscionable toll of 100 people dead every single day in communities across the land.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), the sponsor of the underlying bill, H.R. 8, who has done such a magnificent job advocating this cause through thick and thin."

But in the course of this debate, House Democrats say they want to do something to end gun violence and anyone who disagrees with their policies doesn't care.  I believe in my heart that the gentleman from Maryland and the folks on the other side of this debate care about the victims of gun violence and the children in this country, and I know in my heart that my colleagues on this side of the aisle and I care, too.  It is a shame that in their rush to do something, anything, Democrats have made this a partisan show. They won't even allow my bipartisan concealed carry reciprocity bill that passed this House last Congress to be debated on the House floor today.  What about the single mother victim of assault, like Shaneen Allen? Does she not have the right to defend herself?  Instead of working on commonsense solutions that can actually help prevent tragedies--like supporting local law enforcement, ensuring laws and protocols are followed, improving mental health, and implementing my concealed carry reciprocity--they are targeting law-abiding citizens, and they are disregarding existing Federal law.  There is no gun show loophole. Federal law already requires a background check on every commercial gun purchase in America no matter where it takes place. Federal law already prohibits so-called straw purchases.  Let's make one thing clear: H.R. 8 would not have stopped Newtown. H.R. 8 would not have stopped Parkland. It would not have stopped Las Vegas or Sutherland Springs or San Bernardino or the tragic attack on our former colleague, Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.  But the proponents of gun control don't want you to judge them based on outcomes; they want you to judge them based on intentions. And they say anyone who points out the facts, anyone who dares observe the obvious flaws in their legislation, does so because they don't care.  In their rush to do something, House Democrats ignore that House Republicans have done many things, like strengthening the background check system, which would have prevented Sutherland Springs; improving mental healthcare, which would have prevented many of these shootings such as Newtown and Charleston and Parkland; and giving schools the tools they need to protect students. All these bills received bipartisan support in the last Congress, but we don't get credit for real action because they say our intentions weren't good enough.  We owe it to the American people to look past the intention and the emotion and focus like a laser on outcomes. What can we do to actually end gun violence once and for all?  So what is this bill actually going to do?  It is going to turn a law-abiding American into a criminal when you loan your shotgun to your buddy to go dove hunting.  It is going to make it illegal for a victim of stalking to borrow a gun from a neighbor for protection.  It is going to make the cost of background checks so expensive that the average American can't afford to buy a gun. Meanwhile, criminals are going to continue to get their firearms, whether it is through theft or the black market or on the street.  I applaud President Donald Trump for standing with us against this ineffective legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''  The American people want us to work together to solve this problem and stop gun violence. Can't we come together in a bipartisan way and not just do something, but do something that will actually make a difference?  I am calling on my colleagues to put partisanship aside. Work together on ideas that will actually make a difference. I stand ready to continue this work. I will work with anyone to end gun violence while also protecting the rights of law-abiding citizens, and I reject the false dilemma that we can't do both.  Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I suppose that we are in a rush to do anything, something, anything that works in order to curb the terrible toll of gun violence on our society.  In the last Congress it is true there was other legislation that was brought to us. One was a proposal to legalize silencers in America, which sounds to me more like an agenda of organized crime than it is of the U.S. Congress trying to seek public safety.  But there was this bipartisan Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, which was a massive assault on federalism and States' rights. It would have destroyed every State's concealed carry law in the country to a level at the lowest common denominator. So if you could get a license to carry a concealed loaded weapon in one State--and in some States there are more than a million people who have been able to get them through completely permissive and lax laws--then you could go anywhere in the country. That is their proposal. That is what is coming out of the loophole factory.  I just would like to assure my friend that we have a provision in our legislation, if you read it carefully, which says that you can temporarily transfer a gun at a shooting range, at a shooting gallery, or for purposes of hunting, so he doesn't have to worry about this.  Our friends are either not reading carefully enough or they are overlooking very clear passages in our legislation which deal with commonsense concerns.  This is bipartisan legislation. It is backed by more than 90 percent of the American people, and it is going to advance common safety. So rather than searching for mysterious reasons to oppose it, why shouldn't everybody get together to say this is something that will promote the public safety?  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor)."

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this rule and H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. I am proud to be a cosponsor, and I thank Congressman Thompson for his leadership.  Our bill is intended to ensure that individuals who are prohibited from owning a firearm are not able to possess one.  Representative Raskin is right. America is in the midst of a gun violence emergency. Each year, 120,000 Americans are injured by a firearm; 35,000 Americans die; and of those, 17,000 who are injured and killed are children.  No other country in the world suffers the ravages of gun violence, and I am afraid we have become numb to it. But we don't have to accept it, and we are not, because we are going to finally pass legislation here today.  Mass shootings are on the rise. Military-style assault weapons are deadlier than ever. People are being gunned down in churches, schools, movie theaters, nightclubs, and synagogues.  For so many years, the Republican-led Congress blocked action on commonsense gun safety laws. But, finally, to the American people: We heard you; to the students who marched for their lives: We are finally going to act.  It is time now. I urge adoption of this bipartisan bill, the rule. It is a vote for the safety of our communities and our families."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to address a couple of things that were said previously.  I had sponsored an amendment, as a survivor of domestic violence, to allow victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse who have orders of protection to be able to get transferred a gun if they might be in fear for their life.  As I have said, often victims of domestic violence don't have the financial means or they are so restricted by their perpetrator that it is difficult for them to go out and purchase a gun, let alone get a background check, and so they might have a friend whom they can borrow it from.  Now, in response, I think, Mr. Raskin, if I am not mistaken, said that the Democrats did help domestic violence victims. I just don't think that their amendment cuts it, and I am going to read the amendment if this is the one that the gentleman is talking about.  It says: A temporary transfer that is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm, if the possession by the transferee lasts only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the imminent death or great bodily harm--and then here is the amendment--including the harm of domestic violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.  I would say just because you add the words ``domestic violence,'' ``victims of domestic abuse'' doesn't mean this is going to help; and the reason is simply because of what I said before, that these terms in here are really unclear. I really would like somebody to explain, and they are not defined anywhere, who determines prevent imminent death or great bodily harm?  So, let's say I am a victim of domestic violence and I think my perpetrator is going to kill me. Does imminent death and, in this word, say, last only as long as immediately necessary to prevent the imminent death? So does that mean the person who--my friend who can lend me a gun has to be right there in the same room and see that there is imminent death coming?  I mean, there is no definition here. So it is unclear to me that this would help at all.  Also, what is the definition of ``temporary transfer''? How long is that? How long is temporary transfer? Does that mean, you know, just enough time you can throw somebody a gun while they are imminently in death? I mean, do you have to be right there? What does this mean? There is no definition.  So, if we are going to proceed with this, I think that we should at least define what these terms mean. Therefore, I really wish that my amendment that said that victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse that have an order of protection through the court--through the court--would be allowed to at least borrow a gun to defend themselves from, maybe, a friend.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to thank my colleague for advancing our discussion here because I think now we are really starting to get somewhere.  The gentlewoman suggested an amendment which allows for the transfer of a firearm to a victim of domestic violence or sexual assault who has an order of protection issued by a court. That is an extremely narrow exception.  Most women who are enduring domestic violence don't have a civil protection order. Part of that is because of the incompetence of the laws in a lot of States, and part of it is because they haven't had the wherewithal to go and get one.  But our legislation and our amendment sweeps much more broadly. It allows any woman who is a victim of domestic violence, who faces a threat from their attacker, to be loaned a gun by a family member or be loaned a gun by a friend until the threat is resolved.  My friend suggests that there is something ambiguous about the words. I just don't see the ambiguity. Their original argument attacked the utility of all criminal law, saying we shouldn't have criminal laws, essentially, because criminals won't follow them.  This seems like an attack on law itself. Law depends upon language. But the language is clear here that if there is a threat and if you are suffering from the threat of domestic violence, sexual assault and so on, then you can get the gun.  Who interprets it? Well, you have got the right to go out and get it. If someone were to prosecute you for doing that, the prosecution would clearly lose.  So I am afraid that our friends are looking for problems in this bipartisan legislation which simply don't exist.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member on the Judiciary Committee and senior member on the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security Subcommittee, I, too, am glad of the underlying discussion regarding the protecting of women.  I rise today to support H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, to close the gun show loophole, supported by 80 percent of the American people, so unlicensed dealers cannot, undercover, out of the back of their trunk, sell to people who would create and perpetrate either mass murders or individual abuse and gun violence.  I also support H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, that would, in fact, have stopped the deaths at the Mother Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina, where worshippers were shot down, nine of them.  To listen to the debate in the Judiciary Committee, 10 hours of rebuffing these simple legislative initiatives, I beg of my colleagues to stand with us. It is clear that we have an amendment, Horn and Murphy, that clarifies great bodily harm, includes domestic violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse. We want women to be protected and others involved in domestic abuse circumstances.  My amendment that will be brought up as well will provide the information as to how many times the FBI has had to deal with petitions that have been denied.  Let us not have another 20 years before we have bills that deal with gun safety legislation. Let's do it now.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule governing debate on H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019'' and H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Check Act of 2019,'' as well as the underlying legislation.  These legislative proposals address and strengthen the background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not required to run a background check, and that 96 percent of inmates who were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they committed their crime obtained their gun this way.  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers sell a large number of guns.  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who is not so licensed without a background check.  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary background check before the transfer could be finalized.  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy manner to ensure firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) demonstrated that NICS background checks are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within 90 seconds.  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would strengthen the background check procedures federal firearms licensees or dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a background check on prospective buyers using the NICS.  Over 90% of checks are completed within 90 seconds so if the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.  After another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.  Thus, under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days have passed, since the initial background check.  Mr. Speaker, the American people are demanding effective action to reduce, if not prevent altogether, the countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more than 2015.  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and violence deterrence.  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 mass shootings in 2018.  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest music festival on the Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.  And on November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley killed 26 and injured 20 others.  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--as much as 114 percent higher than other States.  A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent increase in a State's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.  Gun death rates are generally lower in States with restrictions such as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.  Because more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally, stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands.  And that begins with passing H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' and H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Check Act of 2019.''  I urge all Members to support the rule and the underlying legislation when it comes to the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would like to refute some of the things, or talk about some of the things said by my friends on the other side.  One of the things that I do want to talk about is that Mr. Raskin said that my amendment is such a narrow exception for domestic violence victims. I had a broader one in Judiciary Committee, if the gentleman remembers, and Chairman Nadler told me that it was too broad, that it was too vague, so that is why I made it very specific.  If the gentleman would like, I will make it broad again. Also in the Rules Committee, there was another amendment as well, and we are both on Rules, too, of course.  There was a broader one from Mr. Scalise, who is a victim of gun violence. He had an amendment that was ruled out of order. That basically said any victim of domestic violence, which was broad, but then he had another subsection that said victim of domestic violence or sexual abuse that has an order of protection. So we covered both, yet it was ruled out of order. So we really tried.  Now, the other thing that you brought up, that it is very clear what imminent danger means, and that would cover somebody, and surely a domestic violence victim would not become a criminal under this law. Well, I don't think it is very sure.  So I ask Mr. Raskin, my colleague, if he would be open to removing the word ``imminent'' and just say ``danger,'' instead of ``imminent danger,'' because to me, ``imminent danger'' means you have to be right in the same room, you know, and throw somebody a gun or something. I mean, to me, the word ``imminent'' needs to be removed from the language.  The other thing I would like to talk about is the number of times now my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said: Oh, so many people support this universal background check.  Well, I disagree. I disagree, because there is proof right in Maine. They had a ballot measure, and it was rejected by the majority of the people.  I suppose it depends on how you ask the question, but I just don't think that when you get into the details of how it takes away our fundamental Second Amendment rights and actually burdens law-abiding citizens and actually may harm people, some of these laws--like was the case with the young woman who testified in Judiciary who said that good-intentioned gun laws actually prevented her from defending herself, and she was raped.  So I would say I have some disagreements with some of your statements.  I also want to point out that there are many things that we can do on a bipartisan basis, and this obviously is not bipartisan. I am a co-chairwoman of the Women's Caucus in Congress, and I have talked to my counterpart, a very nice woman and Congresswoman. We really do want to work on bipartisan solutions to gun violence. I would say one of those is let's really concentrate on mental health issues.  Now, we have done some things in the past. We did the Fix NICS Act, which we passed last year on a bipartisan basis, which really is an attempt to fix the national background system so that local jurisdictions actually report when there are problems, which I think is very valuable.  We also did legislation in a bipartisan manner that would protect our schools more.  Here is another thing we could do in a bipartisan manner. As you have noted, 3.5 million people have been stopped by NICS since 1994 from getting guns, and 112,000 were stopped just last year. But you know what? Only 12 of those 112,000 were actually prosecuted. Why? I mean, we have laws on the books now, and we are not even enforcing them. So I think that is another thing we can do on a bipartisan basis.  Again, this bill, I believe, does more harm than good. I do think my colleagues are well intentioned. I do believe that all of us, whether we are Republican or Democrat, want to reduce gun violence.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might consume.  Mr. Speaker, first, to clarify one thing, this is bipartisan legislation. We have at least five Republicans who are cosponsoring and supporting this legislation. I assume my friend doesn't mean to read those five Republican Members of the House of Representatives out of her caucus.  I am not quite sure what happened in Maine, but I know that there are around a dozen States and the District of Columbia that have already gotten rid of the loopholes that we are going to get rid of today in this Federal legislation.  My friend also invokes Second Amendment rights. I thought that we had put that red herring to rest in 2008 in Heller v. District of Columbia. Justice Scalia said that reasonable regulation to screen out felons and fugitives and the mentally unstable is perfectly consistent with the Second Amendment.  Everybody on both sides of the aisle favors the Second Amendment, along with the rest of the Bill of Rights. If you are going to oppose this legislation, you have to base it on some public safety rationale and not pretend like anybody has made a constitutional argument, because nobody has made a constitutional argument.  Finally, on the question of the domestic violence amendment, I would invite my friend to come on over, and we would gladly have unanimous consent to have her added to the amendment, which is the broader amendment she is talking about. Of course, her amendment was the narrow one, which required you to have a civil protection order before there would be an exception from the provisions of the legislation.  She said she was misdirected by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. All I can say is the legislative process is a treacherous place and a rocky road for people in the minority. I have been dealing with that for several years. In any event, we would love to have you join the amendment now. Mr. Speaker, I make that offer to my friend.

Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, I spoke at a town hall sponsored by students at Bancroft High School in Worcester, Massachusetts. Those young people demanded action on gun violence, not unlike other young people all across my district and all across this country. They are terrified, and they are tired of seeing one massacre after another after another after another. They are sickened by the unacceptable high rate of gun violence in this country.  We have an obligation to be on their side, not on the side of the gun lobby.  In fact, most gun owners agree with what we are doing here today. Ninety-seven percent of gun-owning households support universal background checks. You don't see support like that on very many things, but on this issue, the public is speaking loud and clear. The question is whether Congress is going to listen.  My office has been flooded with calls on this year after year after year, and I have heard from loved ones of victims killed and from those injured. I know many of my colleagues can say the same thing. It is heartbreaking.  Each of us is in a unique position. We can do more than just listen. We can act. We can actually vote to help save lives.  Sadly, past majorities have turned a deaf ear. In fact, it has been nearly a decade since the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on a major bill to combat gun violence. When they were in charge, my Republican friends on the other side instead held a hearing on a bill that would have actually brought more guns from out of State into local communities.  Their indifference on this issue of gun violence, their silence, has been stunning. But this majority is not satisfied with inaction. We will not be cowed by the gun lobby.  We are moving legislation, in the case of H.R. 8, that has been in the works for more than 20 years. The time for inaction is over.  Listen to the young people in your districts. They are not content with a future where gun violence is the norm. They want and they deserve better.

Since 2014, nearly 400 of my constituents have died by gun violence. Our community feels their loss every single day. Here are just a few of their names and tragic stories.  Davon Ellis: Davon was a star football player and an excellent student at Oakland Tech High School. He was shot and killed while walking home from school. My nephew was walking with him when he was gunned down.  Travon Godfrey: Travon was killed in 2016 while sitting in a car with his friends in front of his home.

This amendment is crucial to saving lives.  As a survivor of domestic violence, I know what it is like to be in fear for our lives.  This commonsense amendment is clearcut. If you are a victim with an order of protection, you can borrow a firearm or transfer a firearm to you. It is important, because victims don't often have the means to purchase or go pay for a background check.  The Democrats have presented a letter from the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence as a reason for not needing my amendment. However, with all due respect, the National Task Force does not speak for every victim, and they certainly do not speak for me. In fact, they never even contacted me, and I have been an outspoken person saying I am a survivor of domestic violence since I ran for Congress. I am also the person who sponsored the amendment to extend the Violence Against Women Act, yet they have never talked to me or reached out to my office.

If you go back and read any of the social contracts--there is Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, or Thomas Jefferson--any of them say, we leave a state of nature, which is a state of war and a state of violence, in order to live in a civilized way.  But how civilized is it when tens of thousands of Americans, every year, are being killed in firearm violence? Every day, another hundred Americans are killed with guns.  In 2017, the highest level in 40 years, nearly 40,000 Americans died from gun violence. That is not a civilized state. That is a state of war. That is a state of violence.  We know what the loopholes are, and we are going to close the loopholes with our bipartisan legislation, which has support from Republicans and it has support from Democrats. The public opinion polls show that more than 95 percent of the American people support what we are trying to do here--close the gun show loophole, close the private sale loophole, close the internet loophole--make sure that everybody who purchases a gun in America is purchasing it only with the universal comprehensive mental and criminal background check.  We have amendments for the discrete exceptions that are necessary, including in cases of imminent violence, including rape and sexual assault via domestic violence. We think that this legislation is excellent legislation that every Member of Congress should feel proud voting for.  Mr. Speaker, I submit both H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Check Act, as well as the bill to close the Charleston loophole, so that criminals are not given guns after 3 days. We are able to delay that process in the event that more investigation is needed."

These critical bills would ensure that there is a comprehensive background check on every firearm purchase, something that 97 percent of American voters, including 97 percent of gun-owning households, support.  H.R. 8 requires background checks on all firearm sales, including those conducted by unlicensed gun sellers, closing what has become known as the ``gun show loophole.''  H.R. 1112 closes another loophole in current statute that allows gun dealers to transfer a firearm after three business days if they have not received a definitive response from the background check system.  Tragically, this gap became known as the ``Charleston loophole'' when it contributed to the brutal murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in 2015.  Congress must act immediately on the ABCs of gun violence prevention.  A is for Assault Weapons Ban.  B is for Background Checks Reform.  C is for Closing the Gun Show Loophole.

President Trump's decision to declare a national emergency at the southern border to siphon funds for his border wall is an unconstitutional, grotesque abuse of power.  An emergency declaration is not a last-ditch maneuver to employ when all negotiation attempts have failed. The House of Representatives has rejected the President's border wall. The Senate has rejected the border wall. And the American people have rejected this useless wall.  The President does not get to override Congress in a raucous temper tantrum over his inability to broker a deal. The National Emergencies Act was enacted in 1976 to expedite the allocation of resources for real emergencies to save American lives and mitigate damage caused by natural disasters and acts of terror. It was not fashioned to allow a President to deny the will of Congress and the American people.  Both Democrats and Republicans alike should be very concerned about the ramifications of this unprecedented executive action. It is a direct threat to the balance of power that our country was built upon and a violation of our Nation's Constitution.  There is also no factual basis for the emergency declaration. Immigration from the southern border has significantly decreased in the last 10 years. Any attempts to characterize the border as a crisis zone are flagrant abuses of statistics, which have shown that border crossings are at the lowest they have been in 40 years.  President Trump has long proved he is not married to the truth or facts, and he has no proof to substantiate his wild claims about the status of the United States and the Mexican border.  We cannot abandon our commitment to responsible governing and the truth because President Trump is outraged at his inability to fulfill a campaign promise.  There is wide bipartisan support for this measure, and our democracy demands that we condemn this subversion of our Constitution and this misuse of Presidential power.

National security is obviously the President's highest priority, and I support his efforts to build a wall.  There is a crisis. There is a crisis at the border that could have been addressed much sooner and prevented. Open border policies of the last administration compounded this growing problem.  We have schools, hospitals, and other services that have become overcrowded. American workers have been hurt by reduced job opportunities and lower wages. At the same time, human and drug trafficking has thrived.  In many communities, the notorious MS-13 gang has grown. We have seen tragic cases of crimes committed by illegal aliens who have been deported not once, not even twice, but multiple times.  I want to cite just one example from my home State of Missouri. A man named Pablo Serrano-Vitorino was deported to Mexico after a felony conviction in 2003. He later returned to this country illegally and was arrested again in 2014 and 2015 after several more violent incidents, but he remained in the U.S.  Then, in 2016, this individual, who had no right to be in this country, was charged for murdering five people in Kansas City, Kansas, and Montgomery County, Missouri.  Stories like this are not unique to Missouri, Mr. Speaker. These horrifying events are happening across this country.  This is a crisis. The men and women who put their lives on the line every day to bring order and security to our borders deserve the tools that they need to do the job, and now this President is taking decisive action to finally address the crisis using the authority provided to him by the Congress.  The National Emergencies Act is very clear. The provisions the President will use under title 10 explicitly provide the President with clear authority.  I support the President's efforts.

This is the most consequential vote we will take in a generation on the balance of powers between the legislative and the executive branches of government, whether we will respect the separation of powers enshrined in our Constitution, stand up for Congress, for this country, and for the Constitution, or whether we will stand down, in favor of the President.  The precedent that may be set today and this week, or next week when the Senate votes if Congress allows this President's emergency declaration to stand will not have ramifications only on this matter or the building of a border wall. If the President is successful, he will likely come back for more. He will likely circumvent Congress again, in the same unconstitutional way.  Not only will this President do it, future Presidents will do it.  I ask you this: How are we to tell a future President, if this President is successful, that gun deaths, which number in the tens of thousands, are not a national emergency, that opioid deaths are not a national emergency, that climate change is not a national emergency?  This will allow a President to sideline Congress from much of domestic policy.  Bear in mind, over the years, Congress has already, on its own, I believe, given up a lot of its authority with respect to foreign policy.  It is also clear that there is no emergency at the border. Border crossings are at a four-decade low. The folks who are coming today are presenting themselves to Border Patrol agents seeking asylum, not trying to get around the border.  There are more law enforcement officers at our border--Federal, State, and local officers--than at any time in our Nation's history.  Since its founding, this country has become the most powerful and prosperous on the face of the Earth without a border wall. That is why most Americans disagree with the President usurping the power of Congress to build his border wall.  In fact, not only do they disagree with that, they disagree with using military construction money on this border project. Cities like mine, San Antonio, stand to lose millions of dollars in military construction.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this resolution."

The statutes don't provide for national emergencies on climate change. They don't allow for national emergencies on gun violence. But they do allow it in terms of this particular issue.  The President is exactly right. There is a crisis at the border, Mr. Speaker. But not only this President recognizes it. The previous President, Obama, in 2014, did as well when he requested $3.7 billion in emergency spending to secure the border.  Where was the outrage then? Where was the outrage from my colleagues across the aisle?  President Obama even went further to say that we needed to secure our border to deter both adults and children from the dangerous journey that they embarked on.  Where was the outrage across the aisle then, Mr. Speaker? It was not there.  Keeping criminals, human traffickers, and drug smugglers away from our communities is paramount. Yes, indeed, we do have an opioid problem. We have actually appropriated billions of dollars to address that. And yet, somehow, the drugs flowing across our southern border are not a crisis?  Again, President Obama seemed to agree with this and declared a national emergency for transnational criminal organizations, specifically calling out Mexico's Los Zetas gang, and provided more authority for ICE to actually combat that; a national emergency. Where was the outrage across the aisle then?  But we don't even have to look just at the previous administration. President Clinton also declared a national emergency to go after narcotics traffickers.  Mr. Speaker, I just find it just unbelievable that here today, that we have got these newfound constitutionalists across the aisle, wanting to rein in the President's authority.

We must reject this unlawful power grab and reassert Congress' authority to exercise the power of the purse. The Constitution could not be clearer: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.'' That command reflects a fundamental principle that is older than our democracy itself: The chief executive cannot unilaterally spend taxpayers' money or redirect a budget set by the people's representatives.  Earlier this year, Congress reached a bipartisan compromise to fund the government, and it was signed by the President. Congress allocated limited funding for fencing in certain areas, but squarely rejected the President's request to build a medieval barrier across the southern border.  Almost immediately, the President decided to rewrite the budget set by Congress, and he told us exactly why. He was not satisfied with what he got from the process that the Constitution dictates, so he did an end run and made it an emergency.  He and his aides have barely even tried to pretend that the so-called emergency is a real one. They know that illegal immigration is at historically low levels. They know that children and families fleeing violence are coming here to make lawful asylum claims, not as some kind of invading army.  They know that illegal drugs overwhelmingly get smuggled through ports of entry, and that a wall would do nothing to change that. But they refuse to let the facts and the law stand in the way of their political agenda.  Even worse, the emergency law that President Trump invoked allows the military to redirect funds only if an emergency ``requires the use of the armed forces.'' And those funds can be used only for construction projects that are ``necessary to support such use of the armed forces.''  But a wall cannot possibly be ``necessary to support'' a military operation on the border because our laws prohibit the military from engaging in law enforcement activities. The military cannot enforce an immigration law, so the President's actions are doubly unlawful. There is no real emergency; and even if there were, the President could not redirect military funds for a purpose expressly prohibited to the military.  Fortunately, the Constitution does not get suspended based on President Trump's preferences about what is convenient or ``faster.'' Our Nation's Founders left it up to all of us, including those of us in Congress, to act as guardians against exactly this type of assault on our constitutional order.  In that spirit, I proudly support this joint resolution, and I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand up and do the same."

Mr. Speaker, I am glad about one thing today coming here. I am glad that, for many of the years I have been here, I came through the Rules Committee, and others, and talked about Article I authority. I am glad now to see that we have others who have now figured that Article I probably needs to be enforced.  What is interesting is it is selective enforcement against a President they don't like, for a purpose they don't want, for a wall that they don't want to have because securing a border is not the top agenda for them.  I get it if you don't like it. But argue with the law. The statute itself and the President's actions, in accordance with it, rest solidly within the separation of powers, and are certainly constitutional.  If you are citing the Supreme Court case of Youngstown against the President's action today during this debate, then I suggest you haven't read the case. That reasoning of the Youngstown case only applies when the President is acting unilaterally and not pursuant to a duly-elected statute by Congress.  Maybe the selective memory here is because the previous President actually did that when he instituted the DACA program under no things that he could have found to actually work on.  Then we discuss the issue of, is there an actual emergency on the border? You know, a President once noted, he said: ``We have seen a significant rise in apprehensions and processing of children and individuals from Central America who are crossing into the United States in the Rio Grande Valley areas of the Southwest border. The individuals who embark upon this perilous journey are subject to violent crime, abuse, extortion, as they rely on dangerous human smuggling networks to transport them through Central America and Mexico.''  Most may think that was from the current President. It was not. It was from President Obama when he was requesting more money for the emergency on the border.  The problem is the factual basis is there. We sat in a hearing today in the Judiciary Committee, and I had to look at the faces of our Border Patrol agents and ICE agents, and others dealing with this on a day-to-day basis while all they get, many times from this body, is hate and derision when they are doing their job that we sent them to do.  My problem comes back here--if we can argue about different things--this was under the law and done by Republicans and Democrats for the last almost 40 years. If you want to fix this, then you have done what you should do under law. You have brought your resolution of disapproval.  But if you really wanted to take Article I authority, then actually look at the law itself. If you actually want to change it that is what this body ought to be doing.  If you don't like the fact that the President can do something and especially my friends across the aisle who don't want this President to do anything, then fix the law. Go into this emergency declaration and say, we will define what a national emergency is. We will do that.  They don't want to do that because they don't want to bind the hands because they know that the law was written for a purpose that has been upheld for over 40 years. This is simply a show. It is a farce.  Let's just get to the political aspect of this and say, Mr. Speaker, we don't like the President. We don't like what he is doing. Oops, we forgot about this law, and the President said, I will act under the authority given to me by Congress.  You can have all the arguments you want, but at the end of the day, Mr. Speaker, when you cast this vote, don't hide behind Article I. Don't hide between separation of powers. Go to the law and look at what the law says and vote ``no.''"

But today, that flow of Mexican men has been replaced with a mix of men, women, and children from Central American countries.  Human traffickers are exploiting the loopholes in our laws and understand how our immigration system is broken. These smugglers tell vulnerable families that their child is like their ``visa'' to stay in the U.S., if they can just get themselves turned in to the border patrol. And these smugglers and their propaganda are effective.  Family apprehensions for fiscal year 2019 are already 572 percent higher than fiscal year 2013. And these traffickers don't care about the people they smuggle. The result is that immigrants of all ages are arriving on our doorstep in terrible health.  Border Patrol projects a 133 percent increase over last year in migrants needing medical treatment after crossing the border. These changing migrant flows force our law enforcement officers to act as paramedics, rather than enforcing the laws that Congress has passed.  We need an ``all-of-the-above'' approach to border security, and that includes manpower, 21st century technology, and barriers. With this approach, we will deter human smugglers and others crossing hundreds of miles of open desert with innocent children.  We know this approach works. In areas where we have built a wall system, such as Yuma, illegal traffic has plummeted by 95 percent. Let's build on this success.

Texas knows something others in this Chamber apparently don't know: We are at war on the southern border with the drug cartels.  I say it again. We are at war on the southern border with the drug cartels from Mexico.  The drug cartels are at the heart of every single problem we have on our southern border. They have a war going with our families, our kids, and our schools with record numbers of heroin, cocaine, and deadly fentanyl.  The drug cartels are at war with our world values by financing modern-day sex slaves or forced laborers.  All of Texas, 254 counties--from Amarillo to Texarkana, to Beaumont, to Brownsville, to Marfa--are impacted. They are at war with these drug cartels.  The majority had better wake up and have no more figments of imagination. It is time to put politics aside and admit we are at war with the drug cartels.

If there were a crisis, it is hard to imagine a worse or less effective response than a border wall, which will take months, if not years, to build.  What I did see there are efforts to harden ports of entry. In fact, just days before I arrived in El Paso, sharp barbed wire was installed in the middle of a busy port of entry. This barbed wire did not give off the impression that this busy port of entry was welcoming commerce or visitors to the United States. When questioned, officials could not say who had signed off on this project or how it fits into border security.  It is time for the administration to stop fear-mongering and accept reality. The only crisis on the border is a humanitarian crisis, one created by this administration, and a border wall will do nothing to alleviate the suffering.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, this issue is not about a wall. It is about the Constitution. It is about this institution. It is about the balance that we say is equal between the Article I institution and the Article II institution.  That is important to remember. That is why this argument is so very important.  It is not about just a single policy. It is about the kind of government that our Founding Fathers instituted, which has been the envy of the world and the example to many.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, Congressman Castro of Texas, and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for introducing this resolution.  I was at the border in California and in New Mexico just a few days ago. I was at the border in El Paso with my distinguished colleague, the former executive, called judge, of that area. She will speak shortly. Ms. Escobar will say there is no war at the border and there is no crisis at the border. She will explain that better than I can. She lives there.  At the border, I saw a lot of heartbreak and challenge, but I did not see a national emergency that would justify the President ignoring the Constitution and trying to make funding decisions without congressional approval. That is the issue.  For my colleagues to say this is a partisan issue, let me call your attention to the statements of approximately 20 Members of the United States Senate.  The President admitted on February 15 that this is not a true emergency when he said: ``I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this, but I'd rather do it much faster.''  Not that he needed to do it much faster, but he would just rather do it much faster. Of course, if the Mexicans were paying for it, perhaps he could have.  Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear that he cannot make an end run around the Constitution and claim powers reserved for the taxpayers' representatives.  Mr. Speaker, the Congress of the United States needs to have a spine and not lay at the feet of the President of the United States and say, ``Whatever you want, sir.'' That is not what the people elected us to do. We are their representatives, not the President's representative, whether it is President Obama, President Trump, President Clinton, President Bush, or President Reagan, all of whom I have served with--two Bushes.  Our Founding Fathers had enough of King George, so they adopted a Constitution that said: We are not going to have a King George. We are not going to have an authoritarian regime. We are not going to have the executive setting policy. They said the Congress sets policy.  By the way, 300 of us in this body voted for the funding levels for border security. It didn't squeak by, by some partisan advantage--300 of us, which is to say well over 66 percent.  Now, Congress has a chance to answer the President and make it clear. He demanded that the American taxpayers give him billions for the wall that Democrats and Republicans alike say is expensive and ineffective.  Again, this is not about the wall. This is about our Constitution, our institution, and our self-respect.  He has chosen to ignore the will of the American people, as expressed by their representatives. He has opted to set aside the wisdom of our Founders for the expedience of getting his own way.  Constitutional law professor Roger Sloane of Boston University noted, last week: ``To my knowledge, no President has ever tried to use national emergency funding to appropriate funds Congress refused to appropriate.''  Overwhelming Senate vote; overwhelming vote in this body.  He went on to say: ``Politically, it would mean the President would be seeking . . . to override a bipartisan judgment of Congress.''  Have we no self-respect? Have we no sense of the balance between the executive and the legislative branches of government?  We are the Article I branch, the policymakers, the people who raise money and spend money, not the President--any President, Republican or Democrat. And a lot of Republican colleagues, including Senator McConnell, said: Mr. President, don't do this.  Right up until the time Senator McConnell said: I will support you, Mr. President.  First, he was against this, and now he is for it.  The respected Harvard Law School constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe said of the President, on Thursday: ``He is simply trying to do what emperors and kings do, not what a President of the United States should do.''  In The Washington Post this weekend, columnist Max Boot noted why we are now at a pivotal moment for Members of the President's party in the Congress, who are being asked to choose between loyalty to the President and fidelity to the Constitution.  I am sorry the Chamber is not filled. I thought of asking for a quorum call. I didn't.  Fidelity to the President or fidelity to the Constitution, that is the choice we make today. That is why this is a pivotal moment. We choose between the Constitution and its principles, which have made our country the world's envied democracy for almost two and a half centuries.  Boot continued with this: ``Trump's action is an affront to all that Republicans stand for.''  The premise is you continue to stand for this institution and our Constitution.  ``They claim to be pro-military, but Trump's action would take money away from the defense budget. They claim to be pro-property rights, but Trump's action would result in the taking of private property along the border. And they claim to be constitutional conservatives, but Trump's action is an obvious violation of Article I of the Constitution: `No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.' ''  I used to have people coming up here and taking out the Constitution and saying: Have you read this document? Do you know what it says?  Let me repeat it: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.''  Now, I have heard the scare rhetoric, and I suggest to my colleagues, with all due respect, that kind of rhetoric has preceded every despot's takeover of power in the world. There was a crisis. They had to declare military law. They had to suspend the constitution and suspend the laws.  That is how despots take power. We stand at the gate to ensure that doesn't happen. But we will say more with our votes.  If we vote yes, we will say that Congress is still the voice of the American people. We will say that we are still faithful to the oath we took to protect the Constitution and laws of our land. And we will say that America, as our Founders promised, has no sovereign but we, the people--``we,'' not me, not I. We, the people.  We must not allow the President to set a dangerous precedent stripping Congress of its power of the purse. This is the first time. You can say there are a lot of other emergencies. That is correct. But this is unique. We must not allow him to set the precedent whereby any chief executive, Republican or Democrat, can declare an emergency any time he or she doesn't agree with Congress' funding.  This is not a partisan resolution. It is supported and encouraged by former and current Republican Members who recognize how dangerous it would be for the Congress not to act. A group of 23 former Republican Members of Congress, including former Senators Olympia Snowe, Dick Lugar, Chuck Hagel, and John Danforth have sent a letter to currently serving Republican Members yesterday. In it they wrote this: ``It has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to Presidents or party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional Republic, we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''  Today, a conservative Senator from North Carolina, a Republican conservative Senator from North Carolina, said this: ``I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress' power.'' Senators Murkowski and Collins have already said they would support this resolution.  So let us act and do so in one powerful voice--not as Democrats, not as Republicans, as Americans; as representatives; as people who have put their faith in us to make a judgment to protect their country, their Constitution; as Americans who believe in our Constitution and the wisdom of our Founders who gave Congress alone the authority to appropriate funds and gave the representatives of the people and the States a powerful check on the executive.  I ask all my Republican colleagues: How would you vote if Barack Obama were President of the United States today? Think of that. Because if you cannot answer ``I would vote the same way,'' then you are not being true to your country, to our Constitution, and to your oath.  If any Member cares at all about the equal status of the Article I branch of the Constitution, he or she should vote for this resolution. Vote for conscience and Constitution, not party and politics."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I want to start by saying something: Everybody here in this Chamber means well. Everybody here in this Chamber believes they are fighting for the right thing for this country.  Unfortunately, sometimes with these debates, they get heated and we begin to ascribe bad motives to the other side. I ascribe no bad motives to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and there are no bad motives on our side. It is just a little bit of a difference in how we see it.  We are all passionate about this issue, which is evident by the quality of the debate we are having here. But I am going to tell you why I came to believe that this was a national emergency.  I was sent down to the border with the National Guard. I went down and did 2 weeks with my unit, which is down there for 2 months.  As part-timers, we go down and we fill in and augment different amounts of time. I fly a surveillance aircraft. It is called an RC-26.  We actually work with Border Patrol, and what we would do is, through technology, some of the technology that exists, they would get indications of a group coming over the border. We would have a central authority that would see these groups coming over the border and would take the limited air assets we had and put them on these groups to surveil them and then coordinate with Border Patrol, or whatever, to come in and get them. And what we saw, frankly, was pretty eye-opening for me.  First off, Arizona has some very rugged territory.  I have worked Texas, by the way, three times doing this exact same mission. I am going to give you an opportunity to guess who the President was when I did this mission three other times. It was President Obama, because he understood the need for the guard on the border.  So we would see these groups come over. They would go through this rugged terrain.  By the way, I never worked an area in Arizona where there was a barrier. We never had to. But there is a lot of area that isn't.  We would then respond, and basically, 9 times out of 10, any time these groups got any indication that Border Patrol was nearby or there was an aircraft overhead, they would do what we call a bomb burst. It looks like that on the infrared we are using. They would run in all different directions, and many people would get separated.  But do you know who the first to bomb blast away from that group was? The first people, every time, were the coyotes who they paid their life savings to to bring them over the border--every time.  In fact, one time that exact scenario happened, and a lady was left lost in the desert, hunkered down in a bush. Had Border Patrol not found her--sure, she will be deported for that because she came in illegally. But if Border Patrol had not found her, I believe that there is a chance that she could have been one of the at least 200 bodies that they find every year in the desert because they are abandoned by their drug traffickers, by their coyotes who are paid for and who pay money to the drug cartels.  That is a big part of where these cartels in Mexico get their money, funneling people over the border, human trafficking. We know the statistics of the chance of assault during that. We know that kind of stuff.  It wasn't my mission, but my crew was on a mission, the very first one, where an illegal was apprehended, and he had 70 pounds of methamphetamine on him.  Now, I know there is way more than 70 pounds of methamphetamine out there in the United States, but there are way more people we are not seeing come over that border as well.  People sometimes look at the rugged terrain of Arizona and say, well, with mountains and hills, that is the natural wall.  By the way, I went hiking on those mountains and hills during my time off, I will say that.  But the other interesting thing is a significant amount of the people we were following were actually on those mountains and hills. They were on the mountains and hills because that rugged terrain is just as difficult for Border Patrol to navigate as them.  In fact, I watched as a Border Patrol helicopter followed a man probably 100 feet away. This is on video. Border Patrol can release this video if they want. The man was running. The Border Patrol cannot insert Border Patrol agents to capture him. This guy is still gone today. He had to have been a coyote or a drug trafficker.  Seeing this repeatedly made me realize this is not a national emergency because of immigration. I actually believe in comprehensive immigration reform. I want to work with the other side of the aisle to fix all these problems that I think we really actually all agree on. We just can't admit we agree on all this stuff. I look at this and I say this is an 80 percent solution that we can fix.  But when I came back from the border and I came back from seeing the real issue that makes this a national emergency--drugs, human trafficking--that is when I realized something had to be done.  A wall and a barrier is not compassionless. I think border security and compassion actually go hand in hand. Because what we are saying is: Come over to the United States of America, but do it the right and legal way, because, otherwise, these coyotes in the cartel are going to take advantage of you, take your life savings, and take you through a very dangerous route. And when the going gets tough, they are going to leave you to die, because they did that to 200 of them last year in Arizona.  It was an eye-opening experience.  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the passion everybody has in this. I respect everybody's debate in this. This is how I came to the conclusion I did.  Please vote ``no'' on this."

So I just don't understand that statement at all.  And Speaker Pelosi and Chuck Schumer recently said the crisis at the border is manufactured. I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that I live in the State of Arizona, a border State, and I have visited the border, and I have met with the border agents and border officials at the border.

That is a fabrication. The administration's own statistics show that crossings and apprehensions are at a historic low. The vast majority of illegal drugs come in at our ports of entry. A wall will not stop that.  Many who cross our borders are women and children. They are not running from border agents. They are seeking them out for help and for asylum.  Second, this will make life harder for America's military families, and, thus, hurt our national security. Who would ever intentionally make life tougher for the brave men and women who serve our country? It is monstrous, really, when you think about the sacrifices that they already make for this country.  As the chair of the Appropriations Committee Military Construction, Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Subcommittee, tomorrow I will hold a hearing to ask our service Secretaries exactly which projects they previously told us they really needed, but now should be sacrificed for a needless wall.  What will these leaders ask their troops to give up just so Trump can have a useless, wasteful wall? Training or intelligence facilities? Hangars for planes that cost billions? Schools for our military families' children? This is a power grab.  After failing to get his way in a funding dispute with Congress, Trump is throwing an unconstitutional temper tantrum. He is using the tools of an authoritarian, jeopardizing our military readiness to steal himself a wall that he could not get the lawful way. The dangerous precedent he will set is one that I hope all of my Republican colleagues will reject.  The President says a wall will keep Americans safe, but stealing funds from military families makes us all less safe.

Mr. Speaker, it is harder for me to imagine how a big, beautiful wall will somehow bestow upon us knowledge that people are jumping over it or going under it.  Those kinds of things do not work across the entire border. That may have its place at some points, and I am sure we have border wall and border fencing in the locations where it is necessary, but in the other locations, we need--in addition to more Border Patrol officers who are paid a living wage--we need the technology and the other assets that can surveil and help with the apprehension of people who are coming across the border at points that are not legal points of entry.  But the point is, today's crisis that faces the people of Central America and drives them to our southern border is driving them to lawful points of entry to seek asylum protection under this Nation's laws, and that is something that they are entitled to.

The only crisis is the constitutional crisis that has been created by the President of the United States by his direct and ill-conceived abuse of power which is noted in the Constitution as a violation of the Constitution.  It is sad that the President has declared a national emergency for the purpose of misappropriating funds from previously designated and important uses to build a wall, uses that would be dealt with in a national emergency in case of war that would then call for the building of direct materials and buildings necessary for troops engaging in war.  The only response to my good friend who has come back from the border and saw people going over the border is to engage more Border Patrol agents and train them to do the job that they are designated to do. We, as Democrats, support that.  Illegal border crossings are at a near 40-year low. Sixty national security personnel, ambassadors, CIA, DNI, and others have indicated that this is wrongheaded. It is wrong.  The President's declaration clearly violates Congress' exclusive power of the purse, and if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, violating our Founder's vision for America. That is unconstitutional.  To quote Thomas Paine in ``Common Sense,'' it says, `` . . . in absolute governments the king is law, so in free countries the law ought to be king.'' This is the abuse, the declaration, and we should vote for the underlying resolution to restore constitutional order."

                "speech":"Let me also indicate that as a member of the Homeland Security Committee, the numbers of Mexicans from Mexico has decreased.  The numbers coming now are what we call OTMs, other than Mexican. They are coming and fleeing bloodshed in countries where they are being threatened with a decapitation of their head.  Mothers are being told that if you stay, we know you are pregnant, you can have the baby, and we will kill you after the birth. These are the stories that those of us who visited the border are hearing over and over again.  If there is a crisis, it is a humanitarian crisis. We, as Democrats, have no problem with funding the resources necessary for the border, including, as indicated, the increase in personnel, technology, and transportation equipment.  I have been to the border when the need for night goggles and other types of equipment were rendered important. Let us do the right thing. Vote on this resolution, and do the constitutional point of restoring order to this government.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of our Constitution and in defense of our republic and urge all members to join me in voting for H.J. Res. 46, which terminates the phony declaration of emergency issued by the President on February 15, 2019.  The reason this resolution is before us today is because of the petulant intransigence of a single person, the current President of the United States.  As a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Homeland Security, I have visited the southern border on numerous occasions in recent weeks and months and can state confidently that there is no national emergency or national security crisis that justifies the President's reckless and unconstitutional decision or compels the Congress to abdicate its responsibilities under Article I to check and balance the Executive Branch.  The President is only pursuing this tactic of declaring a national emergency after realizing that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was absolutely correct when she informed him that he did not have the support in Congress to require the taxpayers to pay for his broken promise that ``Mexico would pay for the wall, 100 percent!''  In fact, according to the latest Marist Poll, the most recent polling data available, Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the President's national emergency declaration by a 61 percent-36 percent margin.  The President's decision is opposed by both men and women in every region of the country, by every income group and education category.  National security experts across the political spectrum are unanimous in their assessment that the situation on the southern border does not constitute a national emergency, an assessment echoed by leading former Republican senators and Members of Congress.  They understand that after failing to convince the American people or Congress to pay for his ineffective, wasteful, and immoral multibillion dollar concrete wall, the President has now embarked on a course of conduct that is deeply corrosive of the constitutional system of checks and balances wisely established by the Framers and which has served this nation and the world so well for nearly 250 years.  Having failed miserably to achieve his objective in the constitutional legislative process, the President is trying a desperate 11th hour end-run around Congress with an unlawful emergency declaration that contravenes the will of the American people and negates the awesome power of the purse vested exclusively in the Congress of the United States.  The Congress will not tolerate this.  Despite being repeatedly admonished and in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the President continues to propagate false information regarding the state of our southern border.  Mr. Speaker, these are the facts.  Net migration from Mexico is now zero or slightly below (more people leaving than coming) because of a growing Mexican economy, an aging population and dropping fertility rates that have led to a dramatic decrease in unauthorized migration from Mexico.  Migrant apprehensions continue to be near an all-time low with only a slight increase from 2017.  The combined 521,090 apprehensions for Border Patrol and Customs agents in fiscal year 2018 were 32,288 apprehensions fewer than the 553,378 apprehensions in 2016.  To put this in perspective, on average, each of the 19,437 Border Patrol agents nationwide apprehended a total of only 19 migrants in 2018, which amounts to fewer than 2 apprehensions per month.  In the last few years, an increased proportion of apprehensions are parents seeking to protect their children from the violence and extreme poverty in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.  But even with more Central Americans arriving to our southern border seeking protection, total apprehension rates are still at their lowest since the 1970s.  The absence of a massive wall on the southern border will not solve the drug smuggling problem because, as all law enforcement experts agree, the major source of drugs coming into the United States are smuggled through legal ports of entry.  The southern border region is home to about 15 million people living in border counties in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.  These communities, which include cities such as San Diego, Douglas, Las Cruces, and El Paso, are among the safest in the country.  Congress has devoted more U.S. taxpayer dollars to immigration enforcement agencies (more than $21 billion now) than all other enforcement agencies combined, including the FBI, DEA, ATF, US Marshals, and Secret Service.  The bulk of this money goes to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), with a budget of $14.4 billion in fiscal year 2018 and more than 59,000 personnel.  CBP is the largest law enforcement agency in the country, and more than 85 percent of the agency's Border Patrol agents (i.e., 16,605 of 19,437) are concentrated on the southern border.  Expanded deployment of the military to the border to include active-duty troops could cost between $200 and $300 million in addition to the estimated $182 million for the earlier deployment by the President of National Guard to the border.  Mr. Speaker, having been soundly defeated legislatively by Congress, a co-equal branch of government, the President wants to finance border wall vanity project by diverting funds that the Congress has appropriated for disaster recovery and military construction.  The funds the President wants to steal were appropriated by Congress to help Americans devastated by natural disasters, like Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, or for other purposes like military construction.  Congress did not, has not, and will not, approve of any diversion of these funds to construct a border wall that the President repeatedly and derisively boasted that Mexico would pay for.  In fact, the President has admitted he ``didn't have to do this,'' but has opted to do so because ``I want to see it built faster.''  Mr. Speaker, just yesterday a bipartisan group of nearly 60 national security officials including former secretaries of state, defense secretaries, CIA directors, and ambassadors to the UN issued a statement declaring that ``there is no factual basis'' justifying the President's emergency declaration.  Instead of protecting our national security, the President's declaration makes America less safe.  The President is stealing billions from high-priority military construction projects that ensure our troops have the essential training, readiness and quality of life necessary to keep the American people safe, directly undermining America's national security.  The President's declaration clearly violates the Congress's exclusive power of the purse, and, if unchecked, would fundamentally alter the balance of powers, violating our Founders' vision for America.  Opposing the President's reckless and anti-American decision transcends partisan politics and partisanship; it is about patriotism, constitutional fidelity, and putting country first.  That is why nearly two dozen distinguished former Republican Members of Congress are urging Republicans in Congress to vote for H.J.R. 46 and uphold ``the authority of the first branch of government to resist efforts to surrender'' our constitutional powers to an overreaching president.  To quote Thomas Paine's Common Sense: ``In absolute governments, the King is law; so in free countries, the law ought to be King.''  Mr. Speaker, I urge all members to uphold the rule of law and the Constitution, and reject the President's power grab; I urge a resounding Yes vote on H.J. Res. 46."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank him for the eloquent way that he has presented this legislation to the floor of the House.  Mr. Speaker, I rise to quote from the Constitution of the United States. It begins with our statement of purpose of the Nation, with the preamble. ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.'' Immediately following that sacred purpose, it says: Article I, the legislative branch.  Perhaps it is time for our country to have a values-based civics lesson. I applaud our colleague, Congressman Castro, for his leadership in ensuring that this House was ready to reassert our responsibility under the Constitution and its systems of checks and balance.  In their wisdom, our Founders rejected the idea of a monarch. They didn't want to live under that. They made that clear. They fought a War of Independence to free themselves from that. Therefore, in their wisdom, they put forth in this Constitution a heart, soul, and core of it: the separation of powers, coequal branches of government to be a check and balance on each other.  They saw the wisdom of that and then, of course, added the Bill of Rights with further freedoms enumerated. But the core of the Constitution is the separation of power.  Today, we are on this floor of the House, and our colleagues have spoken eloquently about the reality or mythology of the crisis at the border that the President contends. They have spoken eloquently about the opportunity cost of the money that the President wants to use for this ill-conceived wall and what it means to our national security.  But we in this House of Representatives, each one of us, and everyone in public service in our country, takes an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. It is our oath. We promise.  That Constitution is about the separation of powers that is being usurped by the executive branch. We in the legislative branch cannot let that happen.  In fact, I appeal to our Republican colleagues because I do believe and trust that they are people of their word, and if they take an oath to uphold the Constitution, they will honor it with their vote on the floor today, in keeping, by the way, with, under the previous House Speaker, our colleagues across the aisle placed a high priority on the separation of powers and Congress' constitutional prerogatives.  The Republican A Better Way agenda, which they put forth in 2014, read as follows: ``The people granted Congress the power to write laws, raise revenues, and spend and borrow money on behalf of the United States. There is no power more consequential. . . . Yet for decades, Congress has let this power atrophy, thereby depriving the people of their voice.''  Their Better Way goes on to say: ``The Founders insisted on a separation of powers to protect our constitutional liberties.''  Their proposal goes on to say that James Madison ``warned that the Constitution is a `mere parchment barrier' unless each branch asserted its powers to keep the others in check.''  That is all in the Republican agenda for A Better Way of 2014, so you would think it would be in keeping with their vote today.  In that spirit, then-Speaker Ryan often lamented that Congress ``keeps forfeiting the game, yielding to the executive branch, giving the President a blank check, not even bothering to read the fine print in some cases.''  We are not going to give any President, Democratic or Republican, a blank check to shred the Constitution of the United States. We would be delinquent in our duties as Members of Congress if we did not overturn what the President is proposing. He is asking each and every one of us to turn our backs on the oath of office that we took to the Constitution of the United States.  I do not believe that the Republicans want to do that. I don't think it is consistent with what they had advocated in the near term and historically.  Is your oath of office to Donald Trump, or is your oath of office to the Constitution of the United States? You cannot let him undermine the strength of your pledge to protect and defend the Constitution.  Again, our colleagues have talked about the opportunity cost of taking money from our national security and spending it in this way.  I was at the border this weekend. We all have our stories and the rest, but whatever you think about the wall, let's just put that aside for the moment. Whatever you think about where you take the money from and where you put it, which is substantial, put that aside for the moment. The question is: What do you think about yourself, your Congress, your conscience, and your oath of office? I trust that our colleagues will be consistent in their beliefs and join us in honoring the oath we all take to support.  The resolution is not about politics. It is not about partisanship. It is about patriotism. It is about the Constitution of the United States, which I hold in my hand here. George Washington on the cover of this says: ``Its only keepers, the people.''  We in the people's House are the keepers of this Constitution. We in the Congress are the keepers of this Constitution. We in this Congress are in Article I, the Congress of the United States, spelled out very clearly in the Constitution that the powers given to the legislative branch are the power of the purse, the power to declare war, powers enumerated very carefully by our Founders.  How can you ignore that? I urge strong bipartisan support of this vital resolution to honor our oath to bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote."

Yet we can't do something to protect our border.  That is not a crisis, Mr. Speaker. This is a crisis. What we are talking about today is a crisis.  President Obama agreed when he requested emergency funding in 2014 to deal with the crisis on the border, when he declared a national emergency because of transnational drug traffickers.  Since fiscal year 2012, Customs and Border Patrol has seized 4 million pounds of drugs at ports of entry and more than 11 million pounds of drugs between ports of entry. And nearly three times as many drugs are seized between ports, Mr. Speaker.  Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize the need for a border wall, voting to authorize a wall in 2016 and again under President Obama in 2013. Last year, we passed bipartisan legislation to address the growing impacts of opioids in our communities, drugs that continue to flow into our country through our southern border. We all agreed, on a bipartisan basis, that there was a crisis, but now, suddenly, they are calling this a manufactured crisis.  The National Emergencies Act is clear, Mr. Speaker. The President's authority is clear. The President is acting within the authority that Congress has given him.

I was detained due to severe weather and cancelled flights in Oregon.  While there is no doubt that our immigration system is broken, the president's wall and his proposed funding level is an irresponsible waste of taxpayer funds for a structure that would be ineffective and do very little for our national security. The emergency declaration is nothing more than a power grab by the president to fulfill a campaign promise, violating existing law and our constitutional system of separation of powers.  Congress has already rejected the president's proposed border wall, and alternatively, by an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote, made robust investments in our border security. These investments include $1.375 billion for approximately 55 miles of physical barrier along the southern border, $564 million for imaging equipment at our ports of entry, $100 million for new, additional border security technology, serious investments in the Alternative to Detention program to provide relief to over-crowded detention facilities, and additional funding for attorneys and courtroom expansion to assist with our country's growing immigration court system backlog.  Despite these important investments, the president has proposed taking more than $6.7 billion to build his wall, including $3.6 billion from the Department of Defense's (DoD) high-priority military construction projects. These funds are meant to support much-needed improvements on military bases around the world, and misallocating these funds could undermine the training, readiness, and quality of life for our men and women in the Armed Forces. He has also proposed stripping $2.5 billion from the DoD's drug interdiction program, which could have serious impacts on our ability to combat the flow of illegal narcotics.  Furthermore, the Military Construction Codification Act only authorizes the Secretary of Defense to reallocate funds for construction projects during a national emergency if the project is ``necessary to support'' a ``use of the armed forces.'' Our Armed Forces are not responsible for enforcing our immigration laws and using these funds in this way is in direct violation of existing law.  Of serious additional legal concern is the fact that the administration would need to seize significant amounts of property not owned by the federal government in order to build a wall. Currently, more than two thirds of border property is owned by private parties or the relevant states. In 1952, the Supreme Court held in Youngstown Sheet and Tube that President Truman's declaration of national emergency, even in the midst of an international armed conflict, did not permit him to unilaterally seize private property.  In recent days, more than two dozen former Republican lawmakers and almost 60 former senior national security officials have come out in opposition to President Trump's national emergency declaration. These individuals are united behind the idea that allowing the president to ``ignore Congress'' will deprive the American people ``of the protections of true representative government.''  The bottom line is that the president's national emergency declaration is an abuse of his constitutional authority and an affront to the separation of powers. Congress has the exclusive power of the purse, and the Constitution specifically prohibits the president from spending money that has not been appropriated. Congress entrusted the president with authority to reallocate funds during unforeseen and urgent situations, such as wars and natural disasters. By declaring an emergency when Congress has overwhelmingly rejected his border wall in favor of compromise legislation, President Trump is creating a dangerous precedent for future political disputes. Congress must reject this presidential overreach and assert its constitutional authority."

I thank the representatives for visiting my Washington, D.C., office and taking the time to discuss their priorities for the year ahead. They shared the need to increase staffing levels at Federal prisons because low personnel numbers can result in a more dangerous working environment.  Today I commend corrections officers at FCI McKean and Loretto and all across our country who help protect our communities and uphold the values of our justice system. Officers face dangerous situations in the workplace every day, but that does not deter them.  Just like our first responders, corrections officers are regularly risking their lives to keep their community members safe. They enforce the rule of law, and they carry out their duties without complaint. Their dedication and sacrifice often goes unnoticed by the public, but we owe them our gratitude.  Madam Speaker, let us always thank them for the important work that they do to keep us safe."

During those horrific events that unfolded, a 12-year-old boy hid in the closet as his mother and father were slaughtered. His name was Charles Cohen, and nearly 70 years later in a school in Parkland, Florida, his own granddaughter, Carly Novell, hid in a closet, just like her grandfather did. Carly is with us today to see how true democracy works.  I will end with Carly's words. She said: ``This pain shouldn't be generational.''  She is right. It shouldn't have happened, and we must do more for our children, for our grandchildren, and for everyone in our communities."

He organized protests against Whites-only admittance at Rocky Springs pool and followed in the footsteps of his father, who helped found the Lancaster NAACP.  Mr. Polite led by example and represented the goodness of our community. He was active in his church and worked to ensure that residents had job opportunities, housing, and overall quality of life.  He served as a Lancaster councilman for 12 years. This month, Black History Month, marks 3 years since he passed away, but the evidence of the change that he fought for is evident in our community.

Carrie devoted so much to ensuring her wisdom never stayed with just her but was shared throughout the disability rights community, the legal world, and our Nation. She spoke out strongly and protested each day for the rights of people with disabilities to comprehensive healthcare with dignity and respect.  It is a permanent scar on our Nation that Carrie was lost to the refusal of an insurance company to cover one particular medication, which led to escalating health issues and, eventually, her premature death.  Carrie's activism knew only the bounds of freedom and of justice. She was ceaselessly bold, brave, and selfless.

Res. 149, a resolution recognizing the national debt as a threat to our national security.  In February 2000, the total national debt, including intragovernmental holdings, was $5.7 trillion. Federal spending as a percentage of gross domestic product was 17.5 percent. Today, the total national debt now exceeds $22 trillion.  The last balanced budget was signed into law in 1997, and the Congressional Budget Office projects that Federal spending as a percentage of GDP is projected to be 20.8 percent this year. In February 2018, Congress passed a budget agreement that busted the previously established spending caps by almost $300 billion over 2 years.  All those numbers don't mean anything to the American people tuning in to C-SPAN right now. They are giant numbers. They are really difficult for people to understand and comprehend. But we are talking about the future of our Nation and what we are leaving to our children.  We are leaving them with an economy that is anchored by $22 trillion in debt that is going to turn to $25, $30 and $40 trillion because, this year alone, we are going to have a trillion-dollar deficit, with no end in sight.  We are making it to where our children can't comprehend what freedom is like in this country and what opportunity is like in this country because they are going to have an economy that is weighted down by this body's and the Senate's irresponsibility.  Nobody in America balances their budgets at home like this. I assure my friend from Arizona, our States don't balance their budgets like this. Nobody looks at the total number for income you have, then blows it by 25 or 30 percent, and then goes to the bank and wonders why they might not give you a loan or help you finance a car.  My concern is that we are allowing this to happen on the backs of our men and women in uniform. We are saying that, as a need to defend the United States of America and to spend money--which our men and women in uniform deserve to have the resources necessary as we ask them to go around the globe--we are using that as an excuse to continue to bust caps and to bust the limits that we put in place to hold us in check.  Of that $300 billion that I was talking about the last 2 years, about 40 percent of that is nondefense discretionary that rode on the back of what we are trying to do to help our men and women in uniform have the tools they need.  There used to be an adage of guns and butter. We don't have a choice anymore about choosing between guns and butter. Have we cut butter at all while we go and increase money for the guns for our men and women in uniform? Have we even held it in check? No.  We have plussed it up and continued to bust the caps, all while we know mandatory spending--spending on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security--all go up.  The question I would ask is: When are we going to stop? Is it going to take placing a debt clock over the chair of the Speaker? Do we need to have something to remind us, sitting here in the body, what we are going to be leaving to our children? Because it is our responsibility, what we leave behind to our kids.  It is irresponsible when we look at every bill, every one of these little bills that comes across our desk.  People say, well, why did you vote ``no,'' Mr. Roy? Well, it was just another $500,000. It was just another $5 million.  That is not how you spend at home. It is time that this body gets serious about spending restraint. It is time that this body recognize--as I am very happy that my friend from Arizona has, and I am proud to join him in saying that this is an impact on our national security and a threat to our national security.  When we know right now that the interest on our debt is pretty soon going to eclipse the amount of spending we are spending at the Department of Defense, that is a threat to our national security. We can't sustain it.  When we say now that we are going to spend more money for the tools that our men and women need, how are we going to afford to spend on those tools in 2030 or 2040 when we are spending more, literally, on interest than we are on what they need?  I am proud to join my friend to make the case here that this is a threat to our national security. I call on my colleagues to join us, to join this resolution. I call on them to have the same level of resolve to limit spending and to make sure that we pass down the greatest country to our kids that the world has ever known."

This is something every American should be aware of.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words. Every American should look at a few pictures about our national debt.  This first picture is a 110-year period going from 1930, before World War II, to 2050, just 30 years away. It shows what our national debt has looked like as a percent of our economy, and it is pretty striking.  For the first 90 years of it, there is one huge peak: World War II, a world at war. At that time, our debt exceeded the size of our gross domestic product, the size of everything produced in the United States. Our debt rose to that amount after World War II.  The Greatest Generation spent the next 30 years paying down our debt and growing our economy, so that we had an affordable debt.  We had a little bit of rise in the 1980s and 1990s, as we defeated communism--again, a war situation.  Then, following 2008 and following the last administration, we have skyrocketing debt once again to the point where, within 5 years, we will approach the debt we had during World War II, fighting the largest war this world has fought.  Then, by 2048, 30 years from now, actually having a debt that is 150 percent of everything we make in this country, that is the level we see with failing economies, some of the economies like Greece, Italy, the ones that have unsustainable debts. We are on a clear path to that.  Now, let's talk about the size of our national debt. This chart goes from 2010. This is just 18 years, starting from 2010 and going to 2028. This is the interest payment on our national debt because, Madam Speaker, like every American knows, if you borrow money, you have to pay interest on it. The fact of the matter is that right now, our interest, total interest payment, is about $200 billion.  But, Madam Speaker, every American family knows, every senior who has saved for retirement knows that interest rates right now are very low. If you go and get a CD, what are you getting, a 1 percent, 2 percent return. Those interest rates will return to normal.  And as the gentleman from Texas mentioned, we are accruing debt at $1 trillion a year, so that by the time we reach 2028, the interest payment on our debt alone, due to the increased size of our debt and the increased interest rate is going to approach $1 trillion a year.  Now, what does that mean?  Well, Madam Speaker, there are a lot of things that the government funds. Those of you who are interested in the safety of Social Security, of Medicare and Medicaid, of Federal pensions, they know that we are approaching a zero sum game. We can't keep this debt going forever.  In fact, this final chart I am going to show is 10 years, starting now, it shows the percent spending of GDP, so relative to our economy, what our net interest on our debt is; and then other things, like Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program, things that we think are important, defense. The yellow line, the defense budget, nondefense, discretionary spending, all these are relatively constant. All of them are going to be crowded out by net interest on the debt.  Madam Speaker, Americans understand, you can't borrow forever. You can't do it on your cars; you can't do it on your houses; you can't do it on your credit cards; and we can't do it here in Congress anymore. This threatens our security, when, in 5 years, we will pay more interest on our national debt than we pay defending this country. We can't do it.  Congress has to get its act together, clean up its act, and get our budget in balance."

Think about that. Think about where we are headed because of our profligate ways.  In the first chart he showed, I was struck, as I remembered growing up in the Cold War era.  Madam Speaker, I think those of us who grew up in the Cold War era remember that contest between us and the former Soviet Union and the amount of money spent by both sides. It is dwarfed by the spending that we are embarking on today as a percent of our GDP. That is where we are. That is where we have come.

Madam Speaker, I am distressed by the lack of numbers in the Chamber right now because this truly is the greatest threat to the security of this Nation that we face.  When I ran for office last fall, I promised the citizens of Virginia's Sixth Congressional District that I would reintroduce 4 words to Washington: ``We can't afford it.'' These are four words that have been needed to have been repeated over the last 22 years, as the last time a Federal budget with a surplus was signed into law was 1997.  In Virginia, where I served in the House of Delegates until last year, we are required to balance our budget each year. And because we have placed a priority on fiscal responsibility, Virginia is frequently listed among the best states in which to do business.  In contrast, the Federal Government has an outstanding public debt of more than $22 trillion. Every year, since 1997, Congress has failed to maintain a fiscally responsible budget and, instead, has relied too much on raising the debt ceiling.  Because of this practice, on August 5, 2011, the credit rating of the United States was reduced by Standard & Poor's from AAA to AA+, and has remained at that level ever since.  Virginia, through its fiscal responsibility, has maintained its AAA bond rating, one of only a few States to have that honor.  Not only is the current practice of not passing a balanced budget fiscally irresponsible, it poses a threat to our national security. As part of his National Security Strategy, President Trump has highlighted the need to reduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility, and I commend him for it.  In September 2011, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Michael Mullen warned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our national security is debt.'' And at that time, our national debt was close to $15 trillion. Now, almost 10 years later, our national debt has increased by $7 trillion, a 46 percent increase.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand with Congressman Biggs, my fellow cosponsors, and a bipartisan group of national security leaders, in support of this resolution:  Recognizing that the national debt is, indeed, a threat to the national security of the United States;  Recognizing that deficits are unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous; and  Committing Congress to restoring regular order in the appropriations process and addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States. The future of our great republic depends on it."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Cline), for his comments and his efforts and his willingness to stand on this important issue and recognizing--and promising to people and responding to that promise; because I can tell you, when I first considered even running for Congress, one of the things that motivated me was this horrific debt, which I have watched explode even more since I got here; not because I am here, but in spite of my efforts.  So, today, we are preparing to introduce our resolution, which will be later this week, Senator Perdue, his cosponsors, my 50 original cosponsors--more than 50 original cosponsors. And we recognize that, as of today, the national debt is more than $22 trillion. You have heard that. Can you hear it enough without taking action?  The resulting total interest expense for the fiscal year 2019 is $192 billion. $192 billion. Interest does not sleep. It doesn't take a holiday; it doesn't take a vacation. Interest accumulates without ceasing until you pay your debt.  Our national debt as a percentage of GDP is 104 percent. The last time a Federal budget was balanced and was signed was 1997.  Our total Federal tax receipts for fiscal year 2018 were $3.329 trillion. But somehow--and we all know how--our Federal outlays totaled $4.1 trillion, with a deficit of $780 billion. And we know how. We know how that happened. We look to each other in this body.  Since the last time Congress balanced the Federal budget in 1997, Congress has failed to maintain a fiscally-responsible budget and has relied on raising the debt ceiling. How many times have we raised the debt ceiling? It is almost more than you can count.  Congress failed to pass a balanced budget for fiscal year 2019 and failed to restore regular order to the legislative process by not allowing Representatives to offer and debate amendments. When we have regular order, it permits the House to separately debate and adopt all appropriation bills in a timely fashion and facilitates congressional oversight on Federal spending.  Estimates are Medicare will run out of money in 2026, Social Security in 2034.  As my friend from Virginia, Mr. Cline, said: Congress' ineffectiveness has caused the U.S. credit rating from Standard & Poor's to drop from AAA to AA+. Without a targeted effort to balance the Federal budget, our credit will surely continue to fall.  President Trump's National Security Strategy highlights the need to reduce the national debt through fiscal responsibility.  Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis warned that: ``Any nation that can't keep its fiscal house in order eventually cannot maintain its military power.''  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats warned that: ``Our continued plunge into debt is unsustainable and represents a dire future threat to our economy and to our national security.''  Former Secretaries of Defense Leon Panetta, Ash Carter, and Chuck Hagel warned: ``Increase in the debt will, in the absence of a comprehensive budget that addresses both entitlements and revenues, force even deeper reductions in our national security capabilities.''  And former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen warned: ``I believe the single biggest threat to our national security is debt.''  And so what must the House do?  First, we have to recognize that the national debt is, indeed, a threat to our national security. We must realize that deficits are unsustainable, irresponsible, and dangerous. We must restore regular order in the appropriations process, and we must commit to addressing the fiscal crisis faced by the United States.  I mentioned it before, but when you are spending a pot of money and you have limited resources, regardless of how great those resources are--I mean, we have had record tax revenue for the last 14 months, record revenue, more than any time in the history of the United States of America, and we still outspend that revenue. As we do so, we have to borrow money, because we have created a structural deficit. So, foundationally, we put ourselves in a position where we have to borrow money; and when you have to borrow money, you have to pay interest. As you have to borrow more money, which we do, you are going to start crowding out what you can spend those limited resources on.  Who holds our debt? One of the biggest holders of our debt is also one of our greatest potential adversaries, and that is China. China has been, for the last 25 years, expanding their military, building a blue-water navy, expanding their capacity for rockets and missiles, and also taking in our debt.  This places us at risk if we are ever in a conflict, which I pray we never are. I hope we never are. But if we are in a conflict with an adversary who holds significant amounts of our national debt, we are at risk. And you have to acknowledge that.  What has helped us out so far is the fact that the U.S. dollar is the international medium of exchange in international transactions, economic transactions. If we were to lose that, the ability to borrow funds to sustain our unsustainable spending would go away. And I bring that back to China.  China has ambitions to make its own currency a regional currency of exchange. They would like to replace the United States dollar as the international medium of exchange as well.  What else is an actual physical problem when you have the kind of debt and deficit spending that we have is that you cannot pay to replace and maintain your internal infrastructure, and we see that today. Bridges, roads, airports, all of these need maintenance. They need upkeep. They need expansion. We need new roads. We need new highways, but we can't pay for it, because we are going to be in a position of being overextended. That places us at risk, because you do need internal infrastructure.  Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho)."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague, Mr. Biggs from Arizona, for yielding. This is such an important topic that we are talking about, national debt.  I remember when I came to Congress in 2013, Admiral Mullen said that the biggest threat to America is our national debt. Hillary Clinton, Secretary of State at the time, said she agreed with that. One of the few times I have agreed with Mrs. Clinton.  But national debt today is $22 trillion. When I came into Congress, it was $14.5 trillion. When President Reagan left office, it was about $2.5 trillion. It doesn't matter who is in the White House. Our debt is going up until this body, Congress, addresses our debt.  If you do a pie chart of our debt, 71 percent of our debt is mandatory spending, 29 percent is discretionary. Discretionary was described to me as the money we have left over at the end of the month after we pay all of our bills. That is discretionary.  The interesting thing is, in 1964, those numbers were reversed. Mandatory spending was 29 percent, discretionary was 71 percent. So we were a cash-rich Nation. We could do things. We could do a space program. We could do the infrastructure bills that we did that this Nation needed.  Today, that is flipped around to where 71 percent of every dollar this government takes in is already spent. We don't vote on that in Congress. Those are things that happen without us. The only things we vote and we shut the government down on is that 29 percent.  If we do not address our mandatory spending, mandatory spending will address us as a Nation.  I was on an interview, and they said, well, President Obama doesn't want to mess with mandatory spending, which is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on our debt, retirement programs for our Federal employees. And I reminded the interviewer, and they said this about President Trump: He doesn't want to deal with mandatory spending.  I said: I understand that. But either this President or the next President deals with mandatory spending or mandatory spending will dictate to this Nation what we have to cut, and those are called austerity measures.  All you have to do is look at Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, Greece, where they had mandatory austerity measures where programs were cut, and they were cut by other governments that controlled their debt.  Today, about 30 percent of our debt is controlled by foreign nations, the other 70 percent, the American taxpayer owns, but it would be tragic to allow us in this body to allow another nation to say: You have got to get rid of that program.  That is unconscionable. It is irresponsible of us. And if we do not deal with that debt, that debt will deal with us.  Madam Speaker, this is something I appreciate Mr. Biggs standing up and having this Special Order on. This is something we talk about repeatedly in our district. We have town halls on this.  When you look at the discretionary spending, that is the stuff that runs all of government outside of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the retirement programs. That means the Department of Defense. That means the Department of Education, Justice, the Department of Homeland Security. All the research money that goes into our research universities comes out of the discretionary funding of government.  I am telling you, as a Nation, if we do not address this, this Nation will not survive, and history will repeat itself from great countries that have lasted for a period of time. They have always come to a demise, and it was because they haven't paid attention to the things that are the very basic.  Madam Speaker, I appreciate my colleague for bringing this up. This is something that repeatedly--if you look at this Congress, the Democrats have been in charge of the House since January 2 or 3. We don't have a budget. We haven't addressed anything dealing with debt. But they have spent a lot of time dealing with President Trump and trying to remove him from office and finding out reasons why he shouldn't be the President. Madam Speaker, we as Americans need to come together and deal with the debt, and I appreciate the gentleman's efforts."

One of the things that he talked about, Madam Speaker, is that we have got to take care of our processes, our procedures. He is right. It doesn't matter whether it is Republican or Democrat; our processes have been broken.  I can't even begin to tell you. I have been here a little over 2 years. I bet you we have done a dozen and a half short-term spending bills, continuing resolutions. I bet it is that many. It seems to me like that many. I think we did three government shutdowns last year. I don't know when the next one is going to be. It wouldn't surprise me if it was 2 weeks from now, whenever it is. But the reason we do those things is because our budget process fails.  I remember sitting in a meeting and I heard someone say: We have got a 10-year budget plan to balance our budget. And I heard somebody else stand up and say: Well, I have been here 10 years. Ten years ago, I was told we had a 10-year budget plan, so we ought to be up to snuff. We ought to be balanced by now, because it is 10 years since that 10-year budget plan.

And, again, it is up to us, the Members of the House and the Senate, because we control the purse strings. But we have done a terrible job at it, and it goes back to leadership on both sides.  This is something that should not be a partisan issue. This is something that should be an American issue, because America is at stake here. It is not a Republican Party or a Democratic Party. We don't serve a party is what I tell people in my district, and I am sure you do the same thing. I serve a Nation, and that Nation is the greatest Nation on Earth. If we don't get our fiscal house in order, this Nation will not be the Nation it is.  So, again, I don't think it will balance in 10 years. It won't balance in 20 years unless we change the dynamics, and they need to change now."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Madam Speaker, reclaiming my time from the gentleman from Florida, when we look at that and the promises constantly, this is getting to my point: The process needs to get back to regular order. It needs to get back to 12 individual bills--this is what we talked about--12 individual bills that go through a process where there is debate; there are amendments; there is discussion; and there is accountability.  Nothing provides more accountability than bills that have single subjects; nothing provides more transparency than bills that have single subjects; and nothing allows the American people to see what we are doing in Congress like single subjects.  So when you take 12 subjects, which are your budget bills, and you combine 3 or 4 of them into a minibus and 6 or 7 into an omnibus, and you say vote on these things--usually we are given just a short period of time to read those things and analyze them anyway; usually they come in under some closed rule or some highly structured rule--well, you are preventing a couple of things:  Number one, we are not going to get to a balanced budget because, ultimately, what you are also preventing is accountability, because when the American people can see how you voted in a single area on a single issue, they know whether they agree with you or not. They know whether you should be doing that, and they will let you know. They give you the feedback. That is the accountability that we need if we are going to balance this budget over time and correct our course.  Now, there is an economic theory called path dependence. Sometimes it is called increasing returns. Kenneth Arrow wrote a lot about this, and what it boils down to is this: It is an analysis, really, of why decisionmakers make suboptimum decisions and then persist on the course even after they know it is a suboptimum decision.  Well, what typically happens is regimes and institutions are built up. There is feedback, and people will persist on that because they are building up regimes and institutions; and, ultimately, they have propelled themselves so far down, they are what we call locked in. To exit that path, the cost is so high that they don't want to exit that suboptimal path and move to a more optimal path.  But I am here to tell you tonight that as long as we stay on this suboptimal path where we don't have these 12 budget bills, we don't get back to regular order in budgeting, as long as we do CRs and then claim that we have done a normal budgeting path when we have created cromnibus bills or omnibus bills or minibus bills, we are not going to be able to exit the path that we are on.  If we are going to sustain this Nation, we are going to need to exit the path that we are on and move to a more optimal path. That is really what this resolution is about. It is encouraging people from both sides of the aisle. I am not blaming one side or the other. I am just saying that if we are going to get this done, everybody in this House has to look internally. Everybody in this House needs to say: What are we doing with our process? Everybody needs to recognize that if we continue on this path, at some point there is no more path to run down.  We just heard from a series of speakers that the numbers go up and, at some point, you reach a tipping point, and that tipping point says you cannot go forward. I would rather we move over to a suboptimal path now and pay that price, which is typically a short-term, corrective price. In the scheme of things, it may take longer than just a short-term, but we have to move over because, if we don't, our choices are taken away from us.  I will tell you that if we would have gotten on the path 2 years ago, we would have had more choices and more options. Every day we go further down this path, the fewer options we have until the end. Mr. Yoho is correct, and all of my friends who have spoken tonight were correct, and the more than 50 cosponsors here, they are all correct: If we don't do something, it will be imposed upon us.  If it is imposed upon us, we won't have control. We will not be able to handle this in a way where we hurt the fewest people, where we can feather the landing as much as possible, where we can maintain our economic status, where people can still find jobs, and where people can achieve the American Dream that they perceive that they want to achieve. Those things get taken away from us because, ultimately, this country is built on individual freedom and individual accountability.  If we have to take that horrible measure of receiving something like our debts being called in, or we can't find lenders, or the cost of our loans--imagine if the cost of our debt today would just move up a couple of points--imagine what that would look like. If we can't do this of our own volition, we will be subject to someone else's will and the very essence of the American Dream--individual freedom and individual accountability--will go away. And why? Because that accountability will be foisted upon us by coercive forces.  Madam Speaker, I conclude tonight with gratitude to the 50-some-odd men and women who have signed on to this resolution. I implore all in this body to join myself, to join me, to join Senator Perdue and those who have signed on and sponsored a companion resolution in the Senate, and let's make the hard choices today so that we might preserve the freedoms for our children and grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I rise today in opposition of H.R. 1. This bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled attack on the American voting system designed to allow Democrats to keep the majority in the House of Representatives, and I will explain and illustrate.  As a Member of Congress, we have a responsibility to ensure that every American vote is counted and protected, especially because our democratic society relies on participation in the democratic process through free and fair elections. While I support efforts to involve all Americans in our electoral process, I cannot support this unconstitutional legislation.  Madam Speaker, let me lay out for you some of the most absurd provisions in this legislation.  H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections. For the people watching on C-SPAN, if they don't have insomnia, I want them to hear that again. H.R. 1 creates Federal Government subsidized elections through a 6-1 ratio for government matches to small donor contributions for congressional or Presidential campaigns.  For the government to give matches--subsidized elections--that means they are taking money from you to go to candidates, hopefully of your choice, but not necessarily. So the donor contributions for congressional or Presidential campaigns, which means for every $200 an individual donates, the Federal Government will take $1,200 of the American taxpayers' money and distribute it.  Additionally, H.R. 1 removes the checks our current voting system has in place to ensure eligible voters are casting ballots by forcing States to accept online and same-day voter registration. I don't think that has ever happened before, where H.R. 1 removes the checks our current voting system has in place to ensure only eligible voters are casting vote ballots by forcing States to accept online and same-day voter registration with no penalties for ineligible voters.  That means somebody could show up, an individual, and cast multiple ballots or votes, or vote without meeting the current requirements, and they will not be reprimanded. There is no recourse. Who is going to go after somebody after they have already cast their vote and they weren't an eligible voter? Nobody will go after these people, so it can sway elections. That is what H.R. 1 does.  By removing the consequences of illegal voting, this bill is, in turn, encouraging it. It should be doing the opposite. The right and privilege of us as American citizens to vote is something we should all garner and protect as American citizens. And, again, this is not a partisan issue, it is not Democrats or Republicans, this is an American issue, and I think people would be incensed on all parties.  Additionally, this bill allows Federal employees to take 6 days of paid leave to be poll workers. So the American taxpayers are going to pay Federal workers to be poll watchers. This is something that has always been done voluntarily by our precinct captains, both Republican and Democrat, in our districts, where politics is always best locally.  But the Federal Government wants to intervene here and say: No, we are going to give you guys 6 days off. How many people do you think, that are Federal employees, will take 6 days off of paid leave? Probably a lot, wouldn't you expect?  Madam Speaker, we pay our Federal employees to do the job they were hired to do, not to be poll workers for our districts. That is something that the American voting process has done for over 200 years by volunteers that are passionate and care about this country.  In fact, Federal employees already receive paid leave that they can take for any purpose they choose, including being poll workers. Why should the Federal Government pay? And I want to reword that, because it is not the Federal Government paying them. It is the American taxpayers paying money out of their paycheck that goes to the Federal Government that the Federal Government thinks they know better how to spend that money than they do. So why should the Federal Government pay to give them additional leave that can only be used for this purpose?  Madam Speaker, there are just three provisions outlined in this almost 600-page bill, and I would venture most people will not read this when it comes up for a vote. And while I can further elaborate, I will let my colleagues share their thoughts with you.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Biggs)."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague for leading this Special Order.  Madam Speaker, I want to speak to two specific aspects of this.  First of all, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the sweeping unconstitutional attack on the electoral system that it represents. It would federalize our electoral system and usurp the authority of States and their citizens to manage their own elections by imposing unnecessary and unconstitutional restrictions that interfere with their fundamental democratic rights.  H.R. 1 would restrict freedom of speech and undermine Americans' constitutional rights under the First Amendment by increasing the power of the Federal Government to regulate and control political speech.  It would criminalize a vast range of legal activities, increase government censorship, and impose an enormous administrative compliance burden on candidates that would make it harder for everyday Americans to participate in our political system and even run for office.  It would also weaken important safeguards to ensure the integrity of our electoral system and guarantee that every American vote is counted and protected. This could expose future elections to greater risk of cyber manipulation and mass voter fraud.  It could limit the ability of election officials to ensure that only eligible voter votes are counted and cripple the effectiveness of State voter ID laws.  Now, I have to speak to an issue that particularly impacts those of us who live in States that have independent redistricting commissions. I live in Arizona. Many years ago, our voters said: We don't want the legislature designing the congressional districts and the State legislative districts anymore; we want an independent redistricting commission, so they voted for it. So we have a five-member commission: two Republicans, two Democrats, and an Independent. They design the congressional districts.  This bill would take that away from them. It would bring it back to Washington, D.C., after creating an unelected board that would then design these districts for States. Now, I ask you, why would that be better than the independent redistricting commission in Arizona that was approved by the Arizona voters? It doesn't make sense to me, and it doesn't make sense to my constituents, I can tell you that.  We struggle enough. We struggle enough with the independent redistricting commission with Arizona appointees. Imagine if we have no connection to the appointees.  I am also always amazed at people who don't get to Arizona and don't realize the vastness of that State. It is a unique State: 7 million people--5 million of them in one county, one metropolitan area; 1 million in another county; and then another 1 million sprinkled throughout this vast State. That takes local knowledge and it takes local experience to create those districts, there is no doubt about it. The Arizona Constitution is filled with the criterion on how to redistrict in Arizona. This would usurp the Arizona Constitution.  H.R. 1 is fraught with many, many problems. I have just gone through a couple of them for you tonight.  Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for his leadership on this, his fight, and I appreciate him sharing time with me tonight."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Biggs. I appreciate his help.  I have got a top 10 list here--actually, it has turned into a top 11 list--of the 10 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1.  Again, I want to remind you that the Democrats took over at the beginning of the year. We are $22 trillion in debt. And they will say: Well, it is President Trump's fault. Well, we can say: It is President Obama's fault. And they will say: Well, it is President Bush's fault. And it can go all the way back to George Washington, I expect.  But the fact is it is a bipartisan issue that needs to be dealt with. So the top 11 most egregious provisions of H.R. 1: It creates, again, a 6-1 government match to any small donor contribution of $200 or less in a congressional or Presidential campaign, meaning for every $200 the government will match $1,200.  So let's look at the facts. Where does that $1,200 come from? You go to work, you get a paycheck at the end of the week, at the end of the week you notice that you don't get paid your gross pay, you get paid your net pay. The rest of the money comes to the government and the government is going to use that money, when we are $22 trillion in debt, and give out subsidies to support, hopefully, your candidate. This has never happened before in our government, and we are at $22 trillion in debt. It does nothing to solve our national debt. Number two on the list: Creates a new voucher pilot program--a pilot program.  And I have to hand it to the Dems. They love programs that give out moneys and grants, this voucher pilot program that grants eligible voters a $25 voucher of hard-earned taxpayer dollars to donate to any campaign of their choosing.  The Federal Government has no need to do this. Again, they are taking money from people and using it for that which the government is not mandated by our Constitution to do.  Number three: Authorizes an inappropriate use of Federal workers and taxpayer dollars by granting Federal employees 6 days of paid vacation to serve as poll watchers.  I would venture that come election day, the largest majority of Federal employees for 6 days will be poll watchers and not running the government. This is just bad policy.  Number four: Weakens the voting system of the American people by increasing the election system's vulnerability and failing to implement the necessary checks and balances regarding who is registering to vote. H.R. 1 will force States to allow online voter registration, automatic voter registration, and, I think the most dangerous and egregious, same-day voter registration.  So that means I can show up in Florida, my home State, and I can register to vote that day. I can drive to Georgia and register to vote that day. I can go to Alabama, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, and I can possibly vote in every one of those States, because the driving distance, I could make that.  So I could vote in possibly seven or eight States as a single person on the day of voting. Nobody could validate that. Yet the election gets calculated and determined on those kinds of voting, and I don't think that is what anybody wants.  I would hope, regardless of your political affiliation, you would stand up to say this is wrong. We need to make sure these safeguards are in place to protect that one very, I think, sacred, precious right of all voters, of all American citizens, the right to vote.  Number five: Diminishes the process of election day voting by expanding ``no excuse'' absentee voting and allowing for eligible voters to be able to cast their ballot by mail with no additional safeguards to this process.  That means provisional ballots that get sent in, their signature can't be questioned. It doesn't need to be questioned. It doesn't have to be the correct signature, but it will be counted as a vote.  I would think a party that put that in place would be afraid of that, because it really weakens the democratic process we go through as a constitutional republic.  Number six: Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing sworn statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the voter registers online.  Let me read that again.  Disregards State voter identification laws by allowing sworn statements to be used in place of identification and allowing for signature verification, which can be submitted through a photo if the voter registers online.  Now, think about that. I can't get on an airplane without a picture ID. I can't purchase medication, over-the-counter cold medication with phenylephrine in it, without a picture ID, but we are going to allow people to vote without a picture ID just by signing an affidavit saying I am who I say I am. And, again, that won't be verified until after the election.  It has fraud written all over it, and I think it is unconscionable that the Democrats would even consider such a thing on something that we hold so sacred in this Nation, that we brag about and we boast about in the world as being the longest serving democracy in the world using a democratic process in a constitutional republic, that we are going to allow such shoddy type of verification.  Again, it is unconscionable that they would even consider bringing this up.  Number seven: Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations.  Fails to criminalize fraudulent registrations. We have people going to jail because they have lied to the FBI. We have George Papadopoulos who lied to the FBI, and he went to prison for 14 days. But I can lie and not be who I say I am, and I can vote on this Democratic bill, H.R. 1, and I have no recourse against me. There is no consequence for me being a liar.  And I just think a party that wants to have those kinds of policies in place as a whole needs to look in the mirror and say: What are we trying to do?  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration and voting practices as protected under Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution and violates separation of powers by Congress mandating ethics standards for the Supreme Court. H.R. 1 is a constitutional overreach.  Number eight: Impedes States' ability to determine their registration voting practices as protected, as I said, under Article I, Section 4.  Number nine: Violates constitutional rights under the First Amendment by prohibiting any false statements relating to Federal elections, including time, manner, place, qualifications of candidates, or endorsements of candidates enforced by a partisan FEC, which is the Federal Elections Committee.  Number 10: Empowers trial attorneys by establishing private rights of action by allowing candidates to litigate their way to victory.  We saw this in the last Presidential election. We saw this in the last gubernatorial election in my State of Florida. We saw this in the senatorial race in Florida, where people were going to sue, and they didn't have the legality of doing that, but this bill would allow that.  And I think one of the largest grievances for H.R. 1 that all people ought to be upset with is that it mandates voter registration--mandates voter registration. What that means is the Federal Government says you must register to vote.  I agree, we should all register to vote, but can the government mandate you?  We tried this with the Affordable Care Act that the Democrats ran through in a partisan manner in this Chamber, no Republican support, mandated that people had to buy a product even if they didn't want that.  Madam Speaker, that is wrong, and that is why that part got struck down, the individual mandate got struck down, as it should have, because the Federal Government was saying: If you don't do what we say, we are going to fine you.  You know, that sounds like China. China does that. They have their good citizen score, the Orwellian good citizen score that they monitor what you do, and if you don't do it, you don't get the prizes of the Chinese Government. Are we turning into that, mandating voters to register?  Last Congress, I chaired the Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs. And it was amazing because I got to travel to countries around the world that have just started free and open elections in a Western, democratic style. It pains me to see these countries with a new democracy where 95 percent to 98 percent of the people show up.  If you look at Iraq or Afghanistan, they are walking around with the purple finger at risk of their lives, because for once in their life they had an opportunity to vote, to vote for somebody that they wanted in power--a foreign concept to them. Yet in this country, we want to take that away from people.  As we continue on, there are some myths on H.R. 1.  It has been designed to fund, elect, and maintain Democratic majority, and I want the American people to know that. The Democrats introduced this 571-page package of Democratic priorities without allowing for input from Republican Members or going through the standard House Committee.  This is something that they railed against us. All the 6 years I have been in Congress, they have railed against us about no open process, yet they come out with a 571-page package of Democratic priorities without allowing for input from one Republican Member.  H.R. 1 will waste taxpayers' money, federalize the election system, weaken safeguards surrounding voter registration, and violate Americans' constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment.  The estimated cost of this that we got for H.R. 1, because of all the subsidies and the other garbage that is in this, is over $10 billion to the American taxpayers--$10 billion--when we are already at $22 trillion in debt.  I would like to go through a few myths.  Democrats are empowering citizens. That is the myth. The facts are Democrats are using citizens' hard-earned taxpayer dollars to fund their candidates:  Voucher from the government to the campaign: Through this bill, eligible voters would receive a $25 voucher from the Federal Government that they can use to donate to the campaign of their choice, meaning hard-earned taxpayer dollars are going to be going to the government, to their campaign of choice;  Government matching campaign donations in congressional races: Under H.R. 1, the Federal Government will be required to match small contributions under $200 at 6 to 1. Taxpayer dollars will be going to the government to fund candidates;  Government matching campaign donations in Presidential races: Also, under H.R. 1, there is a 6-to-1 government match of small contributions in a Presidential campaign, up to $250 million. A quarter of $1 billion would be going towards the Presidential campaign, and there is no limit to contributions. Another Democrat myth: Democrats are promoting integrity. The facts are Democrats are promoting the interests of Washington, D.C., swamp, not yours:  Federal paid vacations: Federal workers would get a 6-day paid vacation to serve as poll watchers;  16-year-old voters: H.R. 1 will open the door to 16-year-old voters by requiring States to allow them to register and vote;  Free speech violation: Prohibits any false statements related to Federal elections, including time, manner, place, qualifications, candidates, or endorsement.  And I want to go back over this one other myth. Democrats are creating vulnerabilities in the voting system:  Automatic voter registration--automatic voter registration, mandates from the Federal Government, boy, how the Dems like that--requires all States to adopt an automatic voter registration system that would be relying on the Federal Government for records. There would be no criminal punishment for an ineligible voter who is registered in error.  Madam Speaker, as you have heard, my colleagues and I have severe concerns about H.R. 1. While my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are marketing it as a fix to the American voting system, what it really does is degrade the standards we have had in place for over 200 years to protect American voters and the voting process.  As Members in Congress, we have the responsibility to ensure that every American has the right to vote and the access to vote and that that vote is guaranteed and protected. H.R. 1 does not do this, and I encourage my colleagues to consider this implication and not support this bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, many of us really appreciate when you stay here and listen to us because we know a lot of folks out there don't appreciate it. It is sort of a gift of your time to be with us. When we were in the majority, I spent much of my freshman term sitting in that chair.  What we are going to do tonight is this sort of a continuation of a theme. We have already heard tonight, and over the last couple weeks, discussions of debt, discussions of what is happening in Medicare, and, actually, I want to come here behind this microphone and talk about what I believe is a solution. I genuinely believe over the last few years, we have put together at least the backbone of enough math to talk about the reality. But let's first sort of set up the discussion if you haven't watched some of our other floor presentations since the beginning of this session.  Every week, every other week, we try to take a half an hour and walk through our five pillars of what we believe saves us. Understand, in 9 years, 50 percent of all of the noninterest spending that this Congress will do will be to those 65 and over.  Understand, in 9 years, the 74 million baby boomers will actually be in their benefit cycle. They will be 65 and up.  In 9 years, two workers for one retiree. And when you start to look at the future of our debt, understand--and this is hard because so many don't want to hear it, and it is not Republican or Democrat, it is demographics. If you look at our society, we are getting older very fast; our birth rates have substantially collapsed. Family formation, we have some real issues out there.  So what do you do as a society? We have promises that have been made, earned entitlements out there, your Social Security, your Medicare, and you have earned those. That is part of your societal contract with this government, but we don't have the cash to pay over the next 30 years.  How do we get there? I am going to tell you. I am still optimistic there is a path. I see some of these slides and these boards through the eyes of my daughter. I have a 3-year-old daughter. Best little girl ever. We actually have a coffee mug at home that says that.  Doesn't she have the right to live as well as the generations that have gone before her? Doesn't she have the right to have that sort of optimistic opportunity? I actually believe that is not lost in our society. But as you even saw on the floor today, we do political theater here because complex policy is hard. It actually requires math, and Congress is substantially a math-free zone.  So we always start with this chart. Understand, I believe there are five pillars, and you can mix them up any way you want to.  Immigration. How do you design an immigration system in the future that maximizes talent importation to the Nation? Because you need to maximize economic philosophy as soon as possible. That is what the rest of the world has done. Australia, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Canada have moved to talent-based systems because they figured out that there is something elegant about that model.  Now, let's be honest. I don't care what gender you are. I don't care your religion. I don't care your race. I don't care who you cuddle with. I don't care about those things. We care about the talent you bring to our society to maximize economic growth. I actually think it is a much more elegant model than we use today in immigration.  Economic growth. We must hunker down and embrace tax policy, regulatory policy, and trade policy that maximizes economic vitality. The velocity of the size of this economy must continue to grow, and grow at a fairly substantial rate. If you look at the data, 91 percent of the spending increases from this government from 2008 to 2028 are functionally three things: interest, Social Security, and healthcare entitlements.  So we are all going to talk about debt. It is a threat to our society. When we are going to have the honest conversation, it is substantially driven by our demographics and our healthcare costs.  The next one we are going to talk about is labor force participation. We are going to spend time tonight on that. I know it is a dry subject, but this is actually trying to be intellectually honest. This is a moment where if you are going to call our office and say we want solutions, we are working through it. But it is not trite.  My father used to have a saying. We were just talking about it over in the corner. For every complex problem, there is a simple solution that is absolutely wrong. It turns out, complex problems require complex solutions.  We are going to talk tonight about labor force participation. How do we get as many Americans across the board to participate in the economic vitality? It turns out that has an amazing effect; everything from our healthcare costs, to tax collections, to just the economic growth.  The next two, there is a technology revolution about to happen in healthcare. It is also happening in environment. In the next couple of weeks we are going to come here and show some of the amazing technologies that are out there that actually make some of the environmental discussion seem sort of passe when you understand the technology that is on the cusp of rolling out.  Let's talk about healthcare right now. I have come here to the floor over the last couple of weeks and shown things like--we nicknamed it in our office the flu kazoo--something a material science professor has developed; you blow into it, and it instantly tells you if you have a viral infection, and in the backbone, it could automatically order your antivirals. Start thinking about the revolution that would happen in the cost curve of healthcare if we had substantial change in autonomous healthcare.  In the Phoenix area, we have an organization that now, I believe, has seven of these autonomous healthcare clinics where you go in, you sign up on an iPad, you take a picture of your insurance card, your driver's license, you go in and you put your arm in, you pick this up, you shine it in your throat, your ear, and your nose, and the algorithm is able to do amazingly accurate calculations of your health.  Think about that type of technology when it is in your pocket. You have all seen the pocket size, the size of your smartphone that is now an ultrasound. It is completely portable. We must, as a body--and this is at our State legislature, but particularly this body--we must break down these barriers to the technology disruption that could be a revolution in lowering healthcare costs.  You have got to be intellectually honest. The ACA, the Republican alternatives, in much of the discussion, we are not actually having a discussion about lowering healthcare costs. We are having discussions about who gets to pay.  It is time that we embrace and truly draw in the technology that can be that very disruption. We have a running joke in our office: Did you go to Blockbuster Video last weekend? We all live it. It is now time that we understand that our future healthcare costs are an Achilles' heel to this society because of our demographics and just where the costs are going.  There is another part of that. We are going to actually do a floor presentation, probably at the end of the month. There are incredible disrupters coming in the pharmaceutical world. We just had some information and we think, actually by the end of this year, there may be a single shot cure for hemophilia A. That is only about 8,000 of our brothers and sisters in the country, and it is going to be really expensive, but it cures.  What happens as we continue to see these biological, genomic pharmaceuticals rolling out that actually cure? Or the one that we were reading about today, that stabilizes our populations who have ALS?  What does that mean to the cost curve of the 50 percent of healthcare spending that is to the 5 percent of our population that have chronic conditions?  The last one I am going to give you is, it is time to rethink the incentives--and this one will always be tough--in Social Security, in Medicare. How do we encourage an individual to stay in the labor force? Are there things we can do to encourage waiting to take benefits? And these are math. It is just actuarial science.  So today we are going to talk about labor force participation. Isn't that exciting? The first slide I have already mentioned, this is from the CBO report 3 weeks ago, and I was shocked it didn't get much press or discussion in this body because it is math.  But if you look at this chart, what it is trying to say is, in functionally 9 years, half of the spending of this body--if you remove interest--half of the spending will be to those 65 and older.  It is just demographics. We got older as a society. In 9 years it is the end of the baby boomers, because they have moved into being 65 and older.  But if you had seen this chart and then matched it up to where you start to see the debt and spending curves move up, you understand they are in sync: if you care about the debt, if you care about spending, if you care about opportunity in our society, understand the demographic headwinds and what we must do to face that.  So one of the reasons for this slide, and I know these are a little tough to watch, but what I want you to sort of see is this is 2000. At that time, actually over 67 percent of our population was in the labor force. It functionally collapsed after 2008 and never returned.  The blessing is this last year we have had a little bit of a blip. There were these really smart economists who said: Hey, you are never going to get back up to 62, 63 percent of labor force participation. I believe we are now around 61 or 62. We actually need to find a way to get back to that 67 percent of our brothers and sisters all up and down our society being in the labor force, having the honor, the elegance of working.  There were some amazing numbers last December, if you actually broke into what was in those statistics, of the number of organizations, the number of companies that were actually reaching out to the handicapped community and making accommodations and hiring.  There are actually--and we are going to touch on this--some parts of our society are moving into the labor force, particularly in the millennials, and we are seeing parts that are not. Countries like Japan that actually have faced this, are facing it, have actually been trying to design incentives and programs for even those who are older, who are healthy, who are capable, who are desirous to be welcomed to stay or enter back into the labor force.  It is a barbell. We have a problem with part of our younger population, and then, obviously, our older population--which we have so much talent--that are retiring. We are going to have to have an honest incentives discussion design to maintain this labor force philosophy.  If you actually look at what is going on in our society right now, if I had come to you 2 years ago and said: Hey, we are going to see all sorts of quartiles in our society have some of the lowest unemployment in modern history, I think I would have just gotten blank stares. But it is happening. And with that incredible, almost full-employment society, we are actually seeing--and particularly in markets like Arizona--we are actually now seeing wages really starting to move. This is wonderful. This is something we needed, functionally, for a decade or two.  We can do a much more complicated discussion of some of the incentives that were built in the tax reform last year that encouraged investment in plant and equipment to push up productivity. Productivity allows you to be able to pay people more. But those are the sorts of things you talk about. How do you maintain economic vitality?  When we actually look at some of the unemployment numbers, there is something missing. Understand, when we look at unemployment numbers, we are looking at people who are actively looking, actively searching for employment. We actually have a real problem in parts of millennial males and others, so how do we reach out and design incentives to stay in?  We are also going to go to some of the other tougher questions, and that is: Is it time to rethink things like Social Security disability and say, hey, if you earn $24,000, or you hit this point, you hit a cliff. Your benefits disappear. If you are on other safety-net programs, if you earn a certain amount, you hit a cliff, and it disappears.  We need to have a brutally honest conversation of, is that incentive of that cliff an incentive not to enter the labor force? What would happen if we would work out the math so it was a much more gradual glide slope to draw those individuals into labor participation? Because if we are almost a full-employment society but we still had millions and millions of Americans who are choosing not to participate in the economy and we really need them in our economy, we have got to look to what are the disincentives. It is about time that we actually start to have those social entitlement conversations. I know for both Republicans and Democrats, these are tough because it requires math. It requires us to work through certain ideological folklore. But if you want the wholistic solution to make it through the next 30 years, this labor force participation is one of those five pillars.  The reason I actually did this slide is--this one is a little geeky--but it is actually trying to walk through what has been happening. I am not going to walk through all the detail, but we recently had this wonderful pop of sort of in the population of 25 to 34 females entering the workforce. That was one of the great things that we actually saw last December. Great.  We need to understand why millennial women are entering the workforce in these sorts of numbers, what we learn from that, and what we do now for the millions of millennial males who are still dramatically underrepresented in the economy.  Data shows millennial women dominating the current job market. Look at this separation right here and why this is so important. Remember how I was just saying something has been happening in the last couple quarters where millennial females are entering, but millennial males is the lower line. This is a conceptual problem, but it is real math.  Remember we talked about our barbell? We have those who are older. How do we create incentives to enter and stay in the labor force? How do we reach out to our younger population, get them, incentivize them, and work with them to get them into the labor force? Functionally, we just do not have a choice. Let me grab another slide. We will put these up in our office. Remember, this sort of presentation is for those who really care about digging in to the actual math of policy. So often, what we end up doing on the floor is political theater and folklore.  If you look at some of these lines--and I know this is a long time ago--but if you and I were to step back to 1967 and look at the data for males, we had 97 percent of working-age males in the labor force. Today, if we did that same thing, I think we are at about 88. It falls, 87, 88.  One of the big things that helped us grow the economy is female participation in the economy. But we need to find a way to get this back up. We are just talking a few points, but those few points of a few more million stepping back into the labor market have substantial economic impact.  I want to talk about a story from Arizona. I have had this discussion with a couple of my Democratic friends. Within that, we have talked about incarceration rates and some of the other things that end up becoming impairments for young males to be in the labor force.  In Arizona right now, we have such a shortage of skilled trades--electricians and carpenters--that a number of the businesses in Arizona--actually, I approached our Governor, Governor Ducey, and said: Help us. We are willing to take our own money and go into Arizona correctional facilities and do a training program that is, when someone is going to be on parole in just a few months, we will train them, and we will guarantee that we will hire them. It doesn't mean a guarantee that they will keep them.  So last year, we brought this young man out from Arizona. We brought him to the Ways and Means Committee. He sat down in this beautiful room. The Ways and Means Committee room, it is just very big and very ornate. He didn't look like our typical witness, with a number of piercings and a number of tattoos around the neck. He looked up when it was his turn to tell his story, and he hesitated for a moment and started with: I am a three-time convicted felon.  He went on to tell his story of how he was an addict and the other times he had gotten out of prison, he had relapsed. He had lost his family. He had lost everything. He had lost contact with his child.  He was a few months from his opportunity to go on probation and leave the correctional facility, and he saw this flyer that said: We are doing training for electricians. We guarantee we will hire you--it doesn't mean we are going to keep you--if you pass this very basic course.  He said: Why not?  He took this electrician course while in prison, while it was paid for by private industry because the job market is so tight they are willing to take risks on all sorts of populations to get them back into the work environment.  He graduated. He started at just a little over minimum wage. A year later, he was making, I think, $23-something an hour. He said he hadn't relapsed because he is working too much. He said he is back with his family. He gets to see his child. There are these incredibly human stories.  If we are in a society right now that is almost at full employment for those looking for employment, how do we reach out to those whom our society gave up on or who gave up on themselves? How do we as policymakers design those incentives, design the social entitlement programs, and design our society where we want everyone to have this opportunity within our communities and our society?  It was one of the most touching and amazing hearings, because when you looked at those of us sitting up on the dais, there were actually tears hearing his story and realizing there is hope, that this economic vitality provides opportunity and hope.  We turn it into a political football because it is not our side that wants to get credit, or their side wants to get credit. We need to get beyond that, because if we don't get this math right, my 3-year-old little girl won't have the same type of future I have had.  There is a path to make this work and continue to have an economy, a nation, that grows and provides opportunities. Understand, when the United States grows, the world benefits.  But we have those five pillars. Is this body capable of stepping up and doing things that are complex without a simple solution?  Madam Speaker, I so desperately hope so. With that, I yield back the balance of my time."

On that day in 1942, the President of the United States signed and issued Executive Order 9066, an action which ordered the Secretary of War, ``to prescribe military areas . . . from which any or all persons may be excluded, and with respect to which, the right of any person to enter, remain in, or leave shall be subject to whatever restrictions the Secretary of War or the appropriate Military Commander may impose in his discretion.''  Following this executive order, one of the darkest chapters in American history began as over 120,000 Japanese Americans throughout Washington, Oregon and California were summarily interned in prison camps. Those communities, uprooted until the end of World War II, were forced to abandon their lives as they left behind homes, jobs, friends and loved ones. No due process was granted and throughout the years of imprisonment, no one was charged or even convicted of any action that would have betrayed the country that they called home. Their only ``crime'' was that they were of Japanese descent.  As the Representative of California's 3rd District I am proud to recognize our local Japanese American Citizens League Chapter of Marysville, California. Over the past few days they have taken the opportunity to honor the memory of the hardship that was forced on Japanese Americans by engaging the community-at-large to educate their neighbors on the importance of defending the civil rights that are due every American citizen. I commend their work and aim to carry forward that very message.  Especially at a time when our nation is so divided, it is important to spend this time remembering what happened on that day in 1942 and the dangers that come from ignoring our most basic civil rights guaranteed by the Constitution. I call on my fellow Americans to reflect on what took place during those terrible years and to fight to protect the rights of all Americans, no matter their heritage or race."

She was a selfless community advocate and will always be remembered for her strength and love of family.  Anne was born in Troy, New York before moving to Broward County, Florida as a teenager. After high school, Anne became known for her activism in Sunrise city politics, before retiring far too young after suffering a stroke in 1982. In typical Anne fashion, she fought hard in rehab and recovered to work for local real estate developers in Plantation and Boca Raton. Anne was appreciative of those who helped her in her time of need, so she started volunteering at the Sunrise Rehabilitation Center and became a popular one-on-one volunteer for victims of stroke rehabilitation and brain injuries. She served on the hospital's community advisory board, while also volunteering with Shake-a-Leg, a group for individuals with disabilities who sailed monthly on Biscayne Bay.  Madam Speaker, Anne's commitment to her community is a true testament to the person that she was. Anne will be remembered by the lives that she touched during her 77 years on this earth.

One of the great aspects of serving in Congress is meeting people, and Ed will be one of the individuals I remember most. Over the years, Ed has been a guide, a teacher and a friend to me and my staff.  I first met Ed in the early 2000s when I began working on my Boulder-White Clouds Wilderness bill. I thought it would be important to get a first-hand look at the lands I would be proposing for wilderness designation so I asked the Sawtooth National Forest Supervisor to set up a backpacking trip for my staff and me.  It was my good fortune that Ed was given the assignment to take a Congressman and his staff into the Boulder-White Clouds. I'm not sure that Ed thought the same. He decided we would hike to the foot of Castle Peak in the Chamberlain basin. It was the middle of August--summer mind you--and when we got our tents set up that afternoon it began to snow. It snowed more and blew some and snowed more. When we woke the next day to a winter scene and the chance of even more snow, prudence dictated that it was time to pack up and go home early.  While it was a short trip, it made for a great story and was the first of many enlightening trips and learning experiences into what is now the Cecil D. Andrus-White Clouds Wilderness that Ed took us on.  I also want to give special recognition to Ed for the help and expertise that he provided me and my staff as we developed the Boulder-White Clouds and Jerry Peak wilderness package. As far as I know, there is only one person alive who has been through and over every acre of those mountains and it happens to be Ed.  As we were determining wilderness boundaries, roads, trails, creeks, snowmobile areas and helicopter landing and ski areas, Ed was the one person who could always give me the answers I needed. More importantly, I could always count on Ed to give me both sides of the issue in an impartial manner that was fair to all parties.  He also identified potential conflicts for me with boundaries and uses so that we could resolve problems before they were locked into legislation. I can say with confidence that it would have been very difficult to write the bill without his help and expertise and for that I want to say ``thank you Ed.''  Ed Cannady is one of the good guys and my staff and I are going to miss him. Fortunately, we know he's not really going away and we will keep in touch in the many years to come.  Good luck and enjoy your retirement Ed"

On the evening of January 13, 2019, Juan Salgado was walking to a local market to pick up dinner, but he never made it because while crossing Telephone Road near Red Robin Lane, Juan Salgado was struck by two cars and died at the scene.  Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado was not one to draw attention; rather he kept to himself and worked hard as a landscaper, and sent his extra earnings to his mother in Guerrero, Mexico.  But there is more to the story of this wonderful man.  Three weeks before his death, on December 24, 2018, in the early morning hours of Christmas Eve, a drunk driver collided with a Houston Police Department cruiser that was en route to assist a fellow officer.  Juan Salgado heard the crash from his apartment and ran toward the police vehicle, now in flames.  Juan Salgado fought to free the two officers, John Daily and Alonzo Reid, who were trapped inside, and breaks his right hand when he punched through a window to free Officer Reid.  After freeing both officers and pulling them to safety, Juan Salgado left the scene and returned to his familiar and comfortable state of obscurity.  The day after saving Officers Daily and Reid, Juan Salgado was back at work as a landscaper.  This documented hero was an undocumented immigrant.  But it was not his immigration status that Juan Salgado thought about on that fateful Christmas Eve.  Instead, he saw two human beings who needed assistance and he did not hesitate to offer it knowing the danger it posed to him and his resident status in the United States.  Madam Speaker, Juan Salgado put his community above himself and because of his selflessness Officers Daily and Reid are alive today.  I offer my deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of Juan Salgado as they mourn the loss of this unsung hero."

While District law appears to give the mayor authority to grant clemency (D.C. Code 1-301.76), it is the opinion of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that the president, and not the mayor, has the authority to grant clemency for most offenses prosecuted under D.C. law, particularly felonies prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney in the D.C. Superior Court. Under current practice, clemency petitions for D.C. convictions, like federal convictions, are submitted to the DOJ for the president's consideration.  Whether or not DOJ's view is correct, my bill would remove all doubt that the District, and not the president, has the authority to issue clemency for local offenses. The District, like the states and territories, should have full control of its local criminal justice system, the most basic responsibility of local government. Since the D.C. Council has the authority to enact local laws, District officials are in the best position to grant clemency for local law convictions. My bill would provide clemency authority to the District government and would give D.C. the discretion to establish its own clemency system.  This bill is an important step in establishing further autonomy for the District in its own local affairs. I urge my colleagues to support this measure."

McDermott of the City of Camden, Camden County, located in the First Congressional District of the Great State of New Jersey, for his decades of public service.  Monsignor McDermott was born July 19, 1942 in the City of Camden and attended Saint Joseph's Pro-Cathedral School and later attended Camden Catholic High School.  In 1969, Monsignor McDermott was ordained into the priesthood. He then became the pastor at Saint Joseph Pro-Cathedral for thirty years and went on to serve as Vicar General for the Diocese of Camden.  While ministering to the poor and diverse immigrant community, Monsignor McDermott recognized the needs of the community and assisted in the facilitation of opening several nonprofits including the Joseph Fund.  The Joseph Fund assists other nonprofits with fundraising and obtaining resources, such as; Saint Joseph Carpenter Society, which improves affordable housing, Saint Joseph Child Development Center, LUCY Outreach, supporting youth through after-school tutoring, mentoring and trauma-informed care, Joseph's House of Camden, aids the homeless, offering emergency shelter, supportive housing and social services, as well as the Romero Center, committed to ending poverty and discrimination throughout the world.  In the community he both loved and called home, Monsignor McDermott served with compassion and distinction. The Monsignor was a role model, extraordinary public servant, a tireless advocate for others and will be deeply missed.

Ron was a dedicated public servant and he will be deeply missed.  Throughout his life, Ron worked to improve the community around him. In the first phase of his public service, Ron worked as a California Highway Patrol officer. By the time he retired, Ron had risen to the rank of sergeant. After his career in law enforcement, Ron began what would eventually be a twenty-four-year dedication to the city of Temecula. Ron was first appointed to the Temecula Traffic Commission in 1990, the year after the city incorporated.  In 1992, Ron was elected to the Temecula City Council, where he would ultimately serve five consecutive terms, from 1992 to 2014, including five terms as the city's mayor. The impact of Ron's leadership and hard work is on display today throughout Temecula, particularly in its infrastructure, facilities, parks and libraries. In fact, the city honored Ron by naming its busiest library the Ronald H. Roberts Temecula Public Library. Ron was also rightfully proud of his work granting public use of the Duck Pond at the corner of Ynez and Rancho California roads and revitalizing Old Town Temecula. Extraordinary cities like Temecula don't exist by accident--they come to fruition thanks to the vision and activism of tireless advocates like Ron Roberts.  Ron is survived by his wife, Jeanne; son Ron, Jr. (wife Kara); daughter Wendy (husband Sam); and five grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Roberts family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Ron. Although Ron may be gone, the many contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a lasting impact."

Mr. Moon credits a presentation on bike safety, given to his second-grade class by two Georgia State Patrol troopers, as the catalyst for his desire to work in law enforcement. Ever since, Mr. Moon knew law enforcement was his calling, and he has since served in law enforcement for over 34 years, including 29 years in Oakwood.

In 1891, Second Lieutenant John J. Pershing, then a military instructor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, selected a top-tier group of cadets to ``promote the highest ideals of the military profession,'' among other things, within the Nebraska cadet corps. In 1894, the group was named The Pershing Rifles, in honor of their founder and mentor. Lieutenant Pershing would go on to become Commander of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) in World War I, and remains the only active duty American to be awarded the rank of General of the Armies of the United States.  Since its humble beginnings, the Pershing Rifles have vastly expanded, and now numbers more than 600 ROTC cadet and midshipman members spread across more than 60 campuses nationwide. Now in its 125th year, members remain steadfast in their determination to carry on the organization's original goal of promoting excellence in the military arts.  The mission of the National Society of Pershing Rifles is to aid in the development of successful officers in the Army, Navy and Air Force; foster camaraderie and esprit de corps among all three Reserve Officers' Training Corps programs; further the purposes, traditions, and concepts of the United States Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and give civilians an opportunity to be part of a military organization without formal commitment to the military.  Alumni of the Pershing Rifles have fought with valor and distinction as military and naval officers in every American conflict since the Spanish-American War. Distinguished alumni include former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among many other notable American military, political, professional, and cultural leaders.  Madam Speaker, I am honored to rise and recognize 125 years of service to the nation since the formation of the Pershing Rifles. Throughout their history, they have strived for excellence in all that they do and have clearly lived up to the vision of their founder. I can think of no tribute more fitting, to honor the living legacy of General of the Armies John J. Pershing and his vision for military and civic excellence."

A Mexican businessman, entrepreneur, and philanthropist, Mr. Ayub has enjoyed a distinguished career spanning over three decades. Currently, he serves as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Multimedia and Strategic Alliances of America Movil, Director of Uno TV, and President of the Instituto TELMEX del Deporte.  This year, from February 23rd to March 2nd, citizens on both sides of the Rio Grande will gather to celebrate the 82nd Annual Charro Days Fiesta in Brownsville, Texas and Fiestas Mexicanas in Matamoros, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The events of Charro Days commemorate our shared history, culture and positive cross-border relationship. The Rio Grande binds our city, and there isn't a line or boundary that can eradicate the memories and friendships that have flourished over generations.  Since 1967, as part of the festivities, the Mr. Amigo Association, whose mission is to promote the international friendship and goodwill between the United States of America and the Republic of Mexico, identifies an individual to be Mr. Amigo. The honoree must be a distinguished Mexican citizen, who has contributed to the friendship and understanding between the U.S. and Mexico and has excelled in their profession, exemplifying the highest standards in their professional lives.  Mr. Amigo 2018, Arturo Elias Ayub, hails from Mexico City. Since graduating from Anahuac University with a bachelor's degree in business management and a graduate certificate in senior business management from IPADE Business School in Mexico City, he has contributed significantly to the community in which he lives, making him the perfect candidate for Mr. Amigo. After serving as CEO at Sociedad Comercial Cadena, Ayub held many positions at TELMEX; his work developing critical alliances and partnerships beyond the region contributed to the international growth of TELMEX. However, some of his most notable and impactful contributions have derived from the work he has spearheaded as CEO of TELMEX Telcel Foundation.  In his position as TELMEX Telcel Foundation CEO, Mr. Ayub has brought the resources of the foundation to projects in education, health care, natural disaster relief, human development, and sports. An avid soccer fan, he translated his passion for the sport into efforts to support social justice and increase access to highly-anticipated global sporting events to the Americas. Ganar-Ganar magazine, a specialized publication about corporate social responsibility, selected TELMEX Telcel Foundation as the recipient of the 2013 Social Responsibility and Sustainable Award for their work in organizing the 2012 Homeless World Cup. Additionally, under Ayub's leadership, Claro Sports delivered broadcasting of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi to more than 50 television broadcasters in the Americas.  This year's Mr. Amigo award serves to recognize the positive work Mr. Ayub has contributed to our international relationship. It is also a message of hope as he continues to help our communities, and in doing so, he inspires the next generation of leaders.  Today we honor Arturo Elias Ayub for his dedication to socioeconomic change, business development, and philanthropy. I join Brownsville and Matamoros in welcoming Mr. Ayub to Charro Days."

After graduating from William Penn High School in 1977, Timmons enrolled in college and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard. With a childhood dream of becoming an airplane pilot, her career in flight would begin that very summer on a C-130 airplane in Savanah, Georgia. Despite her love of airplanes, Air Force rules prevented women from flying combat-mission planes, like the C-130. Due to these unfair regulations, she joined the Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn to fly Army helicopters, like the UH-1 Huey.  Undeterred and committed to her dream, Timmons joined the Air Force Reserves where she flew noncombat support missions. She soon realized her dream as federal laws ended the discriminatory prohibition on women flying in combat missions, and during Operation Desert Storm, then-Captain Timmons would become one of the first women to fly in combat. Following that operation, her career would come full circle as she rejoined the Delaware National Guard--flying the same C-130s she first learned to operate.  On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General Timmons would make history by becoming the Delaware Air National Guard's first female commander, and again on February 1, 2017, when she was promoted to the rank of Major General and named Adjunct General of the Delaware National Guard--the Governor's chief military advisor commanding 1,500 soldiers and 1,100 airmen.  During her storied 42-year career, she earned a Bronze Star for her service in Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in the cockpit, including 400 combat hours during contingencies, spanning Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Southern Watch, Joint Guard, Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and Inherent Resolve. She served on the National Guard's Joint Diversity Executive Council and the Air Force Reserve Policy Committee. She has received numerous honors, including induction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame and the Delaware Women's Hall of Fame.  By refusing to compromise on her dream, Timmons broke down barriers, blazed trails, and inspired women to let nothing stand in their way in service to our nation. I join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in thanking Major General Carol Timmons for her over four decades of service to our state and country, and we wish her the very best."

Khojaly, which is located in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, was once home to 7,000 people. That was before Armenian armed forces massacred over 600 unarmed people--including 106 women and 83 children--and left less than 2,000 survivors. Hundreds more became disabled due to their horrific injuries. More than one hundred children lost a parent and 25 children lost both parents. At least 8 families were completely killed.  Even though a ceasefire went into effect over two decades ago, more than 20 percent of Azerbaijan's territory, including Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding districts, remain occupied and more than 1 million Azerbaijanis remain refugees unable to return to their home villages. Ongoing violence along the line of contact surrounding occupied Azerbaijani territory reinforces the urgency of robust American participation in the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group as it works toward a peaceful resolution of the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict.  Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the United States and its allies in security and energy matters. This cooperation has included: playing a leadership role in nonproliferation issues; providing troops to serve shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. forces in Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan; allowing transit of non-lethal equipment used by coalition forces through Azerbaijan to Afghanistan, construction of the Southern Gas Corridor from the Caspian Sea to Italy, thereby providing Europe with an alternative to Russian energy sources; and supplying 40 percent of Israel's oil. Azerbaijan also has a thriving Jewish community and has outstanding relations with Israel.  As Azerbaijanis throughout the world commemorate the massacre and continue to grieve the loss of loved ones, let us commit ourselves to supporting non-violent efforts to resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict."

As Finance Committee chairman, I look forward to helping the President with this important task. I had a chance to be at the White House with several other Senators on that very same issue. I said to the President something like this: You said you put the tariffs on because Mexico and Canada weren't going to negotiate. They have negotiated. Mr. President, you say that you have a good agreement, and I agree that you do have a good agreement. They negotiated in good faith. Then, wouldn't you think that the right thing to do would be to remove the tariffs so we can move ahead?

As Puerto Rico continues to get back on its feet following Hurricane Maria, an especially urgent concern today is funding for the nutrition assistance program. Hundreds of thousands of residents have already felt the impacts of dwindling food aid on the island. Preventing further serious reductions will take prompt Federal action. Even as we speak, communities across the Midwest are still underwater, trying to combat the severe floods that washed away homes and livelihoods.  From coast to coast and beyond, we have Americans rebuilding their communities, their local infrastructure, their livelihoods, and in some cases their own homes. Here in Congress, it is time to finish the good work our colleagues from Georgia have started and pass legislation to provide a helping hand.  I was encouraged last week when 90 Senators took the first step and allowed the full Senate to turn to disaster funding on the floor. Yet it has been unsettling to hear behind the scenes that our Democratic colleagues may now be toying with the idea of opposing Chairman Shelby's comprehensive substitute amendment.  This is no time for our colleagues across the aisle to prioritize a political fight with the President ahead of the urgent needs of communities across our country. Chairman Shelby has carefully assembled a comprehensive proposal that our Democratic friends ought to jump at the chance to support. It ensures that no affected region would be left behind. That includes $600 million to immediately shore up disaster nutrition assistance for the vulnerable people in Puerto Rico.  Unlike the underlying House bill, which does not address this year's disasters, it would provide for a significant downpayment on relief and rebuilding in the flood-damaged Midwest. The House bill has nothing for the Midwest flooding, so it is a nonstarter for that reason and also because the White House has indicated the President would not support that legislation because of policy decisions made by House Democrats.  Chairman Shelby's amendment is the only game in town. It is our only sure path to making a law with anywhere near the urgency these Americans deserve; it is the only bill on the table with any provision for the Midwest flooding; and it is the only bill on the table that could earn a Presidential signature in time to deliver urgent relief on the nutrition assistance needed in Puerto Rico.  In my view, this does not need to be a difficult partisan decision. Indeed, I can hardly put it better than my Democratic colleagues explained it themselves just a few weeks ago. As recently as the end of February, 11 of our Democratic colleagues wrote to all 4 congressional leaders to insist that this subject could not wait. They said: ``Providing desperately needed relief to impacted communities should be a bipartisan, bicameral priority and continued inaction is unacceptable.''  They said Congress had to fund disaster recovery and rebuilding ``immediately.''  Well, this afternoon, our colleagues will have the opportunity to make good on their words and vote to advance Chairman Shelby's legislation. It is our way to help all the affected communities, including the Midwest, which the House bill would simply leave behind.  It is our path to securing hundreds of millions in nutrition aid for Puerto Rico and doing so promptly. It is our shot at exactly the kind of bipartisan action that a number of our Democratic colleagues have actually been clamoring for, so let's vote to advance it later today.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, my Democratic friends from the other side of the aisle often come to me and ask me to cosponsor bills so they will be bipartisan, making it more likely we will get a result. Sometimes they come to me on a difficult issue, and they ask me, in their words, ``to rise above politics'' and support the institution and the Constitution, and often I do that. I think my reputation for that here is pretty secure.  So I have an offer, an invitation I made earlier to my Democratic friends to invite them to join me in rising above politics--it will be a harder vote for them than it will be for me--and help us change the Senate rules in the correct way to restore the Presidential nomination process to the stature that it deserves and work together to try to achieve what we did in 2011, 2012, and 2013.  On March 14, the Democratic leader came to the floor, and he said the following words:       There are times when loyalty to America, to our      Constitution, to our principles, and to what has made this      country great should lead Members to rise above and rise to      the occasion.  He was talking about the vote on the national emergency declaration President Trump made.  The Democratic leader continued:       I hope and I pray that this moment is one of those times      when Members choose country over party and when Members rise      above politics for the sake of fidelity to our constitutional      principles and this great United States of America.  That was the Democratic leader, the Senator from New York.  The next day, 12 of us did just that. We voted for the resolution to overturn the declaration of emergency, or, as I have explained to many of my constituents who have said something to me about it, I voted for the Constitution.  A month or so earlier, we were encouraged by the Democratic leader and our friends on the other side to vote to open the government. It was the same sort of speech, the same opportunity to rise above politics. Six of us did--six of us on this side of the aisle.  In 2011, 2012, and 2013, when Barack Obama was President and Harry Reid was the leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, it occurred to me and others that the Presidential nominating process was in shambles. It was embarrassing to ask distinguished Americans to be nominated for a position and then say ``You are innocent until you are nominated'' or drag things out for a long period of time. It was a bad process.  The President of the United States has 1,200 nominations to make to Federal appointees--1,200 today, but then, it was more like 1,400. One of the most important and perhaps the best known function of the Senate is advice and consent. Our advice and consent to the Presidential nominations is a crucial part of the checks and balances in our constitutional system that was established to keep one part of our government from having too much power. In other words, if the President wants somebody and we don't, that is it. If he does and we confirm, then that person knows us, knows this body, and knows about article I, and when he or she wants money for their Department, they have to come to the Congress elected by the people. That is the Presidential nominating process. That is why it is so important to the Senate and to the people of this country.  So in 2011, 2012, and 2013, Senators Reid, McConnell, Schumer, Barrasso, Levin, McCain, Kyl, Cardin, Collins, Lieberman, and I all, along with some others, worked to change the Senate rules to make it easier for President Obama and his successors to gain confirmation of Presidential nominees. As a Republican Senator during a Democratic administration, I spent dozens of hours on that project to make it easier for that Democratic President, with a Senate majority that was Democratic, to form a government.  We changed the rules the right way. In other words, we followed the rules, and the Senate passed standing orders, with large, bipartisan margins, to do a number of things. We ended secret holds. We removed 163 major positions from the necessity of advice and consent. We removed 3,163 minor positions from advice and consent. We created 272 positions that are Presidential nominations and made them privileged so they could come to the floor and then go on to be voted on if no one objected or required them to go to committee. We made it easier to bring legislation to the floor. We made it easier to go to conference. We simplified the forms you have to fill out if you are a nominee. We did all that in a bipartisan way.  One more thing: By a vote of 78 votes, we decided we would reduce the postcloture debate time for sub-Cabinet members to 8 hours and for district judges to 2 hours. As a practical matter, that means if the majority leader brings up a sub-Cabinet member on Monday, we have to wait an intervening day--that is Tuesday--and then we vote on cutting off debate on Wednesday. And how many more hours do we need to debate it? Then it was 30. Today it is 30. We said: Then let's make it 8 for sub-Cabinet members and 2 for district judges. That expired at the end of President Obama's time because we made it for just one Congress, but that is what we did.  I might add, Republicans did not insist that these new rules should be delayed until after the next Presidential election, when there might be a Republican President. You might say we rose above politics.  I might also add that today some people say: Well, they don't want to vote for anything that might seem to support President Trump because he is not popular in the Democratic primary. I can tell you that in 2013, President Obama was not all that popular in the Republican primary in Tennessee or in any other of the primaries, but we thought it was more important to defend this institution and preserve its traditional and constitutional role of advice and consent.  So, on February 25 of this year, I came to the floor and, in effect, invited my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to rise above politics--the same thing they often say to me. I invited them to work with me, Senator Lankford, and Senator Blunt to speed up the confirmation of Presidential nominees, to rise above partisanship and to rise above politics for the benefit of the institution. It was a pretty easy ask, I might say, because I am basically inviting them to do what 78 of us agreed to do in 2013, which is to reduce the amount of postcloture debate time for sub-Cabinet members and district judges.  I don't think rising above politics ought to be a one-way street. At a time when many complained that the Executive has too much power, the Senate is deliberately weakening itself when we undermine our advice and consent role. What is the result of that?  Well, it diminishes our constitutional role to advise and consent because what happens in the executive branch is it just is loaded up with acting appointees who have never had to go through our confirmation process.  President Trump is probably pretty happy with that. He could just put an acting person in a particular position. That person doesn't have to go through the process and doesn't have to answer a lot of questions. He or she is just there and immediately there. Such as John Ryder, the TVA board member from my State, who doesn't have to answer a lot of questions or such as two district judges from my State--excellent individuals--who waited 10 months to be confirmed or such as the U.S. marshal for the Middle District of Tennessee, who had already been the U.S. marshal before, who had to wait more than 1 year. There was none of that. Just put in an acting person and run the government without regard to the Senate.  As the Democratic leader said to me 2 weeks ago and 6 weeks ago, I would ask him and others to rise above politics for the benefit of this institution and change the rules the right way to speed up the confirmation process.  The Senate Rules Committee gave us the right way. They adopted a resolution in the regular order. Basically, it is the same resolution, with a few differences, that we passed with 78 votes in 2013.  In my February 25 speech, I said to my friends on the other side: If you don't like it in exactly the form it is, please suggest something reasonable back. That is the way we do things. Let's amend it. Let's do it exactly the way we did it before in 2013.  I have been encouraged by some discussion by some Members on the other side of the aisle but nothing certain. The proposal offered by Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford would not reduce the number of hours we debate Supreme Court Justices, wouldn't reduce the number of hours we debate Cabinet members or certain Board nominations, but it would divide the 30 hours of postcloture debate equally between Republicans and Democrats. Basically, it would put the Senate back in the place where the Senate has always been throughout the history of the Senate.  Nominations have been decided by 51 votes--not 60 or 67 but by 51--and they have been decided reasonably promptly. Sometimes they were defeated, but they were decided. The Blunt-Lankford resolution would do just that. Nominations would be decided by 51 votes, and they could be decided reasonably promptly so we would not be diminishing the advice and consent role of the Senate.  Everyone in this body knows what the problem is. One hundred and twenty-eight times the majority leader has had to file a motion to cut off debate--we call that cloture--in order to advance a nomination. Let's say it is for a Tennessee Valley Authority part-time board member. So he will file the motion on Monday. We don't do anything on Tuesday. Nothing would change with that. We vote on cloture on Wednesday--that is 51 votes--and then we have 30 hours of debate. Now it is Thursday. So we could take a whole week dealing with a part-time TVA board member. That has been done 128 times. That was almost never done for previous Presidents.  We are faced with a truly miserable choice. We know this has to change. Our friends on the other side know it has to change. They know if they have a Democratic President in 18 or 20 months, there will be at least one Republican Senator who will do to them what they are doing to President Trump. The Democratic President will not be able to form a government, and so we will further diminish the Senate in its role. So we have a truly miserable choice: either we continue to diminish the constitutional advice and consent role of the Senate--we could do that--or we use what we call the Harry Reid precedent to change the rules of the Senate by a majority vote.  The problem with the Harry Reid precedent is, it doesn't really change the rules. It just says the rules don't mean what they say. It is as if the referee said: Well, the rule book says first down is 10 yards, but I am going to rule that it is 9. It is a Senate precedent, and the majority may do it, but we should avoid that if we possibly can. I don't like the Harry Reid precedent. I believe it presents a truly miserable option, but even more miserable is continuing this debasement of the advice and consent role of the Senate--one I worked to do more about in 2011, 2012, and 2013 with the distinguished Democratic leader, the Republican leader, and so many Senators.  As my friend the Democratic leader, who I see has now come to the floor, said to me and other Republicans 2 weeks ago: ``I understand the politics are difficult--much harder for you than for me--but our nation, our Constitution, the beauty of this government, demands that we rise to the occasion.'' Well, on the declaration of the national emergency on that occasion, 12 of us did; and on reopening the government a few weeks earlier, 6 of us did; and in 2011, 2012, and 2013, 78 of us voted to reduce the postcloture time for sub-Cabinet nominees.  I know it can be a difficult vote in the Democratic caucus, but I earnestly hope that between now and the time we vote this week, that we will not be presented with this truly miserable choice of continuing to debase the advice and consent tradition of the Senate or using the Harry Reid precedent to change the Senate rules by majority vote.  If some of us can rise above partisanship on article I to vote against the declaration of emergency, to vote to reopen the government, and to remove the delay in Presidential nominees when there is a Democratic President and a Democratic leader of the Senate, it is my hope that some of my Democratic friends will agree to do that this week and help us avoid what I have described as a truly miserable choice.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I will be speaking about rules changes in a minute, but I heard my friend from Tennessee when he said we will be faced with a terrible choice.  I would simply say that that choice is being foisted on us by Leader McConnell and none other. You can't brag about passing more judges than ever before and then say the process is broken, and we have to change the rules. There is a total, total--there is a word that begins with ``h'' that I will not quite say. It ends in ``y.'' Madam President, on Puerto Rico, as the Senate takes up the disaster package, I want to implore my friends on the Republican side to remember that Puerto Rico is still recovering from Hurricanes Irma and Maria. From city to countryside, the entire island has been decimated. Yet the administration's response to this catastrophe can be summed up in two words. The administration's response to Puerto Rico can be summed up in two words: cruel and nasty.  The administration has yet to disburse $20 billion in recovery and mitigation funds for Puerto Rico that were already appropriated, and this is more than a year after they were appropriated by Congress. There is $20 billion sitting there as people suffer.  Bureaucracy has similarly delayed crucial rebuilding projects at hospitals and schools and stoked real concerns that the administration is not interested in helping the island rebuild the way Congress intended.  It should hardly bear repeating, but every single American citizen deserves a Congress and a President fully committed to providing every resource necessary to rebuild in the wake of a natural disaster. Our fellow citizens in Puerto Rico are every bit as much American citizens--that is by law--as we are. Yet the President seems to want to treat them differently, cruelly, and nastily.  Now Republican Senators are attempting to strip away recovery funds from Puerto Rico and other territories from the disaster package that passed the House. They have even rejected a Democratic effort to speed up the release of the billions in already allocated funding. Those are no new appropriations. They have already rejected our efforts to speed up the release of the billions in already allocated funding that the Trump administration has locked away in the U.S. Treasury.  Now, because the House passed their disaster bill back in January, it didn't include any aid to assist those affected by the recent devastated flooding in the Midwest, but my friend Senator Leahy is planning to offer an amendment to the House bill that would provide much needed aid to survivors of those recent disasters because they too deserve the aid they need to recover.  They said Emperor Nero fiddled while Rome burned. President Trump tweets while Puerto Rico suffers. I hope my Republican colleagues will join us in supporting this amendment and voting yes on the House bill to support all communities that need to rebuild."

                "speech":"Madam President, on another matter, last week we were reminded of an evergreen truth: The Republican Party is still trying to take away the healthcare of millions of Americans. They are just sick and tired of being blamed for it, even though the blame falls right on their shoulders.  Just this morning, we read that some of my colleagues from across the aisle have begged Attorney General Barr to reverse the administration's wild decision to declare our current healthcare law unconstitutional--a decision that would throw the future of preexisting conditions and healthcare coverage for millions into doubt.  I have a better idea. If Republican colleagues truly oppose this decision, they can work with their leadership and come down and offer some solutions. Stop with the backroom phone calls. Stop waiting for someone else to bail you out. Stop whispering: Oh, President Trump, don't do it and then be afraid to buck him publicly because Americans are depending on their healthcare.  This is a fiasco that Republicans spent years in making as they tried to keep voting on repeal and replace and couldn't come up with a replace. Everyone knows it. It helped shape the elections of 2018. It will be on the minds of voters in 2020.  You know, facts are stubborn things. If the Republican Party is truly sick of getting blamed for standing between Americans and their healthcare, maybe they shouldn't have voted again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Maybe they shouldn't have voted to allow the President to sabotage, piece after piece, the healthcare net we have provided for people.  If our Republican colleagues are sick of blame, maybe they shouldn't have given this administration the green light to sabotage the exchanges and cut funding for programs that help people get covered and protect them from preexisting conditions.  If Republicans are really sick of getting blamed for sabotaging the American healthcare system, then, let me provide some friendly advice from across the aisle: Stop sabotaging the American people's healthcare.  Republicans can try to hide from their record, but the American people aren't fooled. Healthcare has been a defining issue for Republicans for generations. In the same way that the party has sworn fealty to tax cuts for the rich and handicapping the government, the modern Republican Party now swears fidelity to the cause of higher healthcare costs and diminished coverage for tens of millions of American citizens.  Tomorrow Senate Democrats will join our colleagues in the House to take action for ourselves against the Department of Justice's war on healthcare. We will set the record straight on the Republican's effort to steamroll American families who enjoy coverage for the first time thanks to this law. We will make clear that unless Republicans join us in taking action, they will continue to own this mess--and a sorry mess it is--when people's lives and health are at stake and our Republican colleagues do nothing--nothing--but make it worse."

                "speech":"Madam President, on another matter, one of the Senate's core responsibilities is vetting any and all of the President's nominees. Unfortunately, if we have learned anything in the last 2 years, it is that this administration seems far too often willing to put nominees forward to the Senate without performing due diligence and careful background checks.  Just last week, we learned that the President's choice for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors may have serious personal financial issues. That is just the latest in a long line of red flags in the records of Trump nominees. It is clear that we cannot falter in our role as a check on the administration.  So I was bemused this morning to read the Republican leader's case that the Senate needs to speed up President Trump's nominees to an even faster pace. Is this the majority leader's idea of an April fool's joke? Was his op-ed his April fool's joke on the Senate, on bipartisanship, and on America? It is the most ridiculous thing in print since Sidd Finch.  This is the double standard to trump all double standards. It is simply galling--galling--for the Republican leader to say that we aren't moving fast enough. When Barack Obama was President, qualified nominees languished to the detriment of our government. Take the example of Richard Cordray. For no good reason, he waited 729 days, more than 2 years, to be confirmed to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and he was hardly an exception.  Of course, because of Republican obstruction in what the Republican leader called one of his ``proudest moments,'' the Republican-led Senate refused to even consider Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court for nearly a calendar year.  But now, under President Trump, Leader McConnell has sung a different tune. Overnight, he has become a reformer in the cause of Trumpism. Working hand-in-hand with the Federalist Society, the Republican leader became, in the words of his own adviser, the principal enabler of the Trump agenda. At Leader McConnell's command, Republicans ended the blue slip rules for circuit court nominees and even refused to confirm Democratic nominees for bipartisan Boards and Commissions like the SEC and the NLRB. With these moves, the Republican leader has driven a stake further into the heart of comity and bipartisanship in the Senate.  Now, despite openly bragging about the number of Trump judges that he has led the Senate to confirm, Leader McConnell demands that the rules of the Senate be changed to speed up confirmation. On the one hand, there is too much obstruction. On the other, we proved we supported a record amount of judges and gotten them through.  Leader McConnell, you can't have it both ways. You can't have it both ways. Everyone sees through that.  The Senate needs to do its job. We should not be a conveyor belt for President Trump's radical and unqualified judicial nominees. So let's call this for what it is. This rules change is yet another power grab by Leader McConnell, the Republican Party, and its rightwing allies. It is a transparent attempt to further politicize our courts by packing them with President Trump's hard-right, ideological, and too-often unqualified nominees, and we will not be complicit in the Republican leader's games, which sacrifice much of the comity and bipartisanship that this Senate used to represent."

That is why 3 weeks ago Vice Chairman Warner and Ranking Members Feinstein, Menendez, and Reed called for a thorough review of compliance with security clearance policies and procedures. The Trump administration has flouted these rules again and again. The American people deserve some answers.  Where are the leaders of our intelligence community? Where is the inspector general of the intelligence community? Why would our Republican counterparts not let us confirm the Nation's top counterintelligence official? Director Coats and the relevant inspector general must investigate these allegations immediately and take whatever steps are necessary to protect our national security.

                "speech":"Thank you. I appreciate that, I think.  Madam President, I am not going to talk about judges and appointments and things of that nature. I could talk about them. That is a big issue for us coming up. I want to talk about people--American citizens, farmers, ranchers, people who make our food supply happen, people who make our country happen and our economy happen, et cetera.  Georgia is one of a number of States that supposedly had gotten some kind of disaster benefit some time back. We have had hurricanes, floods, and storms. California has had great fires. We had an earthquake in Alaska. We had volcanoes in Hawaii. This has been one of the most devastating years--and the past couple of years now--we have ever had, and, historically, we have always passed disaster bills to help our citizens who are put out of business, basically, by disaster to at least get their feet back under them.  We have helped people get healthcare. We have helped people get housing benefits. We have helped people do a lot of things just to get their families put back together--people like these folks right here.  I just want to remind myself from this picture here that we have the Moss family. We have others who are here who raise cotton, raise peanuts, and raise pecans. Georgia is now No. 1 in the U.S. of pecans. Pecans are a huge cash crop for us. Of course, Savannah, in my State, ships ton after ton all year long.  A pecan is an interesting nut, so to speak, because the tree has a lifecycle of about 12 years before it can make or produce pecans. When you invest in a pecan farmer, you are not investing like in a watermelon farmer. You get a watermelon the first year you plant them. You are investing in something that is going to take 12 years to mature and begin production. We had 50 percent of our pecan crop completely destroyed a few months ago now in southeast Georgia, and you can't reclaim it. It is difficult to finance.  It is an unusual tree, and it is unusual wood because it is not as strong as you would like to have it. Therefore, when it gets really mature and really produces, it produces so much weight on itself. Unless you are really doing a good job, you are going to lose some of them just because of the weight it produces on its own limbs.  Peanuts, everybody knows, because we serve those peanuts back in the cloakroom all the time to curb your appetite--Georgia peanuts. They are all laughing and looking at me. They know how good they are. That helps all of us make it for another day, until we get to another meal.  We do all kinds of things in here about this. Agriculture is 21 percent of my State's economy, but it is all of America's economy--a lot of it. Most importantly, it is what we all have to do--to eat three times a day. There is only 90 days' worth of food supply available at any one given point in time in the world. I mean, as food grows, you consume it, and you replant and you grow again.  We have a number of people from east coast to west and from north of the northern border and west of the west border who are in pineapples or pecans or peanuts or whatever--cotton--and who need some relief that they have earned and need.  What is happening is that we have had multiple attempts in the last 5 months to pass a disaster relief package. It will be offered as an amendment that basically Senator Perdue and I have offered as well in the past. It just takes those people in our country who have been hurt, who are eligible for programs that exist in the law, and gets that money out the door. For some of us, if we don't get it done in the next 2 weeks, it is just not going to get done. We have farmers who will go out of business.  You know, everybody says all farmers are all rich. Well, they are dirt poor. That is what they are. I was a real estate guy. I know how you do that. You make a great balance sheet on the value of the real estate, but all of a sudden, if you lose the value of the real estate and you don't have anything to offset the liability that you created to buy the real estate, you get in trouble. We have a lot of that in Georgia, a lot of it in Alabama, a lot of it in California because of the fire, and a lot of other places.  We need to get it straight, and the best thing we can do is to get these farmers in a position where they know this year, if they get their money in time to plant, they can make the money they need to pay the bank back rather than tell the government to give them a check for a disaster.  So we are not only talking about helping the farmer. We are talking about helping us. Every time we get the farmer back on his or her feet in order to go back into production, planting, and doing their job, then, they will produce income for that, and they will pay these loans off. Yes, they are not going to be as rich as they were before, but they will not be out of business. Some of these farms are 200 years or more in the family--post-Civil War farms. There are lots of people in our State who are just dying because of what happened.  Our cotton crop was killed. It was probably the best. We think it was going to be the best crop we ever had because the week before the storm started hitting, we did some picking, but then the storms came through, and in 1 day, one hurricane wiped out the cotton in Georgia.  It took out about 70 percent of the pecan trees in Georgia. It took out our blueberries--yes, blueberries. Everybody says Michigan produces the most blueberries, or Maine does. No, they don't. Georgia does. Agriculture is an entrepreneurial business in our State, but it takes the ability to raise the money to plant it, produce it, sell it, take the crop to market, and reinvest it. We are not talking about people getting rich. We are talking about people taking the risk of doing business like you have always done business.  So I am going to talk about this amendment for just a second. It is so important. There is some misinformation out there. Leader Schumer obliquely referred to a whole lot of misinformation. I am going to correct one of them that he said in just a minute.  It is important to know what we are doing tomorrow. We are going to tell Renee Moss, Greg Mims, and Casey Cox--these families right here--that help is on the way for their cotton, their pecans, their peanuts, and their farms. It is help not to give them a handout but to give them a hand up and tell their bankers that we are going to stick with them so they can work overtime to make the money back to pay the bank back and also pay us back. That is what we ought to do, and that is what we should do, but if we don't do it before the month is over, we are dead.  As many of you know in here, the SNAP money ends this month. The SNAP money fix is in this. You are not going to have student nutrition programs if you don't get it added into the legislation and get it passed. They run out, technically, on March 31, and we have 14 days until that is passed, which will be April 14, to finally restore it. We have to restore it as fast as we can. We have to get it done. This bill does that.  Let me tell you what the bill does. You heard about Puerto Rico. I love Puerto Rico. When I was in the Air Force, we did field trainings at Ramey Air Force Base. I was a load master. We did runs down there to the east coast all the time. I love the people down there. I love the food down there. I love the beaches down here and the great folks. They have already gotten a number of millions of dollars that they talked about in a speech today. They want $600 million that were now approved in this bill. Now, $600 million is a lot of money.  They already got $40 billion and haven't spent all of that. We need to make sure everybody gets their fair share for the disasters that took place and does not take the disaster money and use it as a payoff somewhere down the line.  Puerto Rico should be helped, but the rest of the country shouldn't be held hostage because of Puerto Rico. We have Florida, Alabama, North Carolina, and South Carolina with hurricane damage, California with the wildfires, Alaska with the earthquake, Hawaii with the volcanoes, and also include $600 million for Puerto Rico. There is no money for CDBG, like some of them wanted, but the rest of the money for the SNAP program. That is what their votes are going to be about.  The Democrats are going to say, just as Mr. Schumer did--he was for this a while back. I don't know what happened. I guess he got upset about something; I don't know what it is. This says we are going to take care of people who had disasters that they didn't want and lost lots of money they couldn't afford to lose. They are going to go out of business, which we don't want them to do. It is going to compound their problems in their States.  I know the Senator from Arkansas, the Presiding Officer, knows exactly what I am talking about. Rice is the main product in Arkansas, as well as other agricultural products. It is key to their economy. So we have to get them safe while we can.  It is about those crops. It is about their insurance. It is also about their economy. I wanted to bring this up. It is about global warming. It is about climate change. It is about a lot of things we don't ever brag about around this place. I am going to brag about it simply because people think these things are about one simple subject.  This is a report out of the Appropriations subcommittee that does a number of things to fix things that are broken, things that people around here talk a lot about wanting to do, things like $20 million for the CDC to continue its research on epidemics, which saved us with Ebola when it hit us a couple of years ago, and it will save us again with measles. We are on the cusp of an outbreak of measles--an outbreak like we have never seen before. It is not there yet, and I don't want somebody to run out and say: He said it is there. But it is coming if we don't react to it or respond to it. It is critical that we do and see to it that we do it as fast as possible.  It is about $600 million for Puerto Rico.  It is about emergency forest restoration programs where our forests have been destroyed by storms.  It is about nutrition assistance for the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, a province of the United States of America where people are starving right now and going into malnutrition.  It is about American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and market facilitation programs for AGI waivers.  It is about the economic development assistance programs that are not working right now because they are not funded, and if we don't get them funded, they are not going to work for the betterment of our economy.  It is about $200 million to repair the damage caused by Hurricane Florence to Marine Corps installations at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune. I think you and I agree that the Marine Corps is very important. You might say, what emergency do they have? They were wiped out by the storm. If we don't rebuild these things as quickly as possible, we will have our marines without a place to bivouac, a place to sleep or a place to eat. We don't want that to happen.  That is what this is about. It is not about giving out perk money; it is about absolute essentials to the defense of our country, the food of our country, et cetera.  So I want to appeal to Senator Schumer. I listened to his remarks. Now, unfortunately, the Senator from Vermont has come. He didn't know I was talking, I guess. I will talk about him a little bit too. Mr. Leahy is a fine gentleman and a great friend of mine, but he has kind of let me down on this one. I want to talk about that. I am hoping maybe I can change his mind and maybe yours as well, Mr. President. We don't have a second chance at this. We had two chances that didn't make it. We voluntarily got off the other bills because we didn't have enough money to get on them, so we had to get something else passed. One of them was restoring the cuts before the shutdown--which, by the way, we got off of the shutdown vote to allow this to pass so we could cut out one of the arguments. I wanted to throw that in as well.  I see he is leaving already. He didn't want to hear what I had to say. He told me--and I will try to phrase this correctly--he told me: I have always voted for emergency money.  I have always voted for emergency money, too, for Yankees, for southerners, westerners, and northerners, because when we have an emergency in this country, it is America's emergency; it is not just an emergency for one region.  We don't want to bleed ourselves to death or wastefully spend this money, but by golly, if we become a country where we cannot depend on ourselves to help ourselves when times are tough--I don't know.  Senator Romney and I talked before this a little bit ago about how we really ought to have a sinking fund and create a funding source that over time can accumulate money as a hedge against future disasters. We know we are going to have them; we always do. We know they are going to come; they always do. At least have more money in the bank to be prepared for them so we don't get into political battles like we are in now where we have tangential issues that we are debating all because of the amendment, et cetera.  So with the senior Senator from Vermont on the floor, I am going to cut some of my remarks short so he will have plenty of time to say whatever he has to say, but I want him to hear what I have to say.  This is about Puerto Rico. They are getting $600 million, and they have already gotten some money. They aren't going to get everything they want, but they are getting everything they should get out of this particular bill, including SNAP.  The farmers in the South are going to get a chance to replant, a chance to borrow, and a chance to make the money to pay back over time. Otherwise, it is going to be on our backs anyway, so if we don't help them, we are going to be stuck. It is about doing the right thing at the right time for the right people. The right thing is to restore the commonsense bills we have passed that will allow them to farm or whatever it is they do. That is No. 1.  No. 2, we need to do it without arguing about regions or people or what they do. We ought to do it as American citizens supporting other American citizens and what they do for their livelihood, and they pay their taxes because of that.  Lastly, there are times when we have great debates over things that are political in nature or funny in nature. I am serious as a heart attack about this. I told Mitch McConnell, who was mentioned by Senator Schumer a minute ago, I told Mitch--I said: I can't go home this weekend and tell them the same thing I told them the last four weekends. I have to tell them we got the job done for them, or we are going to fail them.  I don't want to fail them. I want to vote for the amendment tomorrow that Senator Shelby offered. If it loses, I am going to vote for the one the Democrats will offer, which will give us a chance to get something back in the conference committee. If both of those lose, we may as well go home. We will wake up one day in the next few months and say: What did we do? Why did we do that? We lost our perspective.  It is not just about Georgia; it is about America. It is not just about farming; it is about a lot of things. It is time for us to do what is right, what we should have done on the two bills before--that we approved. Let's make it happen the way we have always done, and let's do the right thing at the right time for the right people, for the citizens of the United States for America.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, while my friend is still here on the floor, he was absolutely correct when he pointed me out as saying that I have long supported disasters, whatever State is involved, whether it is a red State, blue State, or purple State. I believe in helping Americans. We are all part of the United States of America.  I think we do waste time sometimes in having debates on things we should not. For example, when the Republicans controlled the House of Representatives and the Senate and we had a bill to keep our government open and to fund part of the barriers along the Mexican border, both the Senator and I voted the same way. We voted for the bill. It would have given $1.4 billion that the Executive could use toward security. The President threaten to vetoed that, saying it was not enough even though the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats had voted for it in the House and the Senate. So he shut down the government for 35 days, which caused unprecedented hurt to Americans of all political persuasions all over this country. I believe the CBO said it cost the country about $11 billion.  What did he then sign? The new bill we came up with, which had $1.3 billion. He rejected the bill the Republicans and Democrats had supported that had $1.4 billion, shut down the government, ruined the lives of many hundreds of thousands of Americans, cost our economy over $10 billion, and then signed a bill to get $100 million less.  I worry we are in somewhat the same situation now. We seem to be deciding which Americans are going to be helped based on a tweet. I believe all Americans should be helped, and I voted for disaster relief for the States of every Senator who is on the floor presently. I have never asked what their priorities were or what their political background was; if they had a disaster, I voted for it. I think it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to stand with American communities in crisis.  I praised Chairman Shelby and his staff for their efforts to move this process forward. I know communities in Senator Shelby's State recently experienced their own natural disaster. As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, as a U.S. Senator, and as a Vermonter, I am ready to stand with the people of Alabama because that is what we Americans do.  When Tropical Storm Irene devastated my State in 2011, Members of this body came to me not as Republicans or Democrats but as American citizens eager to help their neighbor. When disasters have hit other parts of the country, I have done exactly the same.  But now we should know that for more than 1 year, one of our neighbors has been in crises. In 2017, Puerto Rico was hit by two back-to-back category 5 hurricanes. It is an almost unprecedented disaster--two back-to-back category 5 hurricanes. At first, the administration was saying: Well, there is only a handful of people who died. Well, it turns out that we estimated that 2,975 Americans lost their lives. That is one heck of a handful. Their homes were demolished. Their communities were destroyed. This was more than 1 year ago.  Today, if you fly over Puerto Rico, the landscape will still be specked with blue plastic tarps that serve as temporary roofs and shelters. From the ground, you see that the wear and tear of a year and a half has frayed that plastic. The boards haphazardly holding up these plastic roofs have warped, and they appear ready to collapse.  The New York Times wrote a story on the 1-year anniversary of the storms. The stories told are heartbreaking.  One woman, Martina Cruz Sanchez, described her hurried routine every time it rains. First, she has to climb a ladder to where her roof used to be before 100-plus-mile-an-hour winds ripped it off and scattered it around the island. Then, using a hose, she has to manually siphon off the accumulating puddles to keep the roof from leaking on what little she has left. Ms. Cruz's situation is not unique. On a different part of the island, Pablo Figueroa is forced to live in the only corner of his small home that still has a roof. Two others described living out of a tent attached to their neighbor's garage. A fallen tree remains from where it first crashed through Paula Cruz Ortiz's home. Julia Rivera, a mother of nine, laments that she has ``lost everything'' except her ``faith in God.''  Across the island, water-logged walls have gone unrepaired and have begun to rot. A hospital that was flooded was overtaken by toxic mold--a hospital. A hospital that was flooded was overtaken by toxic mold. A year after the storm, it remained closed.  The mold in 82-year-old Leomida Uniel's home has stained the walls black. This 82-year-old person had a lung infection as a result.  When Carmen Cruz was asked about losing her home, she said: It was a little house--two bedrooms--but for me, it was a castle.  I tell these stories because these are American citizens. I would tell the same story if they were Vermonters or whatever other State they might be from. They are American citizens. These are our neighbors. These are human beings. Let's treat them as such. To do any less is an embarrassment to our country, this body, and our humanity. This was an extraordinary disaster and requires an extraordinary response.  What has happened? Let's be very frank. Let's be very honest about what has happened. Instead of standing with our neighbors, our fellow Americans, the President has chosen to hold petty grudges, which is way beneath the Office of the Presidency. He wants to pick winners and losers by deciding who gets assistance based on his own arbitrary standards. That is wrong. This Senator says that is un-American.  I know firsthand that the Federal Government is a critical partner in the effort to recover and rebuild. North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, California, Texas, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands just to name a few are all counting on us to get this bill across the finish line. I have urged Senate Republicans to take up and pass the House bill, H.R. 268, since the House first passed it in January. The Republican leadership has refused. So they have forced Puerto Rico to begin to cut back nutrition assistance weeks ago.  I am glad to see that the Republican substitute amendment finally includes money for Puerto Rico's nutrition assistance program. We should get that money to the island soon, but nutrition assistance is not enough. Puerto Rico needs to rebuild. I have offered a compromise path forward from what the House passed, but it would address the needs of Puerto Rico. It would unlock billions of dollars in additional assistance for the mainland. Keep in mind that billions of these dollars are just sitting there.  If Senate Republicans would accept this proposal, we could quickly pass this disaster bill. Even though it is different than the House bill, we could pass it in the Senate, and I believe the House would pass it and forego the need for a conference and get assistance to the people who need it sooner rather than later.  I agree with my distinguished colleague and friend that we should do that this week. We could do that today. In a moment--and I alert my colleagues on the other side--I will ask unanimous consent to take up and adopt this amendment, but if the amendment is not adopted, I will vote against the cloture motion on the Republican substitute.  We cannot advance a bill that picks and chooses among Americans and says that some Americans are lesser than others. We cannot advance a bill that does not address these critical needs.  H.R. 268, the underlying House-passed bill, is a good bill. It provides for much needed relief of victims of Hurricane Florence, victims of Hurricane Michael, and the Hawaii volcanoes, and California wildfires, just to name a few of the disasters. It also continues critical assistance to Puerto Rico.  Today I filed an amendment to extend relief to the victims of the recent tornadoes in the Southeast and the flooding in the Midwest. H.R. 268 was drafted before that flooding occurred. My amendment would ensure that they receive assistance, as well.  I am about to ask unanimous consent that this amendment to the House bill be adopted, as well. I believe that it is the responsibility of the Federal Government not to pick and choose which Americans are really Americans. It is the responsibility of the Federal Government to stand with all American communities in crisis. We have to do it now. The needs are pressing. The people are waiting. When somebody serves in the Armed Forces--whether they are from Puerto Rico, Alabama, or Vermont--they don't pick and choose and say: Well, I will go to bat if this matter tells me to, but not this one.  I alert my colleagues that I ask unanimous consent that it be in order to offer amendment No. 205 to Shelby amendment No. 201 and that the amendment be agreed to with no intervening action or debate."

                "speech":"Mr. President, this afternoon I rise to urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the pending Shelby amendment on the floor.  My amendment provides critical resources to those impacted by a wide range of natural disasters in 2018--fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and tornadoes, among others. It also includes funding to begin to address some of the 2019 disaster damage. This funding, I believe, is essential to aid our fellow Americans who are working to pick up the pieces and move on. There is a broad agreement, basically, on both sides of the aisle--Democrat and Republican--that this legislation should address 2019 disasters, and, both, my amendment and the underlying bill, do this.  There are, however, two glaring differences that I would like to discuss briefly. First, the Shelby amendment provides assistance to those affected by the 2019 disasters. The underlying bill does not. Secondly, the Shelby amendment has the support of the President. The underlying bill does not.  This assistance is not just for those whose lives were destroyed by the tornado that recently hit my home State of Alabama. It is also for those whose homes, crops, and livestock have been swept away by catastrophic flooding in the Midwest that we all witnessed recently.  Thus far, my Democratic colleagues have been unwilling to help these people unless their demands are met. What are their demands? Not more resources for 2018 or 2019 disasters, which is what the thrust of this bill is about. No, instead they demand nearly $1 billion more for Puerto Rico. We all agree that Puerto Rico was devastated in 2017 by Hurricane Maria. That is why Congress provided Puerto Rico billions of dollars in aid in a supplemental last March right here in the Congress. Yet much of the funding that we provided has not been spent yet--billions of dollars. In fact, the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently reported that Puerto Rico has $1.5 billion in community development block grant funding available but has only spent $42,000. Think about that.  Why, then, are my Democratic colleagues seeking to include $431 million more for community development block grants for Puerto Rico but not $1 for folks in the Midwest who continue to watch the floodwaters rise as we speak?  The one piece of Puerto Rican funding we agree is essential--in fact, it is urgent--is nutrition assistance. They need it, and they need it now. That is why my amendment includes $600 million to provide the people of Puerto Rico the food safety net they need now.  I believe we need to move forward with this disaster package so that those who have thus far received nothing from this Congress and those in desperate need of assistance can move on with their lives. We should not further delay, I believe, this assistance. Those in need must not be forced to wait any longer.  I also wholeheartedly agree with my colleagues who said in a recent letter to Senate and House leadership: ``Providing desperately needed relief to impacted communities should be a bipartisan, bicameral priority and continued inaction is unacceptable.''  I hope we will all join together to provide assistance to those who urgently need it today, regardless of whether the State we represent has been struck by disasters covered in this bill.  Only one of the two options before the Senate seeks to help everyone impacted by disasters and can be signed into law, and that is the Shelby amendment. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Ohio, Sherrod Brown, to mark the bicentennial anniversary of the birth of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise. Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise founded the Central Conference of American Rabbis in 1889, and this year, its members are celebrating the 130th anniversary of its establishment at their annual convention in my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise is widely acknowledged as one of the fathers of American Reform Judaism. We would like to recognize the bicentennial anniversary of Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise's birth, as well as his extraordinary professional achievements, which have had an indelible effect on the religious life of the American nation.  He created three major American institutions, all still vibrant today: the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, now the Union for Reform Judaism, in 1873; the Hebrew Union College, HUC, in 1875; and the Central Conference of American Rabbis, CCAR, in 1889. As founding president and faculty member of HUC for 25 years, Wise shaped and established Jewish seminary education in America. As CCAR president, he guided a fledgling American rabbinate to take its place within the broader American clergy as equal partners. Celebrating the 130th anniversary of its founding in 2019, the CCAR is today the world's oldest and largest rabbinical association.  In 1854, Wise founded and edited a weekly newspaper, the Israelite--later, The American Israelite--in Cincinnati. The following year, Wise founded and edited a German language newspaper, ``Die Deborah.'' Wise was also a scholar and educator. He authored over a dozen volumes, both fiction and nonfiction, many of which dealt with intergroup relations and the place of the Jew within American society.  It is a deep source of pride to us and so many Ohioans that the roots of Reform Judaism run through Cincinnati and endure there. We are so proud of Hebrew Union College and all who serve there and learn there now, and we know that all leads back to the man we honor today, Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise.  Isaac Mayer Wise was an American icon. His writings have been studied by scholars of many disciplines and backgrounds and we are proud to recognize him today."

Rabbi Wise adopted Ohio as his home and is recognized as the father of American Reform Judaism. His ideas and teachings and the many great institutions he founded have had a profound effect on American Judaism and on people of faith throughout our country and around the world.  Rabbi Wise believed in liberty, in life, and in faith; he wanted to ensure that his ancient religious tradition, which had sustained people for millennia, remained relevant in a new and fast-changing nation. He pioneered ideas like men and women sitting together during services and choral singing and gave so many a new way to understand and practice their faith.  The groundbreaking institutions he founded left an indelible mark on Judaism and remain an integral part of our country's religious life to this day: the Central Conference of American Rabbis--CCAR--the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, today known as the Union for Reform Judaism, and Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati.  Rabbi Wise made Cincinnati his home, and in large part because of the institutions he created, Cincinnati became central to the fabric of American Judaism. HUC is a center of Jewish thought, and this year, the CCAR will celebrate its 130th anniversary in the Queen City.

It is my privilege to honor a Florida small business that has worked so diligently to expand opportunity within their community, proving that small businesses are the backbone of our economy and the heartbeat of Main Street. This week it is my privilege to honor Sunshine Peanut Company of Jacksonville, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.  Founded in 2005, Sunshine Peanut Company is Florida's only peanut butter producer and processes more than 10 million pounds of peanut butter each year. Sunshine Peanut Company, owned by CEO Jeff Turbeville and his brother David, completes every phase of production, from roasting to packaging, entirely in house.  Focusing on competitive cost, high quality, and timely delivery and with the help of the Jacksonville Small Business Development Center, Sunshine Peanut Company has become a leader in the peanut processing industry. Through the utilization of their Small Business Administration HUBZone certification, Sunshine Peanut Company has been awarded contracts to sell their high-quality peanut butter to hospitals, schools, universities, and correctional facilities.  Sunshine Peanut Company's work with the Florida Department of Corrections goes far beyond just supplying peanut butter. Jeff employs a number of rehabilitated offenders, and David, a former police officer, understands firsthand the criminal justice system and the support that parolees need. Jeff takes his role as an employer and community sponsor seriously, and his dedication to provide dignified work to the members of his community that need it the most is an outstanding example of community support. Sunshine Peanut Company's efforts have resulted in reduced recidivism and increased opportunity within his community.  Jeff's efforts and Sunshine Peanut Company's success has not gone unnoticed. He was recently honored as the 2019 Florida Small business Person of the Year by the Small Business Administration. This distinction is awarded to an entrepreneur who represents diversity, hard work, and perseverance. Jeff's commitment to both his company and his community have made him a clear choice for this award. He will be honored this year in Washington, DC, at the beginning of National Small Business Week.  Sunshine Peanut Company is a great example of how dignified work can lead to community engagement and business expansion, while changing lives for the better. I commend Jeff and the Sunshine Peanut Company on their dedication to their community and am honored to name them as the Senate Small Business of the Week. I wish them good luck and look forward to watching their continued growth and success."

It is also home to some of Montana's most unique buildings, including the Yucca Theatre in Hysham, a 1931 Spanish Mission-style beauty that David and Jim Manning built to give residents hope during the Great Depression.  The folks in Treasure County are used to fighting for recognition. At the time of its inception, neighboring counties thought the citizens were trying to syphon tax revenue from larger counties surrounding it.  But the residents of Treasure County were adamant their county be recognized, and in 1919, Hysham was named the county seat.  Since, Treasure County has been home to thousands of farmers, ranchers, Montana's longest serving legislator, and even NASA astronaut Frank Borman, as well as the deer, antelope, pheasants, geese, turkeys, grouse, sage hens, and ducks that have called this area home for millennia and that add to the natural splendor of this beautiful place.

                "speech":"Mr. President, we all recognize that a postsecondary education is required for most family-sustaining, middle-class jobs, and that an educated workforce is essential to a modern, productive economy. A report by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce found that college-level intensive business services have replaced manufacturing as the largest sector in the U.S. economy, and that while college-educated workers make up only 32 percent of the workforce, they now produce more than 50 percent of the Nation's economic output, up from 13 percent in 1967. A college degree also pays off, with one recent analysis estimating that the typical college graduate will earn $900,000 more of their lifetime than the typical high school graduate.  Yet just as there is growing recognition that postsecondary education is indispensable in the modern economy, families are being required to shoulder growing debt burdens that threaten access to college and their financial health. According to an analysis by the Federal Reserve, student loan debt per capita doubled between 2005 and 2014, rising from $5,000 to $10,000. This is a growing drag on our economy. As student loan debt has grown, young adults have put off buying homes or cars, starting a family, saving for retirement, or launching new businesses. They have literally mortgaged their economic future.  We know that student loan borrowers are struggling. The Secretary of Education just testified before the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee that 43 percent of the student loans in the nearly $1.5 trillion Federal student loan portfolio are in default, more than 30 days delinquent, or negatively amortized. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reports that the balance of defaulted loans now exceeds $120 billion. More than 8 million borrowers currently have a loan in default.  Default is catastrophic for student loan borrowers. Only in rare instances can the debt be discharged in bankruptcy. The Federal government has the power to withhold tax refunds, garnish wages, and even garnish Social Security benefits to collect defaulted student loans.  We have seen the costs to students and taxpayers when institutions are not held accountable. Corinthian Colleges and ITT are two examples of institutions that failed their students while benefitting from Federal student aid. Their fraudulent business practices eventually led to their demise, but not before leaving their students and taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in student loan debt. More recently, we have seen the closure of Argosy University, South University, and the Art Institutes, all operated by the Dream Center, leave roughly 26,000 students in the lurch.  We cannot wait until an institution is catastrophically failing its students before taking action. Institutions need greater financial incentives to act before default rates rise. Simply put, we cannot tackle the student loan debt crisis without States and institutions stepping up and taking greater responsibility for college costs and student borrowing.  That is why I am pleased to reintroduce the Protect Student Borrowers Act with Senators Durbin, Warren, and Murphy. Our legislation seeks to ensure there is more skin in the game when it comes to student loan debt by setting stronger market incentives for colleges and universities to provide better and more affordable education to students, which should in turn help put the brakes on rising student loan defaults.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act would hold colleges and universities accountable for student loan defaults by requiring them to repay a percentage of defaulted loans. Only institutions that have one-third or more of their students borrow would be included in the bill's risk-sharing requirements based on their cohort default rate. Risk-sharing requirements would kick in when the default rate exceeds 15 percent. As the institution's default rate rises, so too will the institution's risk-share payment.  The Protect Student Borrowers Act also provides incentives for institutions to take proactive steps to ease student loan debt burdens and reduce default rates. Colleges and universities can reduce or eliminate their payments if they implement a comprehensive student loan management plan. The Secretary may waive or reduce the payments for institutions whose mission is to serve low-income and minority students, such as community colleges, Historically Black Institutions, or Hispanic-Serving Institutions--if they are making progress in their student loan management plans.  The risk-sharing payments would be invested in helping struggling borrowers, preventing future default and delinquency, and increasing Pell Grants at institutions that enroll a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients and have low default rates.  With the stakes so high for students and taxpayers, it is only fair that institutions bear some of the risk in the student loan program.  We need to tackle student loan debt and college affordability from multiple angles. All stakeholders in the system must do their part. With the Protect Student Borrowers Act, we are providing the incentives and resources for institutions to take more responsibility to address college affordability and student loan debt and improve student outcomes. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill and look forward to working with them to include it and other key reforms in the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Mr. President, we know that the quality of teachers and principals are two of the most important in-school factors related to student achievement. Yet the pipeline into the profession is in disrepair. A report from the American Association of Colleges of Teacher Education showed that the number of education degrees awarded peaked at 200,000 per year in the 1970s and has dwindled to fewer than 100,000 today. This is at a time when all fifty States have reported experiencing statewide teacher shortages in at least one teaching area for the 2016-17 or 2017-18 school year. If we want to improve our schools, it is essential that we invest in the professional preparation of teachers, principals, and other educators. As such, today, I am reintroducing the Educator Preparation Reform Act with my colleagues Senators Casey and Coons to ensure that the Federal government continues to be a partner in addressing this critical national need.  The impact of educator shortages falls the hardest on our most vulnerable students in our highest need communities. Rhode Island is no exception, with Providence, the largest school district, facing an acute shortage of teachers certified to teach English language learners. My home State has also reported shortages in special education, science, math, world languages, and school nurses.  We cannot solve this problem without improving both teacher and principal preparation. We need to make sure that our educator preparation programs are worthy of the professionals entering the field and the students they will serve. The Educator Preparation Reform Act is a key part of the solution.  Our legislation builds on the successful Teacher Quality Partnership Program, which I helped author in the 1998 reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. It continues the partnership between high-need school districts, institutions of higher education, and educator preparation programs to reform pre-service programs based on the unique needs of the partners. Among the key changes are specific attention and emphasis on principals and the addition of a residency program for new principals. Improving instruction is a team effort, with principals at the helm. This bill better connects teacher preparation with principal preparation. The Educator Preparation Reform Act will also allow partnerships to develop preparation programs for other areas of instructional need, such as for school librarians, counselors, or other academic support professionals.  The bill streamlines the accountability and reporting requirements for teacher preparation programs to provide greater transparency on key quality measures such as admissions standards, requirements for clinical practice, placement of graduates, retention in the field of teaching, and teacher performance, including student-learning outcomes. All programs--whether traditional or alternative routes to certification--will report on the same measures.  Under our legislation, States will be required to identify at-risk and low-performing programs and provide them with technical assistance and a timeline for improvement. States would be encouraged to close programs that do not improve.  Our legislation also makes important improvements to the TEACH Grants. It focuses the grants on the later years of teacher preparation, reducing the potential of the grants being converted to loans if a student decides to change majors. Additionally, it allows prorating the amount of grants converted to loans, giving teachers credit for partially completing the service requirement. Finally, it requires the Department of Education to establish an appeals process for grants wrongly converted to loans and to report to Congress annually on the number of conversions and appeals.  We have been fortunate to work with many stakeholders on this legislation. Organizations that have endorsed the Educator Preparation Reform Act include: the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, American Federation of Teachers, Higher Education Consortium for Special Education, Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Association of State Directors of Special Education, National Education Association, Public Advocacy for Kids, and the Teacher Education Division of the Council for Exceptional Children.  I look forward to working to incorporate this legislation into the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort and support this legislation."

                "speech":"Mr. President, 4 years ago, about this time of the night on a Monday, I made a speech about Woody Woodside. Four years later, I make another speech about Woody Woodside.  Four years ago, I acknowledged his 30 years of service to the people of Brunswick, GA, Glynn County, the Chamber of Commerce, and two Members of Congress for whom he worked over the years. Tonight, I praise him for 34 years of service and for the fact that he is going to retire later this year.  It is time for me to say that Woody Woodside is one of the most unique individuals who all of us know in our State. He is someone who is always there when there is a problem to be worked on. He is always there with a positive attitude. He is somebody who always thinks of a way to fix a problem. He is somebody who doesn't call to complain but calls to be a help.  Woody is a great man. He is a great friend. I have known him and his beautiful wife, Ellen, for a long time. They have a beautiful family. Their daughter, Mary Gould, is a wonderful lady. They lost their young son, Jay, a few years ago when he passed away. He was one of the finest kids I ever met. He worked here in Washington a couple of times. Once, he worked a short time for me. He had the spirit that his father has and his mother has--the spirit of can-do, the spirit of loving his community, the spirit of being a good human being.  Woody is interesting, and he is unique. He went to the Citadel and served in the U.S. Army and Georgia Army National Guard. Woody did a lot of work in Congress. He worked for 11 years for ``Bo'' Ginn, a Congressman from Georgia, who later ran for the Governor of Georgia. For 3 years, he also worked for Lindsay Thomas, another former Congressman. So he had 14 years of work in the Congress of the United States before he went home to Brunswick and Golden Isles.  The Brunswick Golden Isles is a very unique place. You have the Sea Island Company that developed Sea Island, which is one of the finest four-star resorts anywhere. You have fishing, which is an industry that serves our State so well. We only have 123 miles of shoreline, but we have lots of fish, we have lots of crabs, and we have lots of shrimp. It is a great industry for our State and a great, prosperous industry for that part of our State. The Golden Isles is a very unique place, for it is the estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. It is where the food chain starts. If there were no Brunswick and if there were no marshes or glens, there would be no food chain; there would be no fish or wildlife.  This is a pristine area that we have worked for years to preserve and maintain by passing wetlands bills, by passing clean water bills, by doing all of the things you need to do to make sure you are doing everything you can to keep the water clean and to keep that industry viable. Woody was not just a chamber leader because he had to do it, but as a citizen, he wanted to do it. Woody is a leader and has been a leader for clean water and for the coastline to be clean and for the industries that depend on the ocean and the sea and for that part of our State.  We have a lot of chamber presidents in our State. We have 159 counties, so I imagine we have 159 chamber presidents. That is a lot. We have no one who is more active or more involved in his State activities or his local activities than Woody Woodside. Of our State chamber of commerce, he has been an officer and adviser for years. He has been on more economic development councils than have most Governors. He is outspoken, not to a fault but to a critical need when we need him to say what he needs to say for all of the right reasons. For years, he has been selected as one of the most outstanding Georgians by Georgia Trend magazine.  All in all, he is the whole package. He is outstanding; he is smart; he is likable; he loves government and what government can do as a partner with the private sector. I love him as a friend. So, in knowing that Woody is going to retire this year, I take this time to say: Woody, you have been special for lots of reasons.  I do lots of these at the requests of chambers of commerce for people I know, in some cases, but for whom, most of the time, I don't know. They are hard to do. It is hard to find something that is the right thing to say about somebody you don't know. I know Woody Woodside. I know his heart and I know his record and I know what he has done.  Woody, you have been everything a person could ask for. You and your wife are everything we could ask for as leaders. You are a wonderful human being, a great American, and a great Georgian.  May God bless you and your family in your retirement. Thank you for your service to our State for many, many years.  I yield the floor."

Suffice it to say, tonight, Woody Woodside is one of the greatest people to be able to get things done with whom I have ever worked, and when he disagrees with you, he does it in a way in which you actually like him for his disagreement. He is a bulldog when he gets on something, and I have the highest respect for what he has been able to accomplish in his career. I will have much more to say about that in the days to come."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as an outsider to this political process, it is easy to be frustrated with how slowly the Senate moves. It is easy to find fault with colleagues. As an outsider here, it is very easy to think we are not focused on getting results. I usually try to temper that with some rational thought about, well, this is the way things work, et cetera, et cetera, but I didn't see that tonight, and I am very frustrated with the vote. What we just witnessed on the floor of the U.S. Senate was nothing but pure partisan politics.  Our colleagues across the aisle blocked our disaster relief bill because they said it didn't include enough for Puerto Rico. That was one of several reasons. To date, $40 billion in Federal disaster relief aid has already been allocated for Puerto Rico, and it is eligible for another $50 billion-plus, potentially, which has already been allocated.  How much aid did the farmers in the Southeast receive after Hurricane Michael just 6 months ago? Not one dime. Now, why is that critical? You say: Well, OK. It takes time. Yes, it takes time. These farmers lost their livelihoods, and it hit them at the very time when their harvests were coming due last fall, October 10. It has been 6 months now. They have not received a dime from the Federal Government. The State has moved in with minor help, but these bridge loans these farmers have been using are running out; therefore, we were hoping this bill tonight would have given them some direct relief.  Let's put this in perspective.  Congress appropriated $136 billion for 2017's natural disasters across our country. That was for Hurricane Irma, Hurricane Maria, Hurricane Harvey, and the California wildfires--in 2017, $136 billion. Before then, in 2013, $50.5 billion was appropriated for Hurricane Sandy, mostly for New Jersey.  In this bill from tonight, we were only talking about $13.45 billion for unprecedented hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and wildfires over the last year. Listen to the number of States we were talking about: Florida, Georgia, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alaska, Hawaii, California, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas. That is right. This $13.45 billion included only $3 billion for farmers across five States in the Southeast.  President Trump visited that damage, and Vice President Pence visited that damage. I was personally privileged, as was Johnny Isakson, to travel with him that day to see this damage. You only have to see it to understand how ravaging this was to the businesses that have been built up over generations with regard to these family farmers.  President Trump has done his part. He has been very reasonable in this negotiation. He stepped up and did the right thing with regard to Puerto Rico. He agreed that because the nutrition benefits were running out under the prior allocations that we just mentioned, he stepped up and said, yes, he would support $600 million in further assistance for Puerto Rico nutrition so that those benefits would not run out and so that it would, hopefully, in the negotiations, break the logjam.  It did no such thing. This $600 million was exactly what Puerto Rico needed, and President Trump saw that. I give him high marks for stepping up and taking the political risk to go ahead and do that in addition to what had already been done for Puerto Rico over the last 2 years. In fact, Puerto Rico's own Representative in Congress, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, supports this disaster relief bill that Senator Isakson and I and others sponsored.  She said:       I urge for the swift Senate passage of $600 million for      nutrition assistance. Over 1.3 million of my constituents are      already experiencing cuts in their food benefits. Puerto Rico      needs this funding and needs it now.  When you listen to pleas like that, I can only think of one word for our colleagues across the aisle in this episode, and that is that it is very similar to what has happened on the border. It is hypocritical to me to think that they asked for that and then voted no against it. What we see here is pure partisan politics.  The American people are not stupid. It is clear that this had nothing to do with Puerto Rico and that it really hadn't had much to do with disaster relief. This vote was really pure partisan politics. It had everything to do with obstructing this President and preventing him from keeping his promise of helping the American people recover from the tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, and floods that have ravaged our communities.  The Democrats ought to be ashamed. They are holding our farmers hostage right now for the political gain they foresee in their having taken this position. It is unacceptable. They are gambling with people's lives, and I don't overstate that. Some people will not recover from this. They will get out of farming. For those who stay in, it will take a decade to recover even with this government assistance, and many will have to get out of the crops they were growing to just survive in the next year.  We have farmers in Georgia whom I know personally who are on their second bridge loan. As an individual businessperson, I have done those in my career. I know how hard it is to go back after one bridge loan and ask for an extension or for another bridge loan to get to the point at which, hopefully, the Federal Government will step in and provide much needed assistance to back up these bank loans. These farmers are coming to the end of their ability to do that. I empathize with the bankers as well. They have a very difficult time giving bridge loans in addition to what they have already done until they get some degree of certainty about what it is we in Congress are going to do.  It is unacceptable that this intransigence in Washington continues to threaten the livelihoods the very people who sent us here to represent them. Because the Democrats chose to play politics today, farmers across the Southeast may, indeed, lose their businesses. Puerto Rican families will not have access to the food benefits they desperately need. California wildfire victims will not get any Federal assistance to help rebuild until we get this done. The list goes on.  I challenge each of the Senators in this body who voted against this disaster relief bill tonight to go down to Georgia, to Florida, or to South Carolina and look the farmers in the eye and tell them that, tonight, we chose politics over helping Americans in need. It is a shameful night in the American Senate.  I thank Senator Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and its ranking member, Senator Leahy. They have worked diligently to try to find a compromise in here, but it is hard to compromise when there is only one party playing.  In conclusion, I want farmers across the Southeast to understand that I, Senator Isakson, Senator Rubio, Senator Scott, and many others--Senator Tillis, Senator Burr, Senator Lindsey Graham, Senator Tim Scott from South Carolina, and even one of the Democrats, Senator Doug Jones--are all committed, along with Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Rick Scott of Florida, and are not giving up. This is not the end of this tale. I want the farmers and the bankers in these five States to understand we are going to continue this fight.  I thank Leader McConnell for continuing to give us this opportunity. It took a lot of time to get to this vote on the Senate floor tonight, and I thank him for that.  For the people of these States who were affected, don't lose heart. We will get this done eventually.  I yield the floor."

Mr. Speaker, every day, the Department of Homeland Security's workforce carries out dozens of critical missions, which are as diverse as preventing terrorism, securing cyberspace, transportation security, and disaster recovery.  These 240,000 men and women deserve to have their contributions to keeping the Nation secure valued by not only the American people but also by DHS itself. Yet, even before the President's 35-day partial government shutdown earlier this year, morale within DHS was a persistent problem. In fact, for the past 7 years, DHS has ranked dead last among all large Federal agencies in the Partnership for Public Service's annual ``Best Places to Work in the Federal Government'' survey.  This is unacceptable. Senior DHS leadership, most especially the Secretary of Homeland Security, needs to prioritize improving morale within the DHS workforce. In the Obama administration, then-DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson began to address this operational imperative through a range of programs under the unity of effort umbrella. Unfortunately, the current administration largely abandoned those promising efforts.  I have long been committed to improving conditions for the DHS workforce. To that end, I reintroduced H.R. 1433, the DHS MORALE Act, a bill that passed the House unanimously and received tremendous support from the labor organizations representing the DHS labor force.  The DHS MORALE Act requires DHS to develop and implement policies related to leadership development, employee engagement, career progression, and employee recommendations.  This Congress, two new provisions were added to the bill. The first directs the DHS Chief Human Capital Officer to analyze government-wide Federal workforce satisfaction or morale surveys to inform efforts to improve morale. The second provision requires a report to Congress on the impact of the recent government shutdown on DHS human resources and morale. Both of these measures would be a step toward fixing the longstanding morale problems at DHS.  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of H.R. 1433, and I reserve the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, school violence continues to devastate communities and take the lives of so many young people. In 2018, we saw a record number of school shootings across the country. In response, Congressman   Donald Payne, Jr., introduced H.R. 1593, the Coordinating and Leveraging Activities for School Security Act, known as the CLASS Act.  H.R. 1593 seeks to ensure that the Department of Homeland Security organizes itself to help bolster school security. Specifically, the CLASS Act establishes a standing body within DHS to coordinate the Department's school security initiatives, activities, plans, and policies. Additionally, to help ensure that DHS gives school security adequate attention, H.R. 1593 requires the Department to report to Congress on the work of the council.  Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1593, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today I rise in support of H.R. 1593, the CLASS Act.  While the Department of Homeland Security already coordinates its policies relating to school security and safety across the Department, codifying this council into law will ensure important channels for information sharing and coordination are maintained during changes in administration.  Currently, DHS utilizes a number of tools to assist in the protection of our Nation's children. For example, the United States Secret Service National Threat Assessment Center has created an operational guide to provide actionable steps that schools can take to develop specific violence prevention plans for their students.  Additionally, DHS' Office of Academic Engagement, or OAE, supports the Department's mission by building, improving, and leveraging relationships with the academic community. OAE's work focuses on outreach, engagement, and resiliency by supporting institutions of higher learning and the K-12 community in preparing for, responding to, and recovering from threats and hazards that pose the greatest risk.  OAE offers a Campus Resilience Program Resource Library, which provides the academic community with access to guidelines, strategies, and resources to address the risks and vulnerabilities on their campus. The library is organized into categories according to a specific threat or hazard as outlined in the Federal Emergency Management Agency's National Preparedness Goal.  While numerous DHS components and agencies provide resources and recommendations with regard to school security, it is imperative that the work be done in unison and there is coordination across all relevant agencies within DHS.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, school shootings are dreadful atrocities that are plaguing our Nation. Nearly 20 years have passed since the horrendous shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado, where 13 people lost their lives, yet schools and universities continue to be soft targets for deadly attacks.  Last year, between the months of January and May 2018, there was the Marjory Stoneman Douglas shooting that claimed the lives of 17 individuals, but there were also shootings nearly every week at our Nation's schools.  As history has shown us, there is no profile for a school likely to be targeted. This tragedy can happen at any school.  In 2012, after the horrific shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, the Department of Homeland Security conducted an internal review of actions that its components were taking to help improve school security. Today, I understand that multiple DHS components currently have programs underway to address school security, but the degree to which there is coordination is unclear.  The Coordinating and Leveraging Activities for School Security, or CLASS, Act will establish a standing council within the Department of Homeland Security to coordinate school security activities, plans, and policies. The coordinating council would include all the key players in school security at the Department. They include the DHS Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans; the Director of Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection; the FEMA Administrator; the Secret Service Director; and the heads of DHS' Offices of Academic Engagement and Public Affairs.  This legislation was not developed in a vacuum. Inspiration for this legislation came directly from experiences of those impacted by school violence and from the input of New Jerseyans.  Last July, my subcommittee held a school security field hearing in Newark. At the hearing, the subcommittee heard from the New Jersey State Police, the New Jersey Department of Education, the New Jersey Association of School Resource Officers, and the New Jersey Office of Homeland Security about the security risks the schools face and how Congress can provide support.  At the hearing and subsequently through our outreach and oversight, we came to understand there needs to be better coordination of school security activities within DHS to bolster coordination and minimize fragmentation.  As a leader in developing school security best practices and policies, it is important for DHS to have a formal school security body so that it can provide an example to those on the State and local levels on how to coordinate the protection of schools.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation."

Mr. Speaker, in the almost 18 years since the September 11 terrorist attacks, threats to the American public have become increasingly complex and today include threats posed by foreign fighters.  In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security's Task Force on Combating Terrorism and Foreign Fighter Travel issued a bipartisan report that included a number of recommendations.  H.R. 1590 requires the Department of Homeland Security to develop and conduct a foreign fighter exercise that could be built into existing DHS domestic preparedness exercises. Importantly, after the exercise, DHS is required to submit an after-action report to Congress detailing the initial findings, plans for incorporating lessons learned, and any legislative changes informed by this exercise.  A very similar version of this legislation passed the full House last Congress. I am pleased that, through the markup process, modest modifications were made to improve the measure.

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of my bill, H.R. 1590, the Terrorist and Foreign Fighter Travel Exercise Act of 2019. This legislation seeks to better position the United States Government and relevant State, local, and private-sector agencies to detect and prevent terrorist and foreign fighter travel.  In 2015, the Committee on Homeland Security developed a bipartisan task force to investigate the threat from individuals leaving the United States to join terrorist groups abroad. The task force reported that nearly 4,500 individuals from Western countries, with over 250 from the United States, traveled to join Islamic terrorist groups. It goes on to detail 32 findings and over 50 recommendations to address this national security issue.  During both the 114th Congress and the 115th Congress, former Representative and now Senator Martha McSally introduced this legislation. Both times, the bill passed unanimously in the House.  Senator McSally previously stated: ``The abilities of these hardened fighters to return to the United States is a legitimate security concern to the homeland. Catching individuals who are looking to join the ranks and train with ISIS and other terrorist organizations prior to their initial departure is equally important and should be a goal for law enforcement as well.''  Mr. Speaker, these words still ring true today. Just last year, an Ohio man was arrested at the John Glenn International Airport trying to fly to Kazakhstan. His intent was to be smuggled into Afghanistan to train with ISIS with the possibility of conducting terrorist projects in the United States.  According to an FBI release on this matter, when the terrorist was asked what sort of training he wished to receive, he allegedly stated that he wanted to receive ``weapons experts training, planning, executing, hit and run, capturing high-value targets, ways to break into homes and avoid security.''  The ability of these foreign fighters to return to the United States is a legitimate security concern. Preventing their initial departure should be a law enforcement priority as well.  Furthermore, last year, the White House released the National Strategy to Combat Terrorist Travel. It ``outlines how the United States Government will expand coordination and maximize the full capabilities of Federal departments and agencies to identify, detect, and deter terrorists from transiting international borders.''  One of the Strategy's primary goals is to identify and deter terrorists before they travel, to enhance intelligence gathering and analysis, and to improve the sharing of terrorist-related identity data. H.R. 1590 complements and supports these efforts.  The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the appropriate Federal, State, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies, foreign governments, and appropriate private-sector entities, to develop and conduct an exercise related to the detection and prevention of terrorist and foreign fighter travel.  The bill also requires the Secretary to produce an after-action report to Congress, presenting the findings of the exercise and to quickly incorporate those lessons learned into future operations of the department.  Finally, it requires that the National Exercise Program be designed to include emerging threats.  I cannot stress enough the importance of H.R. 1590. This bill represents continued action in combating terrorism and ensuring the safety of our Nation. As the threats of terrorism continue to evolve, we must remain vigilant in our resolve to combat our enemies.  Our Nation's law enforcement, of all jurisdictions, whether it be Federal or local, need to have access to the valuable information and resources that this bill would provide so that our communities can be protected from terrorist activity.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bipartisan and commonsense bill. I urge the adoption of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time."

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1589, the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2019.  In the last two Congresses, the Committee on Homeland Security has held several hearings on Federal, State, and local capabilities to prevent, identify, and respond to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear attack.  At those hearings, State and local stakeholders, including public health professionals, emergency managers, and first responders, expressed general awareness of the evolving CBRN threat, but expressed frustration with the level of information sharing about such threats.  H.R. 1589 seeks to facilitate improved CBRN information sharing by directing DHS to analyze CBRN-related terrorist threats and share relevant threat information with Federal, State, and local stakeholders.  These activities could help improve situational awareness at all levels of government and help DHS grant recipients better target their limited resources.  Prior versions of this measure passed the House overwhelmingly in the last two Congresses.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure once again, and I reserve the balance of my time."

H.R. 1589 would address this threat by requiring the Office of Intelligence and Analysis within the Department of Homeland Security to conduct analysis of terrorist capabilities relating to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear materials, as well as threats to the homeland from global and infectious diseases.  To improve coordination with local law enforcement, H.R. 1589 requires the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to share threat information not only with Federal entities, but also State, local, Tribal, and territorial agencies.

She championed educational equity for African-American students, especially boys, and believed passionately that it is better to raise a child than to mend an adult.  Dr. Shepherd decided she wanted to be a teacher at the age of three, when the kindness and support of a Sunday school teacher made an indelible impression on her. She loved seeing a child work to understand something, and then light up when the concept was mastered. She only left the classroom when she realized that she could have a multiplier effect on students by nurturing teachers, who could go on to support even more students.  She spent three decades of her half-century career as principal at the same school, Dublin Avenue Elementary, which was later re-named Tom Bradley Global Awareness Magnet. She always looked for innovative ways to address the challenges she saw her students face, including by pioneering an academy for African-American boys at Bradley to tackle achievement gaps.  Her signature hats made her unmistakable on school grounds. For years, before class could begin, her students would gather on the playground to enthusiastically recite the mantra: ``With passion and persistence we will perpetually pursue excellence, for learning is our top priority.'' She had the privilege of seeing her first students grow to send her their own children as students, then their grandchildren and even their great-grandchildren over the course of an award-winning, 56-year career in education.  A product of Los Angeles through and through, she grew up in the LAUSD, attended Los Angeles City College and then California State University, Los Angeles. She went on to earn a Master of Science degree from Pepperdine University and a Doctorate of Philosophy from Golden State University. She married and raised her family in LA, and was a faithful member of Bethlehem Temple Church (and served as Sunday School Superintendent, of course). Her service extended to playing leadership roles in many civic and professional organizations, as well, including the Council of Black Administrators and the YMCA Metro LA.  She also believed in lifelong education and was a long-time president of the pioneering Our Authors Study Club, founded to pursue Carter G. Woodson's vision of creating and disseminating knowledge about Black history across the nation."

On February 1, 1954, Sergeant Brown began basic training at Fort Dix, currently Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. Sergeant Brown left Fort Dix for Fort Campbell, Kentucky where he went through Airborne Training to learn how to be a paratrooper.   While serving as a paratrooper from 1954 to 1968, Sergeant Brown attended Jump Master School where he became a Jump Master. After Jump Master School, Sergeant Brown received a Compassionate Reassignment to Fort Dix where he became a Drill Sergeant for ten years.   In 1968, Sergeant Brown received orders to report to Panama for jungle training in preparation for Vietnam. Upon returning home for seven days, Sergeant Brown was flown out to Oakland, California.   It was in Oakland where Sergeant Brown changed from his military gear to his jungle fatigue gear in preparation for Vietnam.   From 1968 to 1969, Sergeant Brown's service in Vietnam consisted of twenty-nine-day patrols followed by three days in base. Sergeant Brown continued this cycle for eleven months. For his combat bravery in Vietnam, Sergeant Brown received the Air Medal, the Bronze Star, the Commendation Medal, and the Combat Infantry Badge.   Following his service in the Vietnam, Sergeant Brown returned home and began working at the NCO Academy at Fort Campbell until his retirement at Fort Dix on January 31, 1979. Commendably, Sergeant Brown's military career spanned a total of twenty-five years.   Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in celebrating and recognizing the valiant service Sergeant First Class Edward I. Brown dedicated to his country."

Since its inception, the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center has been a leader in the Central New York region in the fight against child abuse, human trafficking, and victim support.   In the late 1990s, Dr. Ann Botash and Martha Ryan founded the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center with the goal of ending child abuse by raising awareness and providing much needed services to victims in Central New York. From the opening of its first facility in 2002, McMahon Ryan has transformed the way in which child victims in Central New York are cared for and treated. The organization applied more resources to assist victims of child abuse, offering legal, medical, psychological, and social services under one roof. McMahon Ryan has grown extensively since opening its first facility in 2002, expanding both outreach and services.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in recognizing the important work of the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center. Throughout their first 20 years, the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center has brought a greater level of awareness to child abuse in Central New York. The organization has assisted in the recoveries of hundreds of child victims and provided vital assistance to families. I applaud the work of the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center, and similar organizations around the country, in their efforts to combat child abuse and human trafficking."

Karyn was a founding councilmember and the first woman to serve as mayor of the City of Calabasas, the most recent city to be incorporated in Los Angeles County.  Born in Detroit, Michigan on July 17, 1936, Karyn moved to California with her family as an infant, settling in Los Angeles. She attended local public schools in the Mid-Wilshire neighborhood before graduating from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she received her degree in physical education.  Karyn married James Foley in July 1969, and with their minds focused on where best to raise their new family, they moved in 1976 to Calabasas, then part of unincorporated Los Angeles County. Karyn was a community activist and engaged citizen from the moment she arrived, whether as a volunteer parent and part-time substitute teacher with the Las Virgenes Unified School District or president of the Round Meadow Elementary Parent Teacher Association. She and James also played a crucial role in the early years of the Calabasas Park Homeowners Association, with both serving as president and organizing summer activities like lakeside races and pet contests.  Karyn's leadership in the effort to push for cityhood for Calabasas was pivotal in the success of the campaign. This decade long effort culminated in the city's incorporation in 1991 as the 88th city in Los Angeles County and 466th in the State of California. She served on the Calabasas City Council from 1991 to 1997 and was the first woman to serve as mayor, from 1994 to 1995.  Even after leaving office, Karyn remained involved in civic government and helped foster the city's cultural institutions, serving on the City's first Library Commission, as well as getting involved in the Art in Public Places Committee, Friends of the Calabasas Library, Friends of the Calabasas Orchestra, and the Calabasas Players Theatrical Group.  Karyn is survived by her husband of 49 years, James; daughter, Megan and son, Patrick; and three grandchildren. I hope that Karyn's family takes comfort in knowing her passion for public service, visionary leadership, and remarkable compassion will live on in the unique identity that Calabasas has developed over the past three decades."

In 1997 she was commissioned as a member of the U.S. Army Reserves after 13 years of active duty service and received a Liberal Arts degree at Fort Hays State University in 1998. Two years later she would also finish a Master of Science in Instructional Technology from that same university.  With her degrees in hand, now-Chief Warrant Officer Wormly became a Military Personnel Technician for the 89th Regional Support Command until 2005, then moved to Germany as a Human Resource Technician.

The oldest and largest organization of its kind in Marin County, Cedars was the first residential school facility to serve individuals with mental disabilities in the western United States, a mission that it has stayed true to this day.  Founded in 1919, Cedars was originally established as a privately-owned school in Marin County for children with mental disabilities. After a change in ownership in 1938, the school grew, adding two dormitories and 22 acres of land over the next 18 years. By 1964, the school had expanded significantly, adding a ranch lodge, pool, workshop, and stables. One year later, the privately-owned school was incorporated as a nonprofit, with the name Cedars Development Foundation. As a newly minted nonprofit, the organization pivoted to focus on both the education and housing of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. This led to the opening of Cedars' first community-based home in 1968, pioneering a model for which the organization would become known. By 1984, Cedars began its Community Living Skills day program, expanding the organization's programming into skills development and community building for individuals who weren't housed by the program. Over the next seven years, Cedars would continue to innovate, adding a Community Challenges program, opening eight additional community-based homes, and initiating a successful capital campaign to renovate the original site. By 1995, the organization was officially re-named Cedars of Marin.  Today, Cedars of Marin has provided services to over 2,500 individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Through the organization's innovative community-based housing program, Cedars now houses approximately 100 individuals across its main campus and ten group homes, building a safe and productive environment for them to reach their highest levels of independence. The organization's skills-focused day programs serve over 190 individuals each weekday, creating a larger community of support for the intellectually and developmentally disabled, while also helping their families.

Mr. Parady has devoted his life to improving the quality of life in the Town of Bourne. He has held numerous posts in town and has always remained dedicated to participating in local government and making our community a better place to live. His first job was working as a lifeguard for the town, and he later held his first elected position on the town's Planning Board.  After graduating from Bourne High School, Mr. Parady received his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He then attended Suffolk Law School and was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar Association.  Back in Bourne, Mr. Parady served as a Selectman for nearly two decades, starting in 1977. During his time in office, he always strived to solve problems that would have practical and positive impacts on his community. One project he and the Board of Selectmen were particularly keen on fixing was improving Main Street. Step by step they tackled the issue, first removing a sign blocking the view of the bridge. They then worked to secure the land to build Buzzards Bay park and were given a grant to build Taylor's Point Marina. Beyond Main Street, Mr. Parady worked diligently to complete numerous public works projects, such as expanding the police station and renovating the Town Hall.  In 2001, Mr. Parady was elected to serve as town moderator, to run the town meetings he attended starting in high school. He is remembered by his colleagues as a dedicated public servant who unrelentingly worked to improve the town he loved. After serving for over four decades in numerous capacities, Mr. Parady's legacy will continue to have a positive impact in Bourne.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Robert Parady and his commitment to improving the lives of all who lived in the town of Bourne. I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing his hard work and dedication as he celebrates his retirement."

He married the love of his life Dolores (Lorrie) Gober following his graduation from the Naval Academy in 1957. They had three children, Mark, Amy and Allison and two grandchildren, James and Mary Katherine.  He served his country for 35 years until his retirement in 1992. His assignments included fighter pilot, test pilot and teacher at the Naval Academy. His command assignments included fighter squadrons VF-51 ``Screaming Eagles'' and VF-121 ``Pacemakers'', USS Kansas City and USS Constellation, Carrier Group Seven and Battle Force and Carrier Strike Forces of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. In 1988, he was assigned as the initial commander of the Combined Joint Task Force, Middle East, involving all U.S. Forces in the Persian Gulf. Ashore Admiral Brooks' major assignments included Director, Navy Space Command and Military Director of the National Reconnaissance Office.  The USS Constellation (Connie) under the command of then Captain Brooks was visited by Ronald Reagan shortly after the President's recovery from wounds received in an assassination attempt. Following his inspection, the President declared ``Connie'' to be ``America's Flagship'', presented the crew a presidential flag and announced: ``Let friend and foe alike know that America has the muscle to back up its words, and ships like this and men like you are that muscle.'' Later the Connie gained her motto, ``Go Ahead Make My Day'', which was painted on the ship's island.  Following his Navy career, the Admiral and Lorrie retired to Pell City where he continued his service as Rotary District Governor for District 6860. His philanthropic efforts included Pell City's Habitat for Humanity, the Board of the Eastern Health Foundation and the Pell City Library Guild. He was an Eagle Scout and continued throughout his life to be involved in Scouting. Posthumously, the Greater Alabama Scout Council presented the ``Heart of an Eagle'' Award to his family.

                "speech":"Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate confirmed the 31st new circuit judge since January of 2017. Eric Miller came to the Senate for our consideration with a stellar resume and a sterling legal reputation. We had every indication he would interpret our Nation's laws and Constitution as they are actually written. This is exactly the kind of judge the American people deserve to sit on our Nation's courts of appeals. That is why the Senate will continue to make judicial nominations a top priority.  This week, however, we need to make more progress on the backlog of important executive branch nominees whom Democrats' delaying tactics and obstruction have left literally languishing on the Senate calendar.  The first is Michael Desmond, the President's choice to serve as Chief Counsel of the IRS. Mr. Desmond has put his legal expertise to work through years of public service, including at the Department of Justice Tax Division and at the Department of the Treasury. He has an impressive private sector background as well.  So listen to this: In the last Congress, the Finance Committee recommended Mr. Desmond to the full Senate by a vote of 25 to 2. That was last August. Yet this noncontroversial nominee never got a floor vote and had to be sent back to the White House. Well, Mr. Desmond was renominated. Earlier this month, our colleagues on the Finance Committee reported him favorably yet again--26 to 2.  I am sorry my Democratic colleagues required us to file cloture on this thoroughly noncontroversial nominee. It is a good example of the unreasonable tactics that have, sadly, become their standing operating procedure in many cases, but I am glad we voted to advance the nomination yesterday, and I urge everyone to join me in voting to confirm him soon."

                "speech":"Mr. President, on another matter, the Environment and Public Works Committee, led by Chairman Barrasso, is meeting today to consider legislation that would help reduce, capture, and find productive uses for carbon dioxide emissions. It is an important subject and deserves a serious approach, but, as we all know, some on the far left have recently offered other ideas on this subject. That is right--the much heralded Green New Deal. Nothing says forward-thinking and fresh ideas quite like borrowing the name of an 80-plus-year-old policy program and just adding the color ``green.''  So what is this thing all about? That turns out to be an interesting question. It depends on whom you ask. The Democrats who authored it say it is a massive reorganization and government takeover of our Nation's economy and our culture. Some have argued it is the only way to stop the world from ending in about a decade.  This was interesting news, even to many of their fellow Democrats. Our colleague Senator Durbin reacted this way:       I have read it, and I have reread it, and I asked [Senator]      Ed Markey: ``What in the heck is this?''  That was the assistant Democratic leader.  But it looks like, one way or the other, the Democratic Party as a whole is eager to get behind this great idea.  So what is in it? Here are just a few of the hits in the 16-page resolution the Senate will soon be voting on. Here is one you will like: ``Upgrading all existing buildings in the United States and building new buildings.''  Don't want a Federal bureaucrat to decide how your house should look or what size it should be? Don't want to pay to rebuild the entire downtown? Don't want to tear down your small business so it can be replaced by the government? Too bad. These new social planners know best.  Here is another quote: ``Meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the United States''--listen to this--without using any American fossil fuels or nuclear power whatsoever.  That is right. It is the War on Coal on steroids. Say goodbye to all of those jobs, and say hello to a new wave of cronyism that would make the half a billion dollars in taxpayer losses from Solyndra look like pocket change. Everything in your garage will have to go too. A lengthy background document that this plan's authors have since tried to scrub from the internet helpfully explains that a Green New Deal would mean ``replac[ing] every combustion engine vehicle.''  How about this one: ``Guaranteeing a job . . . to all people of the United States.''  That one is buried on page No. 14--a government-guaranteed job for everyone. That may sound like a good utopian goal, but their handy background document makes the real intention known, promising ``economic security for all''--listen to this--even for those who are ``unwilling to work.''  That is a lot of magic wand-waving, but I have only scratched the surface. The background document also called for a plan to ``build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary.'' As our colleague Senator Hirono pointed out, this might be a tough sell in Hawaii or in Puerto Rico or in other places. The Governor of California just scaled back a high-speed rail project in California because, as he put it, it ``would cost too much and, respectfully, take too long.'' Even with heavy Federal subsidies, it is billions over budget and behind schedule.  That document also promised to, magically, ``remove pollution and . . . emissions from manufacturing'' just like that. I wonder why nobody has thought of that before.  So it is clear what we have here. It is the far left's Santa Claus wish list that is dressed up to look like serious policy.  Bad ideas are nothing new, and silly proposals come and go, but the philosophies and the ideas behind this textbook socialism are not just foolish; they are dangerous. Their ascent in the Democratic Party is a real threat to American prosperity and to working families.  Chairman Barrasso reported that one analysis found that this proposal could increase the average household's power bills by as much as--listen to this--$3,800 a year. Another estimate predicted that families would have to spend hundreds of billions of dollars just to replace common household appliances with Washington-approved models.  What about the total cost to the government for this socialist shopping spree? One recent estimate has that pegged at a cool $93 trillion over the first 10 years--more than the combined GDP of the entire world. Let me say that again. Their plan is predicted to cost more than the entire economic output of every country on Earth combined.  Remember what the American people are supposedly getting in return--a sprawling socialist state to rule over us, a host of good jobs and key industries ripped away, and an end to every energy source that the middle class can actually afford. Remember, China has already sailed past the United States in terms of carbon emissions. The far left still wants us to unilaterally disarm our whole economy--lots of pain for us and no meaningful gain in containing global emissions. We will go bankrupt, but at least it will be great for China. I bet they are cheering in the streets.  So the way I see it--the way most Republicans see it--is this proposal is either a brilliant piece of comedy or a disastrous socialist vision that is totally alien to the United States of America.  What about our Democratic colleagues? Where do they stand?  Recently, I announced that Senators will get to go on record and vote for or against all of this, but curiously enough, this planned vote was met with outrage from the very people who were claiming to champion the proposal.  Last night, our colleague from Rhode Island said it was ``truly preposterous'' for me to schedule a vote on the Green New Deal. That is not exactly a ringing endorsement of a plan the Democrats claim to support. He does not seem to be alone in his uneasiness. At one point, the Speaker of the House dismissed her party's own plan as the ``green dream.'' The senior Senator from California worried publicly the other day that there is no way to pay for it. As I noted, the assistant Democratic leader summed up a lot of people's thinking when he asked: ``What in the heck is this?'' I think a great many Americans all across the country are asking themselves the very same thing--what the heck is this?  Before much longer, every Member of this body will have a chance to go on record, loud and clear. Do our Democratic colleagues really support this fantasy novel that is masquerading as public policy? Do they really want to completely upend Americans' lives to enact some grand socialist vision? Do they really want this to be their Democratic Party? Well, before long, the Senate will vote, and these questions will be answered.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Now, the Trump administration is in the middle of two crucial negotiations with foreign capitals, the result of which will have ramifications for decades.  In Vietnam, President Trump will meet with Chairman Kim to continue discussions over the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while at the same time administration officials continue negotiations with Beijing over a major trade pact. In both instances, President Trump would have the best chance of having success if he articulated clear objectives and maintained a hard line until those objectives were achieved.  For a time, that approach--the right approach--seemed to hold sway at the White House, as sanctions and tariffs brought both North Korea and China to the negotiating table. Recently, however, President Trump seems headed down the path of capitulation on both North Korea and China, prepared to trade away our leverage in exchange for flimsy agreements. The President can't seem to stick to a policy, even when it is beginning to work. So eager is he for that quick photo op.  There is an old expression that March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. Well, based on all reports, when it comes to North Korea and China, spring is coming a little early at the White House. President Trump, on both China and North Korea, came in like a lion, with tough rhetoric and hard-line policies, but now President Trump is poised to go out like a lamb, meekly accepting half-baked agreements from both capitals for the sheer sake of it.  In North Korea the highest priority of U.S. foreign policy has been the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cessation of human rights abuses by the brutal, despotic, and murderous Kim regime. But just this weekend, before leaving for Hanoi, President Trump said: ``I don't want to rush anybody; as long as there's no testing, we're happy.'' That is a far cry from the complete denuclearization that he called for in the past, and it signals a dangerous softening of our position before the talks even started.  The irony of ironies is that for all the talk of ``maximum pressure'' and ``fire and fury,'' President Trump's stance on North Korea may wind up far weaker than Hillary Clinton's. I know he doesn't like to hear that, but the truth is the truth.  President Trump seems more interested in touting his warm relationship with Chairman Kim as an accomplishment in and of itself. President Trump's calling a brutal autocrat a friend on Twitter is no substitute for actually achieving something for the American people in Hanoi.  I hate to say it, but it would be absolutely incredible and even pathetic if President Trump were giving in to North Korea for the sake of a photo op to knock Michael Cohen's hearing from the front page, but if the past behavior of the President is any guide, something like that is, unfortunately, totally conceivable."

                "speech":"Now, Mr. President, the same situation is playing out in China. After starting down the right path, press reports indicate that President Trump appears to accept something far short of his initial aims. President Trump has already started promoting a ``signing summit'' at Mar-a-Lago before an agreement has even been inked. Just imagine how that undercuts our negotiators--to say already he is going to sign something when we are eyeball to eyeball with the Chinese. That is not the art of the deal. That is the art of capitulation.  As the Times reported this morning, ``Mr. Trump has grown impatient with the talks, and a consensus is growing in Washington that Mr. Trump will ultimately accept a weak deal.'' Shame on him if he does.  China is robbing and stealing our family jewels: American industrial know-how, American information technology, Americans' ability to do things.  When we are good at it, China doesn't let us in and compete, unless we give them all of the knowledge of how to do it themselves, and China steals our intellectual property. Just 2 weeks ago, there was another hacking--and now we are going to capitulate?  What the Times goes on to say is that ``the Chinese have so far declined to make concrete commitments to reform their economy that the administration has demanded''--these are the words of the New York Times--``including ending China's practice of subsidizing companies, engaging in cyber-theft and forcing American companies to hand over intellectual property to Chinese partners in order to do business there.''  Even our business community does not want the President to capitulate. I met with a bunch of them. They want him to stay strong. Everyone wants him to stay strong. Now he is caving.  This President cannot take a policy and pursue it to its end. His attention span is so small, his desire for immediate gratification seems to be so large that the American worker loses. If we capitulate to China, that American worker will lose for decades. That American worker's children will lose.  So I say to President Trump, it would be a momentous failure if you relent now and don't receive meaningful, enforceable, and verifiable commitments on structural reforms to China's unfair trade policy. Simply buying more soybeans or buying more materials or planes is not going to solve the structural problem, and in a few months China will continue to unfairly gain on us--not right.  So, I wonder, where are all the supposed hawks? Where is Secretary Pompeo on China and North Korea? Where is Ambassador Bolton? Do they feel they can argue internally with the President and he overrules them and that is that? What good is it for them to be there? Oh, yes, they can say: It would have been even worse if we weren't there. That is no way to do policy when either American safety, in regard to North Korea, or American economic prosperity in the future, in regard to China, is at stake.  I believe Ambassador Lighthizer has made a sincere effort to do the right thing on China, but his efforts are constrained by a President who seems intent on weakening his hand every few weeks. Again, where is Bolton? Where is Pompeo? Where are they? They have been hawks on these two issues their whole lives. Now they get in the administration; they just go along, when they were among the loudest critics of President Obama and President Clinton? Not right. Not good for America.  It just so happens that two of President Trump's signature foreign policy issues will come to a head at roughly the same time. There are historic opportunities here to make America safe by removing nuclear weapons from a rogue regime and to end two decades of rapacious Chinese trade policy. We can finally put American companies on a level playing field with our largest competitor. If the President, having brought the Chinese to the table with tough sanctions and tariffs, takes 10 percent or 20 percent of what we can get, that would be very bad for this country, American workers, and American incomes. As they continue to stay flat or decline, one of the main reasons is unfair trade practices by China. We have to be strong and tough. We can win this fight if we can stay strong.  The bottom line is this. If over the course of the 1 month President Trump capitulates to both Beijing and Pyongyang, the foreign policy of his Presidency will be in shambles. It will zig and zag to no real accomplishment. More importantly, the national security and economic security of the American people will greatly suffer as a consequence.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in a document later removed from her website, one of the Green New Deal's sponsors had this to say about the Green New Deal: ``The question isn't how we will pay for it, but what we will do with our new shared prosperity.''  ``The question isn't how we will pay for it . . .'' That was the quote. That is a pretty staggering statement when you consider that the Green New Deal plans to upend most of American society as we know it, from transportation to healthcare, but I suspect there was a simple reason the Green New Deal authors didn't want to talk about how to pay for it--because they couldn't figure out how.  This week, one think tank released a first estimate of what the Green New Deal would cost, and here is the answer: between $51 trillion and $93 trillion over 10 years--between $51 trillion and $93 trillion. Those numbers are so large that they are almost impossible to process.  Just for perspective, consider the fact that the entire Federal budget for 2019 is less than $5 trillion. That is the entire Federal budget--defense spending, domestic priorities, Medicare and Medicaid, Social Security, everything.  The Green New Deal could end up costing $9.3 trillion each year--double the current Federal budget--and the government would still have to pay for a lot of other priorities on top of that. That money wouldn't cover defense spending, or Social Security, or a number of other urgent needs.  The Green New Deal would assuredly raise Americans' energy bills, but that is just a tiny fraction of what Democrats' Green New Deal, which goes far beyond mere energy policy, would cost American families. It is difficult to even imagine the staggering tax hikes that would be required to pay for this plan.  This plan would never be paid for just by taxing the well-off. That is always the argument we hear. Taxing every household making more than $200,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would leave the Democrats far short of $93 trillion. Taxing every family making more than $100,000 a year at a 100-percent rate for 10 years would still leave Democrats far short of $93 trillion. In short, actually implementing this so-called Green New Deal would involve taking money not just from the well-off but from working families in this country--and not a little bit of money either.  Ninety-three trillion dollars breaks down to over $600,000 per household. That is over 10 times the median household income in my State of South Dakota.  Should the Democratic Green New Deal come to pass, ordinary Americans would see incredible tax hikes. Middle-class Americans would see a substantial and permanent reduction in their standard of living.  When we talk about Democrats' socialist fantasies, we tend to quickly fasten on the staggering costs of these programs, but it is important to also remember what else they would cost Americans.  Socialism just doesn't come with a staggering pricetag; it also comes with less freedom, fewer choices, and less control of your own destiny.  Socialized medicine like Medicare for All wouldn't mean just big tax hikes; it would mean giving up your private insurance plan, even if you like your coverage. It would mean being forced onto the government's healthcare plan, whether you like it or not. It would mean waiting in long lines. It would mean long wait times you can't do anything to avoid.  The Green New Deal would mean higher electricity bills and higher taxes, but it would also mean limited transportation choices, including no airplane travel, increased government control over your housing options, less reliable energy, and the list goes on.  Democrats' socialist fantasies would cost Americans untold amounts of money and permanently damage our economy, but the loss of choice and freedom would cost Americans even more. Democrats' green dream would be a green nightmare for Americans and American families.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, if you are a student of history, the speech you just heard is not a new speech. It is a speech that has been given repeatedly in the Senate Chamber. It was back in the 1930s, when a President named Franklin Delano Roosevelt had an idea, and the idea was radical at the time. Here was the radical idea: Shouldn't we allow people, during the course of their work-life, to put a little money away and to invest for their retirement so that when they reach the age of 65, they will have a program called Social Security?  That was considered a radical socialist idea, taking money from everyone to create a positive program to help retirees across America when they reach retirement age. It takes away our freedom, they said. We ought to be able to make our own choices in life. They resisted it, but, fortunately, they failed and in their failure allowed the creation of the Social Security Program, which is the single most popular government program in America today. Over 95 percent of Americans count on Social Security to make sure that when they reach retirement, there is something there to take care of them, but that wasn't the end of the speech you just heard. It was repeated again in the 1960s because another Democratic President by the name of Lyndon Baines Johnson came up with a notion that, perhaps, if people are going to live a little longer and have Social Security, they should also be able to have affordable healthcare. So Lyndon Baines Johnson suggested the creation of Medicare.  What did the critics say about Medicare? Socialism; that you would collect money from people all across America just to provide for the benefits to those who are retired; that you would take away our freedom to make our own savings plans for our future by saying we have to pay into Medicare. It is an attack on our freedom, they said. It is a socialist idea, they said. Thank goodness they lost in that debate as well.  What happened, of course, was a creation of a Medicare Program, and we can see what came about as a result of it, a dramatic increase in the number of hospitals in America and doctors in America. We started taking healthcare seriously when it came to senior citizens. What is the proof in the pudding? Senior citizens started living longer and longer lives. They were healthier, they were independent, they were strong because of this so-called socialist program of Medicare.  So if you listened this morning as Republican leaders came to the floor and decried socialism again, what is their point now? Their point now is, they believe that if we make a national effort toward dealing with climate change and global warming, it is socialism. It takes away our freedom.  I would agree with them in this respect. If we do something as a nation, a sensible approach that is moderate, constructive, and positive, it is going to change the future. It is going to take away the opportunity that some of us will have to leave a planet for our children that is uninhabitable.  Does anyone doubt--does anyone doubt--that we are dealing with some change in the climate that we face around this world? Does anyone doubt that the scientific evidence, year after year after year, about the increased temperature of this planet has had a negative impact on the world we live in--more extreme weather events than we have ever seen, tornadoes in Taylorville, IL, in December?  Listen, I grew up in Illinois. I was awakened many times in the summer to get down in the basement because there was a tornado warning. My parents were worried about it. It was part of growing up in the Midwest, part of growing up in Illinois. I don't recall ever going down to the basement around Christmas. It turns out that tornado season in Illinois, and many other places, is now becoming a year-round event and flooding and fires and flooding in the city of Miami. All of these things are evidence to me that something is going on, and we have the scientific explanation. Greenhouse gas emissions are creating a different environment, warming our planet, changing our weather patterns.  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last several years and asked one basic question, can anyone name any major political party in the world today--any major political party in the world today--that, like the Republican Party of the United States, denies climate change?  I make that open challenge over and over again on the floor and have never had a Republican come to me and say: No, there is another party somewhere that takes our position on the issue that climate change is a fallacy and a fiction. I will tell you, though--maybe I am not supposed to repeat this--but one Republican Senator, after I made that challenge over and over again, drew me aside in the elevator, looked in both directions, and said: I think there is a political party in Australia that also denies climate change. That is as good as it gets--one more party somewhere halfway around the world.  When Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, comes to the floor and challenges the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, with the basic questions, I believe we have the right to ask for an answer.  To the Republicans, to my friend from South Dakota who just spoke, to Senator McConnell of Kentucky, the first question is this: Do you believe that there is such a thing as climate change and global warming? That is a pretty easy question. The scientists overwhelmingly believe it. I do too.  The second question that Senator Schumer has posed to them is this: Do you believe that our human activity has something to do with it? Well, the scientific evidence is overwhelming again. Once we got into the industrial age and starting spewing all of the smoke and chemicals into the air, things started warming up on this planet Earth.  The third question that Senator Schumer has posed to the Republicans is basically fundamental, as well: What are you going to do about it? The answer is obvious. For the 4 years the Republicans have been in control in the Senate, they have done nothing--nothing. Now they have a President who has the United States as the only country in the world--the only Nation on Earth--that has withdrawn from the Paris accord, which tried to create a global strategy to deal with climate change.  The President is enthralled by the notion that climate change is a fallacy, a fiction, and so are the Senate Republicans. So any effort to address this is socialism. Any idea that we should come together as a nation and work toward a planet that our kids can live on is taking away our freedom. Well, we know better.  Under President Obama, we started moving toward more fuel-efficient cars and trucks. A gallon of gas is giving us more mileage because of government policy. Well, I guess it took away the freedom of gas guzzlers, but we can at least say we made a positive step forward, and this administration is stepping backward, and they are doing it for the fossil fuel industry--for oil and gas and coal interests. They are coming to the floor and trying to get us into a fight, once again, over socialism when we talk about government policies that would guide us in the right direction for the future."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to give the first of what may turn out to be many speeches on a subject that affects every single American. The question is the rising cost of prescription drugs in this country.  The first drug that I wanted to address, I wanted to choose carefully because I wanted to choose a drug that really is important to the largest number of Americans. So I thought to myself, what is the most commonly used life-or-death drug in America today? There is some debate about it, but I am going to suggest that it is insulin.  In 1923--almost 100 years ago--researchers were awarded the Nobel Prize for the groundbreaking discovery of insulin to treat diabetes--1923.  The chief scientist in the discovery was Dr. Frederick Banting. He believed that insulin should be accessible to everyone. His team sold the patent to the University of Toronto for $1 so that ``no one could secure a profitable monopoly'' on the production of insulin. That might seem hard to believe today, with the price of insulin having increased more than 600 percent over the past two decades.  Take a look at the chart, which maps the increases in price. Eli Lilly's blockbuster insulin drug, Humalog, was introduced in 1996 at a cost of $21. By 2019, the cost went up to $329.  Sanofi's Lantus was $35 when it came to the market in 2001. It now costs $270. The insulin drug, NovoLog, cost $40 in 2001. By 2018, it went up to $289--for insulin.  How many Americans are affected by this? There are 30 million Americans who live with type 1 or type 2 diabetes--almost 10 percent of our population. Approximately 7.5 million of them rely on insulin to manage their blood sugar levels. It is a matter of life and death. Yet patients are suffering because of these dramatic price spikes.  A recent study found that one-quarter of patients who rely on insulin have been forced to ration their doses due to cost, basically in contravention of the advice of their doctors.  This is a story that many of us have heard here. Last year, we heard from the mother of Alec Raeshawn Smith. He went off his mom's health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, he could remain covered until he reached the age of 26. He had diabetes. He had coverage for his insulin until he reached the age of 26. Then he couldn't afford to buy health insurance. So when he went off of that insurance, he was faced with the monthly cost of his insulin out of pocket. That monthly cost was $1,000.  He managed a little restaurant, and he couldn't come up with $1,000. So he decided that he would ration his insulin and not take as much as was required by his doctor, trying to make it last between paychecks. Alec died as a result of that decision.  How is it that in the richest country on Earth, patients are having to ration their insulin or start GoFundMe websites just to survive?  Insulin was a cure found in the 20th century that patients now cannot afford in the 21st century. Pharma's war on patients with diabetes must come to an end.  Yesterday, there was a hearing, widely televised, where seven or eight of the CEOs of major pharmaceutical companies faced the music before the Senate Finance Committee. Senator Grassley, Senator Wyden, and many others asked questions about the issue I am raising today: What is going on? Why are you raising prices so high? There were no good answers coming from these executives.  Today, I am going to start highlighting on the floor of the Senate the egregious cases of pharmaceutical greed in the United States.  Years ago, there was a Senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire. He was an unusual man. He was far different than most Senators today. He was the type of fellow who would show up at the University of Wisconsin games, passing out cards. That was his style of campaigning. He didn't spend a lot of money on television and radio.  He really was a grassroots politician, and he was a tenacious fellow. He started something called the Golden Fleece Award--Proxmire of Wisconsin's Golden Fleece Award. Once a month or more, he would come to the floor and talk about waste--taxpayer waste--in our Federal Government. It developed a national reputation.  In deference to Senator Proxmire, whom I had a chance to meet when I was a college student, I am going to try to follow in his tradition by pointing out egregious examples of greed by the pharmaceutical industry in the United States on a regular basis with the Pharma Fleece Award.  My first Pharma Fleece Award is for the pharmaceutical industry's extortion of 7.5 million diabetic patients in America who depend on insulin. This is a lifesaving product that has been around for almost a century.  How can the most common life-and-death drug be so expensive? First, the United States is an outlier. The same companies I am talking about sell exactly the same drug in other countries around the world for a fraction of the cost.  The United States represents only 15 percent of all of the global insulin market; yet we generate more than half--more than 50 percent--of Pharma's revenue for this drug.  How can Lantus cost $372 in the United States? The exact same drug made by the same company costs $46 in France and $67 in Canada. Why? Why are we paying five, six, and seven times more in the United States for exactly the same drug? It is because the governments of France and Canada care about the cost, and they say to the company Sanofi, in this case, that makes Lantus: If you want to sell Lantus in Canada, we are not going to let you hike the prices and raise them to the high heavens. We are going to keep the prices reasonable so that the people of Canada can afford this lifesaving drug. What do we do in the United States? Nothing. We let them charge whatever they wish.  How can Lantus cost $372 for Americans, while the same, exact drug for the French is $46, and just across the border, in Canada, it is $67?  Our problem is that our system doesn't function as a free market. There is virtually no competition. Three companies control the insulin supply in America: Eli Lilly, Sanofi, and Novo Nordisk.  Typically, in a free market, three competitors would lower the prices, wouldn't they? But in America, these three charge as much as they can and get away with it because they are protected by government-granted monopolies.  We should reward innovation, we should promote research, and we should ensure that companies do make a profit for their good work, but abusive manufacturers should not be protected from competition by our government.  Lantus has been on the market since the year 2000. Sanofi has received 49 secondary patents on insulin. What does that mean? They have created a fortress around this lucrative drug for a 37-year monopoly in offering this drug for sale in America.  Unfortunately, there is no effective deterrent today against Big Pharma's greed and price gouging on these and so many other drugs. That is why, earlier this month, I introduced a bill called the Forcing Limits on Abusive and Tumultuous Prices Act, or FLAT Prices Act. This legislation will discourage and deter the pharmaceutical industry from raising prices by reducing the government monopoly periods when they do.  You see, companies are awarded monopoly periods from 5 to 12 years by the Food and Drug Administration for drug approval beyond the patent protection. My FLAT Prices Act would reduce this FDA-granted exclusivity period for a drug whose price increases more than 10 percent a year, bringing generic competitors into the marketplace, creating real competition, and trying to lower prices for Americans.  That brings us to another issue. Today, there remains no generic, no biosimilar insulin that can be substituted in a pharmacy. Think about it. Almost a century after the discovery of human insulin and even half a century after the discovery of synthetic and analog insulin, we still don't have a generic insulin for sale in America that is affordable.  I will acknowledge that these changes in insulin have improved the quality of life for patients. They have made them safer, more effective, and more convenient, but these changes have delayed the development of generic substitutes.  There are other reasons the FDA has regulated insulin as a drug rather than as a biologic, placing insulin under a framework with a much higher bar than generics to prove they are substitutes. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--the Food and Drug Administration is supposed to be shifting its regulatory process for insulin to enable copycat versions, known as biosimilars, to be approved quickly. Unfortunately, FDA's plan to implement this law will not bring relief to patients any time soon.  I do believe that the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner, Dr. Gottlieb, truly wants to lower costs and spur competition. I wasn't convinced when his nomination came up for a vote, but I have had subsequent conversations with him, and I think he is genuine. I think he wants to see the prices come down.  However, the Food and Drug Administration's current plan will effectively freeze the approval process for lower cost insulin and force generic insulin makers who are under review to resubmit their new applications each year.  This creates a 2-year lockup where it is unlikely that any new insulin competitors will come to market. America's diabetic patients cannot wait.  That is why Senator Cramer, a Republican from North Dakota, and I are sending a letter urging the Food and Drug Administration to revise and bring flexibility to this process so we can get the lower cost insulin on the market approved sooner.  Two weeks ago, I received a little note from a constituent in Mount Vernon, IL. That is downstate, near where my father was born. He wrote that both he and his daughter had been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 1997. At that time, their Humalog insulin cost $10. Today, he writes that the cost is $300 a bottle, and he needs six bottles a month.  His monthly costs have risen from $600 to $1,800. Here is what he said in this letter:       At some point, drug companies must be held to account for      the actions they are taking. These cost increases are costing      American citizens to choose between insulin and eating in      many cases. I'm tired of listening to all the excuses. . . .      what is it going to take for Congress to do its job?  I agree with my constituent. Congress needs to step up and demand real change. The sky-high cost of life-or-death insulin is literally killing Americans.  My work with Senator Cramer to speed FDA approval of lower cost insulin and my bill to shorten monopolies for abusive pharma companies are a start. This pharma fleecing of insulin patients across America must end.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today on the floor by my colleagues to discuss the unprecedented levels of obstruction aimed at President Trump's nominees. This issue plagued the 115th Congress, and it is one I am hopeful we can remedy moving forward in this new session.  The Senate is tasked with the critical role of providing advice and consent on many of the President's nominations, including executive branch officials and Federal judges. Vetting these officials is a task that I take extremely seriously, and I have often welcomed discussion regarding these critical appointments with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as my constituents.  We can all agree that these positions must be filled by our Nation's most qualified candidates, individuals who are committed to public service and upholding the values and principles that make our Nation so great. We should also be able to agree that these positions should be filled using an expedient and timely process.  As any Iowa small business owner can tell you, if you don't have employees, you can't function. Iowans and many others across this Nation expect the Federal Government to run on the same commonsense principle.  The recent levels of obstruction for the President's nominees have not only kept the executive branch and our Federal courts from staffing critical positions but have also prevented the Senate from moving forward on other critical legislative priorities and initiatives.  In the past, the Senate has been able to disagree on certain nominations and still move forward in a respectful and expedient manner to ensure that the Federal Government operates efficiently. However, during President Trump's first Congress, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have utilized a series of procedural tactics to eat up time on the Senate floor and to stall the President's nominees.  To put this in perspective, during President George W. Bush's first Congress, the Senate forced a cloture vote on nominations only 4 times. That was during President Bush's first Congress. So it was 4 times.  During President Clinton's first Congress, this increased to a mere 8 cloture votes--8 cloture votes for Clinton.  During President Obama's first Congress, the use of this tactic still remained minimal, with only 12 cloture votes on nominations. So it was Bush, 4; Clinton, 8; and President Obama, 12.  Compare that to the use of cloture votes during the 115th Congress. My Democratic colleagues forced cloture votes 128 times--128 times. That is 10 times more often than during President Obama's first Congress.  Despite that President Trump submitted nearly the same number of nominees as President Obama, 29 percent more Obama nominees than Trump nominees were confirmed during each President's respective first Congress. Yet these delays have often not been used to raise objections to controversial or unqualified nominees. That is just not the case.  In fact, nearly half of all recorded cloture votes--48 percent, to be exact--received 60 or more votes to end debate. Furthermore, nearly a third received 70 or more votes to end debate. These nominees were confirmed with widespread bipartisan support.  Cloture was not invoked in order to extensively debate the merits or the qualifications of those candidates. Instead, this procedural tactic has been used to run down the clock and prevent the Senate from moving forward with other important business.  Many nominees from my home State of Iowa have been fortunate enough to escape some of these political games. I was proud to see the Senate reach an agreement in September to move forward and confirm Judge C.J. Williams to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa by a 79-to-12 vote. I am also glad that multiple U.S. marshals and U.S. attorneys have been able to fill critical Federal law enforcement positions in Iowa after being confirmed by a voice vote in the Senate.  However, while many of these positions have been filled back in my home State, Iowans are still greatly harmed when the Senate fails to efficiently fill executive branch positions whose duties do impact the entire Nation.  Furthermore, many States across our Nation have faced unnecessary challenges to filling critical positions after cloture was invoked for noncontroversial nominees.  Take a State like Alabama, for example. Judge Annemarie Carney Axon received bipartisan support from both of her home State Senators for her nomination to serve on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. However, Democrats forced a cloture vote on her nomination before confirming her by a vote of 83 to 11.  Similarly, Judge Terry Doughty was confirmed to be a judge on the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana by a 98-to-0 vote after a forced cloture vote.  These are not isolated examples. Just last year, multiple district judge nominees in Kentucky and Texas received the support of more than 90 Senators, but only after their nomination was first stalled, again, by an unnecessary cloture vote.  We cannot continue to allow the Senate to be bogged down by unprecedented obstruction tactics. The American people expect and deserve a fully functioning government with the right personnel in place.  That is why I want to thank Leader McConnell for continuing to make nominations such a priority and managing to confirm so many Federal judges, despite these tactics. I also thank my colleagues, Senators Blunt and Lankford, for introducing a proposal that accelerates the nomination process for lower level nominees.  This commonsense proposal builds on the previous Reid-Schumer rule affecting Senate considerations of Obama nominees during the 113th Congress--a rule that garnered widespread bipartisan support, including the agreement of 35 of my Democratic colleagues who still serve in the Senate today.  I urge my colleagues to support this reasonable proposal that enables us to move forward in a timely manner while still encouraging input and debate on those candidates. It is time for the Senate to put a halt to these delay tactics and get back to fulfilling our commitments to the American people. Again, I urge support of the proposal.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, maybe the fastest way to put people to sleep is to give a speech on cloture here in the Senate, but I hope that is not the case, because, as my colleague from Iowa just pointed out, this is an abuse of the Senate rules to do nothing but to obstruct and to slow down President Trump's well-qualified nominees for important positions.  This is not about their qualifications. This is not about exercising the constitutional responsibility of advice and consent. In virtually every instance in which the clock has been burned to get to an eventual vote, these largely noncontroversial nominees have been confirmed overwhelmingly.  Call it part of the ``Trump derangement'' syndrome or the ``never Trump'' effort. It is very clear to me that rather than take these nominees one at a time, treat them fairly, assess their qualifications, and vote on their nomination, these people are being delayed and denied an opportunity to serve, and many of them have just simply given up because of the backlog of nominations. It is unfair to them, it is unfair to this administration, and it is completely an abuse of the Senate rules.  We know that our Democratic colleagues have unnecessarily blocked nominees, put them through the ringer in hearings, and, in one particular case--the Kavanaugh nomination--engaged in an all-out smear campaign.  This treatment has grabbed headlines, but the story that doesn't get much attention is what I want to talk about now--this practice of eating up time on the floor, using every second of the rules to essentially eliminate the possibility that we can take up other bipartisan legislation or consider these nominees on any sort of efficient and effective basis.  As a result of the work, these nominees are being denied an opportunity to serve, the floor is being occupied by nominations that are uncontroversial, and we are unable to get to other important work that the American people want us to do.  Now, it is true that the Senate is not known for speed, and, more often than not, there is a good reason. When we are appropriating taxpayer dollars or debating sanctions on hostile governments or negotiating changes to our healthcare system, speed is not always an asset.  But when it comes to confirming nominees--those who already have had a hearing, who aren't controversial, who have already received a vote in committee--the process should be able to move rather quickly and efficiently.  But, as I said, this is part of a concerted effort to undermine the Trump administration, to deny them the appointees necessary for them to conduct the Nation's business, and, in many instances, these are Ambassadors who should be representing the United States of America in foreign countries where it is important we maintain good communication with those other countries.  Over the last 2 years, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have forced votes on nominees who in previous years would have sailed through the Senate.  Let's look at some of these numbers. You can see how much red there is on this chart--cloture votes in the first Congress. President Trump had 128 cloture votes, President Obama had 12, President Bush had 4, and President Clinton had 8. What that means is that, for example, in the Clinton administration, there were 120 nominees who were confirmed without the necessity of even going through the procedure of cloture. Frequently, these nominees are either passed by voice vote or unanimous consent or at some agreed upon time. Even fewer required a cloture vote under President George W. Bush. There were 12 under President Obama and 128 under President Trump. If we were to continue down this same path, we would not be able to do anything else except consider nominations by this President, and we still wouldn't get to the end of the list.  Our Democratic colleagues don't want to hold votes on these nominees to support or oppose a nomination; they simply want to waste the Senate's time and to test the patience of the American people. The majority of these nominees, as I said, aren't controversial. Nearly half received the support of 60 or more Senators during the cloture vote, and more than one-third got 70-plus votes.  As I said, the delay and obstruction have led to a long list of vacancies across every Department and Agency. Critical leadership positions have gone unfulfilled while the nominees await confirmation votes from the Senate. As I said, many have simply given up, unwilling to accept any more disruption in their personal lives in the vain hope that perhaps someday, somehow, they will get a vote in the Senate. This list includes Ambassadors, Federal judges, Under Secretaries, Assistant Secretaries, and inspectors general. The list continues to grow while our Democratic colleagues insist on votes that will not change the outcome.  It is one thing to have a nominee whose qualifications are controversial or where a debate would enlighten the Members of the Senate on how best to cast their vote, but that is not what is happening here.  Despite our repeated pleas for Democrats to cooperate, things aren't going to change. That is why the rules change we are contemplating is so important. It would expedite the process for many nominees to receive a vote on the floor. It won't change the number of votes they need to get confirmed--they will still need to get a majority of votes--or tilt the scale in their favor in any way; it will simply make sure we are not wasting time that is not being used in order to delay or defeat nominations.  Ironically, we have been told by our Senate colleagues on the other side that if we were to pass a rule limiting the postcloture time to 2 hours and we would start it in 2021, at the end of President Trump's current term of office, they would vote for it. So this is really an unprincipled and nakedly partisan approach, because while they are willing to do it for the next President--and that could well be a second Trump term, or it could well be another President--they won't do it now, which demonstrates the hypocrisy they are exhibiting.  What would happen is, a nominee would get a hearing in front of the appropriate committee. That would be debated, and there would be a vote up or down. If the nominee was passed out of the committee and made available to come to the floor, the Senate majority leader could still file a paper asking for a cloture vote. If that was obtained, then the postcloture time would be reduced from 30 hours to 2 hours. In the meantime, there would be an intervening day during which debate would occur. Every Senator would still enjoy the right to vote against any nominee they don't support, but to just burn time for time's sake is an abuse of the Senate rules and needs to stop. It is not just hurting these nominees; it is not just hurting the Senate; it is hurting the country. These Ambassadors, judges, and appointed officials who serve in the State Department, the Department of Defense, and the inspectors general who make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent legally and efficiently and that people are doing their jobs--none of those positions are able to be filled.  I would point out that this rule change does not apply to all nominees. High-level Cabinet positions and Supreme Court Justices would still receive the 30 hours of debate time after 51 Senators have voted to proceed to that vote.  It is important to note that this type of rules change isn't new. Actually, in 2013, there was a negotiated, bipartisan standing rule when Majority Leader Harry Reid and the current Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, introduced a similar change to speed up the process, and this simply builds on the foundation they laid down. So if we asked them to do now what was done then on a bipartisan basis, their answer will be no--for no good reason other than it is President Trump who would presumably benefit from this restoration of that same process.  As I said, the real hypocrisy of their position is indicated by the fact that they said they would vote for this rule, but they don't want it to take effect now. They want it to take effect in 2021. In short, they appear to believe that what we are trying to do is an important rules change to make, but they don't want to do it if it benefits a President they clearly despise.  This political theater is being orchestrated by Senate Democrats and is impacting our ability to carry out our constitutional duty of advice and consent. I believe this is a necessary step to get the Senate back on track, and I will support this rules change when it comes to the floor for a vote and would encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today as one of a number of our colleagues to talk about something that really bothers me. We are seeing historic obstructionism in the Senate today. It has been going on for the last 2 years.  One of the fundamental responsibilities in the Senate is to provide advice and consent on Presidential nominations. When President Trump took office, he acted with urgency to fill positions in his administration with highly qualified and highly skilled, experienced individuals from the real world--not just people from the bubble but people from America. Unfortunately, Democrats have slow-walked this confirmation process every step of the way. In my view, this is historic obstructionism, and it needs to stop.  This is the first time in U.S. history that the minority party has not waived the 30-hour debate rule to this degree. As a result, of the 1,200 nominees to be confirmed by any new President, only 714 have been confirmed to date. At the end of last year, because of this historic Democratic obstructionism, we had 386 nominations in line waiting to be confirmed. At the end of Obama's first 2 years, only 5 nominees were outstanding, compared to the 386 for President Trump at the end of last year.  Let me say that again. At the end of President Obama's first 2 years, only five nominees had not been confirmed. That means that out of everybody he sent to the Senate, only five at that point had not been confirmed. However, at the end of December this past year, President Trump still had 386 nominees in the pipeline right here in the U.S. Senate, waiting for us to get to them.  Of the last three Presidents, we have collectively only had 24 cloture votes required by the minority party--only 24. However, during President Trump's first 2 years, Democrats forced 128 cloture votes on nominees on the Senate floor. Each one of these cloture votes requires 30 hours of debate. We can't do anything else on the floor while we are doing that. That means the normal business of the Senate cannot be transacted because we are waiting, due to the 30-hour debate rule, to get to the vote. Basically, under those realities, the Senate is able to do only one confirmation per week. Do the math--386 weeks is a long time.  What is going on here has nothing to do with the nominees' qualifications, either. Every single one of Donald Trump's nominees who received a recorded vote was passed. Not one has failed to pass in this body--not one. The vast majority of these nominees are noncontroversial and get more than 70 or 80 votes and in some cases more than that.  This chart shows that of the cloture votes we have had to take, 48 percent got more than 60 votes, and 37 percent got more than 70. That means 70 percent of the nominees got more than 60 votes. These are not controversial nominees. That is not the issue.  My own cousin, who is now Secretary of Agriculture, waited 4 months. I know this personally because he bunked in my place for 4 months while we were waiting to get his confirmation. When he finally got to the floor of the Senate, he got 87 votes.  It is clear that the Democrats will stop at nothing to obstruct the Senate from working on real issues. Every hour we have to spend in the 30-hour waiting period is time we can't utilize to take up the country's business and the priorities Americans want us to be working on. If this obstruction continues, President Trump will not have his full team in place until the end of his second term.  These delays are petty, and the American people have had enough. I hear about it every time I go home.  For the last 2 years, several of my colleagues and I have pushed to keep the Senate in session during the traditional August State work break in order to confirm nominees and make progress on funding the Federal Government. In August of 2017, the leader of the majority party, Senator McConnell, agreed to keep us here for the month of August in order to work on several things we were working on, including confirming these nominees. The minority party agreed, after 4 days, to basically confirm 77 nominees on that one day. What makes that important is that prior to that time in August, in all of that year, we had only been able to get 44 nominees confirmed. While staying here last August, in 2018, we confirmed 43 nominees and completed 75 percent of the government funding bills.  As I speak today, there are 249 nominees before the U.S. Senate waiting to be confirmed. Basically, that would require 249 weeks to do if we follow the rule we have been following over the last 2 years. These nominees include the Assistant Secretary of Readiness for the Department of Defense, who has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 months. This is in the Department of Defense, the Assistant Secretary for Readiness--one of the crisis areas we have in our military. For 8 months this nominee has been waiting to be confirmed. The Under Secretary for Food Safety in the Department of Agriculture--one I hear a lot about--has been waiting 9 months in line to be confirmed.  The people on the other side are saying: The President is just not sending up nominees fast enough.  Well, what happens with these folks who have been sitting here for 9 months waiting to be confirmed?  The Assistant Secretary for Economic Development at the Department of Commerce has been waiting to be confirmed for 8 months.  These are not low-level nominees; these are Assistant Secretaries who are waiting to be confirmed.  This has to stop. This President is not even able to form his own Cabinet in complete terms because these Assistant Secretaries are not in place. We should be working around-the-clock to get these people confirmed.  If this obstructionism continues, we should try to change the existing rules for confirming nominees by reducing the 30-hour debate rule at minimum. There is a plan in the Senate right now that would reduce the 30 hours of debate to 8 hours for most and 2 hours for some. Reducing the debate time required would speed up the confirmation process and allow us to focus on other business in the Senate that people want us to address. Every single Democrat in the Senate today who was also here in 2013 supported reducing debate time on nominees, and they should do so again right now.  I will close by saying that despite this historic obstructionism, the Senate has, indeed, over the last 2 years--because we focused on this as a priority, even with this 30-hour debate rule being enacted--we confirmed 63 district court judges, 31 circuit court of appeals justices, and two Supreme Court Justices. These judges will have an impact on the judiciary for years to come.  By the way, these are not activists with political agendas or motives. They are accomplished, experienced jurists, dedicated to upholding the Constitution and adhering to the rule of law. It is criminal that we waited that long to get these people confirmed.  I applaud the President for nominating such outstanding individuals to these positions. If this historic obstructionism continues in the Senate, I believe President Trump will not have his full team in place until the end of his second term, if then. This obstruction needs to end. The resistance movement threatens the security of our country and our ability to deal with the problems facing America today. It is time to rise above this partisan gridlock, change the rules, confirm these nominees, and finally begin to get results for the American people.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":" Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the IRS and tax issues and the tax bill last year, but following on what Senator Perdue said, I want to, first of all, compliment him for not only this speech but several times he has talked about how the Senate has stalled time after time on nominees.  I want to bring to my colleagues' attention that at one time, there was a lot of concern by President Obama that his nominees were not being confirmed fast enough. We started hearing that in January 2013. All of a sudden, there was a feeling that we ought to have a bipartisan solution to this issue to speed along President Obama's nominees. At one time, the Democratic leader then was talking about using a nuclear option to accomplish a change in rules. Both Republicans and Democrats thought that wasn't a very good idea, so Republicans and Democrats got together and agreed to reduce postcloture debate time for the rest of the 113th Congress, although, before that Congress ended, Senator Reid decided to use the nuclear option anyway, and he did that at a later time.  If Republicans and Democrats could get together in the 113th Congress to speed up the time and have less postcloture debate time, why can't we do it now? The problem, of course, is for the Trump nominees being held up in the Senate, the time is far worse than it was under President Obama or, for that matter, any other President before that.  It seems to me, as we are talking about changing the post-debate time again--because there is a resolution out of our Rules Committee--I think it is about time that we think that what is good for the goose is good for the gander, and we ought to reinstate that bipartisan agreement. I hope we can get the support of Democrats to do that like they had the support of Republicans to do that when we had a Democratic President.  I thank Senator Perdue for what he spoke about on a longer basis than I just did, but I want to back him up fully. Mr. President, we are in the fifth week of the tax filing season. Based on all reports from the IRS, the filing season is running smoothly. All systems are operating as expected. Returns are being processed and refunds are being sent out without any major complications.  According to IRS Commissioner Rettig, his Agency has even set a couple of internal records for the speed at which returns are being processed. At one point, the IRS processed 1.9 million returns in an hour. That is 536 every single second.  Of course, you don't hear much about how the filing season is running smoothly from our mainstream press. There is a lot of positive news, but positive news doesn't seem to make good headlines. Instead, an obsession has developed around the size of the tax returns, not the exact tax that might actually be paid.  Let's set aside that the available Treasury data is merely in the first few weeks of a very unusual tax season due to the partial government shutdown. Never mind that the size of the average tax refund can vary greatly from week to week, making year-over-year comparisons early in the filing season essentially meaningless. Let's ignore the important fact that less than half as many child tax credits and earned-income tax credits have been issued as compared to the last year based almost entirely on calendar factors, and, most importantly, we ought to somehow forget about the fact that the size of one's tax refund tells you absolutely nothing about a taxpayers' overall tax return.  I have been amazed by how many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, who should know better, have sought to equate incomplete information about lower average refunds--telling us all that means people have not received a decrease in their taxes.  I want to quote Howard Gleckman, who should be well respected by people on the other side of the aisle because he is a senior fellow at the liberal Tax Policy Center. He characterized the current obsession with tax refunds as ``wrong-headed,'' noting that it is ``not how big a refund check filers get this year but how much total tax they paid for 2018.'' That is common sense. I thank Howard Gleckman for his common sense.  Yet my colleagues--again, on the other side--continue to try and push the false narrative that a smaller refund is synonymous with tax increase. That doesn't meet the commonsense test.  Just such a claim by a Senate Democrat running for President was observed by the Washington Post's Fact Checker as being ``nonsensical and misleading.'' The claim was awarded four Pinocchios. Four Pinocchios is a rating the Post reserves for the biggest whoppers.  Here are the straight facts. Anyone telling the American public that a smaller refund is the same as a tax increase is being intentionally misleading and doing a disservice to the public. I classify that as a big lie. The size of one's tax refund merely reflects what that taxpayer overpaid the IRS in your paychecks last year. For the vast majority of Americans, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of December 2017 delivered larger paychecks starting last February. The liberal Tax Policy Center confirms that 90 percent of middle-income taxpayers will receive a tax cut. That is right. Taxes went down, not up, for the vast majority of American families.  This tax relief stems from the combination of pro-middle-class and pro-family provisions, including a nearly doubled standard deduction, an increase in the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000, and overall lower tax rates. That is how you give the middle class a tax cut.  Some may believe that we would have been better off depriving taxpayers of their tax cuts until the IRS sent them a refund after the end of the year, but this thinking gets things exactly backward. The excess tax withheld from paychecks throughout the course of a year doesn't belong to the government; it belongs to the taxpayers who earned that money. It is the taxpayers who should be able to decide whether they want to put their weekly or monthly tax savings in a retirement account, pay down a credit card bill, enroll their children in some club, sport, music, or dance lessons, or maybe even make an extra car payment.  I encourage all taxpayers interested in how tax reform affects their bottom line to compare this year's tax return with last year's tax return. That is the commonsense way of figuring out whether your taxes went up or down as a result of the tax bill of 2017. When they do that, the vast majority will see less of their hard-earned money being sent to Washington, DC. Really, that is what ought to matter.  I encourage those in the media who are actually interested in how tax reform has affected taxpayers to take into account the positive signs we see all around. It is a positive sign when we write about how blue-collar employment has surged; positive signs about how low-income workers experienced the highest wage growth in a decade; positive signs when we report how new business startups are climbing and how U.S. manufacturers had their best year since 1997; and positive signs as you discuss how the economy grew almost 50 percent faster in 2018 than as President Obama's economists predicted when they predicted slow growth would be the new normal.  All of these subjects are far more important than what has thus far, in most all respects, been an uneventful filing season. Compare this year's tax bottom line with last year's tax bottom line to decide whether you got a tax decrease or a tax increase, not the size of your refund.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, 2 years ago, I came to this floor of the Senate to talk about the rules process and nominations in particular because, even 2 years ago, we were experiencing the beginning of what I saw to be a trend.  When elected to office, every President has about 1,200 nominations that have to come through the Senate for what is called advice and consent. Those individuals go through background checks at the White House, they go through interviews through the White House, and they go through the extensive review of references. Then they are recommended to the respective committees here, where they again go through background checks, have conversations, interviews, public hearings, questions for the record after the hearings are over, and go through any followup from any individual American who wants to give input whether that input be from outside groups here or from anywhere else in the country. Then they come to the floor of the Senate.  In the past, those individuals moved through quickly because there were 1,200 of them, but the minority has always had the right to have one last, little slowdown when they have gotten to the floor. They can make what is called a cloture vote request. The minority--any individual--could always make a request for a cloture vote to say: I know they have gone through all of these extensive checks, that they have already passed the committee, that they have gone through all of the process, but at the end, I want an additional 30 hours of debate on these people. Yet it is not just 30 hours of debate; it is actually what is called a full intervening day. After that, there is an additional 30 hours of debate for that person.  That has been done in the past but very rarely in the first 2 years of a Presidency because there are so many nominations that have to go through the process. If we go back to President Clinton, there were eight of those requests. For President Bush, there were four of those. For President Obama, there were 12 of those. For President Trump, there have been 128 of those.  Two years ago, I saw the trend of where this was heading. This was a new structure for the beginning of a Presidency. I was concerned at that time, but I have an even greater concern now. It is the trend of where we are headed as a Senate. Is this going to be the new normal? This used to be what was normal: Occasional nominees would come through if they were very controversial. Yet most of these nominees were not really all that controversial. In fact, 48 percent of those nominees who had the additional cloture time then got more than 60 votes. In fact, 37 percent of them got more than 70 votes. These were not controversial individuals coming through; it was just an intentional slowing down of the process.  I have heard folks say: There are so many of these judges who are coming through at the district court level that they become very controversial.  Quite frankly, every single judge who comes through has to be approved by the two Senators from that State through what is called the blue-slip process. This is for all of those district court judges. It is a process that has been honored by previous administrations and by this administration. This Senate has honored those same blue slips for all of the district court judges. If the judges are from a Democratic State, both of those Democratic Senators have to approve of them before they come. If the judges are from a State that has one Democrat and one Republican, it has to be split. If there are two Republicans, they both have to agree to it. This is for all of the district court judges. Yet they are still being slowed down. They have gone through the background checks, and they have been approved by their home State Senators regardless of party; yet they are slowed down.  So whether they are executive nominees or whether they are judicial nominees, these 128 individuals being slowed down has created a new slowdown in the Senate.  Two years ago, I made a proposal to go back to something that Harry Reid proposed and was passed by this Senate in 2013, which was long before I was here. It was a 2-year agreement to just say: Here is how we are going to deal with what is called postcloture debate time. If there is a controversial nominee, here is how we will handle it.  I went to my colleagues and said: Let's revive that rule. Instead of making it for 2 years, which was the Harry Reid rule, let's just make it from here on out. I made that proposal in the last Senate. We took that to the Rules Committee. It passed the Rules Committee, but it could not pass on this floor.  I thought it was eminently kind and bipartisan to say that I would go back and grab Harry Reid's rule and that if it was good for the Democrats when they were in the leadership, it should be good for everybody regardless of whether it is the Republicans or the Democrats. It did not pass.  I have once again come back and made a proposal to say let's fix this and to not just fix this for now but to fix this from here on out. Whether there will be a Democratic President or a Republican President in the future, let's have a simple rule: If we get to a nominee who has gone through the background checks of the White House, has gone through the committee and passed the committee, and has gone through additional questions for the record--all of that--if people still want additional time, they can still request the intervening day, but then instead of 30 hours after that full day, it would be just 2 hours of additional time.  Quite frankly, during most of the time that we have had the 30 hours of debate, there hasn't really been debate on the floor for 30 hours; there has been debate on the floor for, say, 15 or 20 minutes. For the rest of the time, the floor has sat empty or we have debated other things other than the nominee.  So we would set aside 2 additional hours. We would do this for district court judges, and we would do this for most of the nominees for the executive branch, but we would still hold that 30 hours for things like nominees for the circuit court, the Supreme Court, and those at the Cabinet level. For those types of positions, sure, keep the 30 hours, but for the other 1,000-plus nominees who are to be the Deputy Secretaries or assistants of whatever it may be, allow them to go through the normal process and not slow it down.  The Chief Counsel for the IRS has not been confirmed. He went through the last Congress, but he didn't get there. He passed 25 to 2 out of committee. He passed 26 to 2 out of committee this time; yet there is a requirement of 30 additional hours of debate on the floor. He will probably pass overwhelmingly, but it is just a tactic to slow down this floor.  We have a lot of business to do. Let's make a rule that is fair, and let's make it work for everyone. My concern is, long-term for the Senate, this will be the new trend, and the next time there is a Democratic President, this is what Republicans will do to Democratic Presidents, and this will be the new way that we operate.  This isn't helpful for any President; this isn't helpful for the Senate; and this is something we need to fix.  We have 2 years of muscle memory on this now--of doing it over and over and over. I don't think this gets better because I think the political pressure will be there just to keep doing this and slowing things down for everybody.  So we put a rule out there. It has gone through the Rules Committee. I have encouraged my Democratic colleagues to join in with this because there will be a Democratic President someday in the future, and they will not want this coming back at them and will say this is unfair, and I will agree. But it will happen, so let's fix it now. Let's resolve this in this Senate in this time from here on out--not a short-term rule but long-term, permanent--to take us back to this being the norm, when we could work better together.  I love hearing everyone say that we should be more bipartisan as a body. I would love to get this body working again. That is this proposal. This proposal is not a partisan proposal. It is not trying to get leverage on anybody. It is trying to get this body back to working again, and I hope in the weeks ahead, when this rule actually comes to the floor of the Senate, we can get overwhelming bipartisan support for it so that we can get back to working together.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a vote that we will be having in just a few minutes on the process of moving Andrew Wheeler forward as the EPA Administrator.  This is not a time for talk; it is not time for theoretical debates. This is certainly not the time for an EPA Administrator who, during his time at the EPA, has ignored climate scientists, rolled back climate regulations, and taken action that will lead to more carbon pollution.  Instead, this is a time for bold, decisive action. We need to act today because life on our planet depends on it. The fate of our Nation depends on it. Our children's and grandchildren's futures depend on it.  For those reasons, I cannot support Andrew Wheeler for the critical position of EPA Administrator.  Climate change is real. In fact, it is more than real. It is an existential crisis, and it is already having real impact on Michigan families and Michigan's economy.  Some call it global warming. Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist from Texas Tech, has a better term. She call calls it ``global weirding.'' Ask anybody in Michigan. Things have been weird.  Our lakes are heating up. In fact, Lake Superior is getting about 2 degrees warmer each decade. That could make the lake a happy home for invasive species, like sea lamprey.  As the waters warm, these parasites grow and kill off more trout and salmon and other fish that are key to the Great Lakes' $8 billion recreational fishing industry. It is believed that warmer temperatures contributed to algal blooms on the lake last summer.  Other changes we are seeing are life-threatening.  Thanks to the polar vortex in January, Michigan experienced temperatures colder than Antarctica. Scientists believe that climate change has caused the jet stream to become wobbly--that is a technical term, ``wobbly''--pushing dangerously frigid air south.  Folks say: Well, how can it be global warming when we see the polar vortex? It is about what is happening to destabilize the atmosphere and the planet and the changes that are occurring.  Last weekend, a bomb cyclone hit my State, leaving tens of thousands of Michigan residents without power.  We are having to come up with new terms. I had never heard of a bomb cyclone--60-mile-an-hour winds, ripping up homes and farms and roadways.  The intensity of what is happening is incredible. The travel was so treacherous in Otsego County that all roads were closed--all of the roads were closed. Even drivers on Interstate 75 were getting stuck in drifts. That is our major highway.  We can't link any specific storm to climate change. However, we do know that overall climate change is making storms more intense. They are longer. They are more intense. They are happening more frequently with more intensity.  Last summer in Houghton County, more than 5 and a half inches of rain fell in 6 hours. It caused at least $100 million in damage to infrastructure, and a 12-year-old-boy died when the basement of his home collapsed.  Our climate is changing, but you don't have to take my word for it. Just ask insurance company executives. Their companies paid out a record $135 billion--billion dollars--from natural disasters in 2017 alone. That is almost three times as much as the historic annual average, and their projections show it getting worse.  We need to take action on climate change. While it is not widely recognized, I want to speak about something positive that we have done, and that was last year's farm bill.  As you know, the farm bill passed the Senate with a vote of 87 to 13--the most votes in history. While the bill was historic for a number of reasons, one of those is that it includes the most ambitious Federal climate-smart agricultural and forestry policies to date, working with farmers and ranchers as partners.  It helps farmers implement climate-smart policies by revamping USDA conservation programs to prioritize investments in soil carbon sequestration, incentivizing the planting of cover crops, and expanding USDA support for farmer participation in carbon markets.  It also invests in the Rural Energy for America Program, which helps farmers and rural small businesses install renewable energy systems and creates a joint USDA-Department of Energy education grant program to drive carbon capture projects across rural America.  We must also protect forests and farmland, which serve as vital carbon sinks that hold carbon rather than releasing it and making the destabilization even worse.  The farm bill amends the popular Healthy Forests Reserve Program to prioritize carbon sequestration practices programs and discourage the development of forestland. It authorizes new programs to restore national forest landscapes, protect carbon-rich, old-growth trees, and prevent uncharacteristic wildfires and their emissions. It establishes a landmark soil health demonstration trial to keep carbon in the ground and promote healthy and productive farmland.  I am proud of what we did. It was done with the partnership of farmers and ranchers, and I have to say that our farmers understand the importance of protecting our land--their land--air, and water, I think, as much as, if not more than anyone else. No one's business is more impacted by severe and erratic weather than our farmers. They are caught right in the middle of it, and I appreciate their working with us to be part of the solution.  I am also working with my colleagues on policies to ensure that the United States, not China, is the global leader on advanced transportation technologies like electric and hydrogen vehicles.  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration are upending fuel economy and carbon regulations in a way that hurts the auto industry, consumers, and our environment. We need to invest more in renewable energy and the research that is making it more affordable all the time.  Electric utilities in Michigan have committed to dramatically increase renewable electricity, reduce carbon emissions by 80 percent, and stop burning coal.  Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration have rolled back the historic Clean Power Plan.  I am proud of the fact that Michigan utilities are moving forward anyway because they know it is the right thing and they know what is at stake. But this administration--Andrew Wheeler--has rolled back the historic Clean Power Plan, the Nation's first regulation of greenhouse gases from the power sector.  We need to be laser-focused on climate change and the existential threat it represents. Meanwhile, Andrew Wheeler and the Trump administration are doing their best to pretend that climate change is no big deal. That is even as the Pentagon recently concluded that two-thirds of critical military installations are threatened--two-thirds of critical military installations are threatened--by climate change. Climate change is a big deal, and it is time to do something about it that is real--not play political games, but to actually do something thoughtful and real about it.  In the wise words of Hank Williams, Jr., ``We need a little less talk and a lot more action.'' Andrew Wheeler has repeatedly shown no interest in acting. In fact, he wants to take us backward--and is taking us backward--on climate change. He has no interest in reducing, let alone eliminating, carbon pollution. We need to act, and it is clear that Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the EPA at this critical time for our country.  I urge a ``no'' vote on Andrew Wheeler for EPA Administrator."

Women stood up. They rallied. They marched. They made clear they do not want to go back to the days before the Roe v. Wade decision affirmed their right to make their own healthcare decisions.  Incredibly brave survivors, such as Dr. Ford and so many others, said they wanted to be heard and believed, not silenced.  Families across the country said they wanted a Justice who would interpret the law fairly and objectively, without partisanship--someone whose priority is the Constitution and people across the country, not President Trump and his extreme agenda.  Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, it is clear that President Trump and Republicans in Congress aren't listening to women or survivors or families, because the next nominee for the DC Circuit Court fails on each and every count I just listed.  As we speak, Neomi Rao is enacting the Trump agenda in her role as the head of the Agency that reviews and approves the Trump administration's changes to regulations impacting so many people in communities who stood up to oppose Justice Kavanaugh's nomination.  Under Ms. Rao's leadership, the Trump administration finalized a rule that prevents healthcare providers from even informing patients who come to title X-funded health centers about where to go to get safe--safe--legal abortions and places new, burdensome, medically unnecessary requirements on title X-funded health centers, designed specifically to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving these funds, meaning millions of patients may lose a source of quality, affordable, basic healthcare they trust.  Ms. Rao has helped put forward rules that would make it harder for members of the LGBTQ community and women to get the care they need by allowing providers to turn them away simply because of who they are or because they want birth control.  I also want to take a few minutes to address Ms. Rao's deeply concerning comments about rape and sexual assault. While in college, she wrote that ``a good way to avoid a potential date rape is to stay reasonably sober.''  Let's be clear. It is never a survivor's fault, ever, that someone raped or sexually assaulted them.  Ms. Rao was given an opportunity to explicitly reject those comments and failed to do so. She then sent a letter attempting to walk them back, but her actions speak louder than a letter sent during a nomination process, and her actions on this issue have been harmful.  In her role within the Trump administration, Ms. Rao has helped Secretary DeVos to roll back protections that help survivors get justice when they are sexually assaulted on campuses. In other words, at the same time that Ms. Rao claims her views have changed on sexual assault and consent, her actions are aligned with those who believe what she wrote in college. To the survivors I hear from and those who bravely spoke out against Justice Kavanaugh and so many others, Ms. Rao's actions are what matters.  Ms. Rao is also listening to corporate lobbyists instead of scientists when it comes to climate and our public health and is advancing rules that would allow more discrimination in our Nation's housing programs. Unfortunately, it seems that on many issues, where President Trump wants to do damage and hurt families, Ms. Rao is right behind him with a rubberstamp, just like Justice Kavanaugh and so many others President Trump has nominated to the bench.  We need judges who will do what workers and families expect of a judge--to interpret our laws according to the Constitution and what is best for our country, not according to politics and what is best for President Trump. That is why I am strongly opposing her nomination, and I hope all of our colleagues will join us in doing so.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to President Trump's nominee for Chief Counsel of the Internal Revenue Service, Michael Desmond.  This nominee comes before us just a week into this year's filing season, when our need for an IRS that treats all taxpayers fairly is clearer than ever.  Already, thousands of taxpayers across America are grappling with the fallout of the Trump tax bill and its capping of the State and local tax, or SALT, deduction. Already, the IRS has reported an average 17 percent drop in the size of tax refunds this year. Already, the broken promises made by President Trump and his Republican allies are being laid bare.  They promised middle-class families thousands of dollars of tax relief and a $4,000 raise in their salaries. Instead, they got $1.5 trillion in more debt and an economy that is even more rigged for big corporations and wealthy CEOs.  As bad as the Trump tax scam is for the whole country, it is worse for New Jersey families. That is because Republicans paid for a big chunk of their corporate giveaways by gutting the State and local tax deduction that New Jersey and other States' middle-class families depend on to write off their property taxes. In 2016, 1.8 million people--about 40 percent of New Jersey taxpayers--deducted their property and State income taxes. More than 80 percent of them earned less than $200,000, and the average deduction totaled $18,000--far above the arbitrary cap imposed by the Trump tax bill.  With tax season under way, many homeowners are just now realizing how badly their President ripped them off. To add insult to injury, the IRS issued haphazard guidance for the Trump tax bill that unfairly targets States like New Jersey, trying to simply lessen the burden heaped on them by the GOP.  In the final days of 2017, just days after President Trump signed the tax bill, New Jerseyans rushed to prepay their 2018 local property taxes and preserve their deductions before the new cap on the SALT deductions took effect. But then came Trump's IRS, which issued guidance to try to limit their ability to deduct property tax payments made in 2017 on their Federal returns--a stunning backdoor attempt to retroactively apply the cap on property tax deductions without cleared legislative tax to warrant doing so. Months later, the IRS again changed the rules on us by attacking New Jersey's new charitable deduction tax credit program. The IRS never had a problem when 32 other States offered tax credits for charitable donations. Only when New Jersey and other similarly situated States created a similar program did the IRS decide to change the rules.  Mr. Desmond would be the Chief Counsel of the IRS, the position directly overseeing the IRS's interpretation of these rule changes. Throughout his nomination, I was given no indication that Mr. Desmond would give fair treatment on these important issues affecting New Jersey and other States.  The full deductibility of State and local taxes has been a bedrock principle of our Tax Code since the income tax's creation in 1913, and that concept stretches all the way back to Alexander Hamilton's writings about the autonomy of States under the U.S. Constitution.  This commonsense policy allows States to invest in things like public safety, education, and infrastructure--the very things that make New Jersey a great place to live, work, and raise a family.  Make no mistake, the property tax deduction isn't just important for homeowners. It matters to all New Jersey families. It is why our public schools rank among the best in the Nation. It is why Save the Children named us the No. 1 State in America to raise a child. I want it to stay that way.  We must protect the investments that make New Jersey a place where families thrive. That is why last month I introduced bipartisan legislation to fully restore the State and local tax deduction. It is called the SALT Act, which stands for ``Stop the Attack on Local Taxpayers.'' It is no secret that in New Jersey and in many of the Nation's most economically productive States, families face high property tax bills and a higher cost of living. Our bill is designed to provide some relief. Simply put, the more you pay in property and State taxes, the more relief you get from our bill, and we help pay for it by repealing some of Trump's most unnecessary tax breaks for the superwealthy. It is the exact opposite of what the Trump tax bill says, which is, basically that the higher the cost of living is in your State, the more you pay in State and local taxes and the more you will owe to the Federal Government. That makes no sense.  Make no mistake, President Trump and his administration and the IRS have it out for States like New Jersey. Mr. Desmond would be the arbiter of how the IRS would interpret important tax issues affecting these States. That is why I oppose his nomination.  I yield back my time."

He has spent decades working in environmental policy at the EPA itself, here on Capitol Hill, and as a consultant to environmental and energy clients.

                "speech":"Mr. President, after careful consideration, I have decided to oppose the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler, the nominee for Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA.  While Mr. Wheeler is certainly qualified for this position, I have too many concerns with the actions he has taken during his tenure as Acting Administrator to be able to support his promotion. I believe that Mr. Wheeler, unlike Scott Pruitt, understands the mission of the EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards; however, the policies he has supported as Acting Administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health, particularly given the threat of climate change to our Nation.  I met at length with Mr. Wheeler, and we discussed many important environmental issues about which I care deeply, from EPA's enforcement of landmark environmental laws to greenhouse gas emissions and mercury pollution. Since last August, the EPA has proposed to roll back environmental protections, including determining it is no longer ``appropriate and necessary'' to regulate mercury emissions from power plants, halting efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks, and replacing the Clean Power Plan.  These efforts are of great importance to the State of Maine, which is located at the end of our Nation's ``air pollution tailpipe'' and is on the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in other States. Moreover, there is no doubt that the greenhouse gas emissions driving climate change pose a significant threat to our State's economy and our natural resources, from our working forests, fishing, and agricultural industries, to tourism, and recreation.  Reducing harmful air pollutants is critical for public health, particularly for Maine, which has among the highest rates of asthma in the country. In Maine, cars, trucks, and other vehicles produce more than 50 percent of our State's greenhouse gas emissions. Controls for mercury, one of the most persistent and dangerous pollutants, are especially important for children and pregnant women. The Agency's recent efforts to halt progress in these critical areas takes us in the wrong direction.  In keeping with my past practice, I will vote to allow the full Senate to consider Mr. Wheeler's nomination so that every Senator can have a clear up or down vote on this important nomination of a member of the President's Cabinet.  However, due to the actions Mr. Wheeler has taken during his tenure at the EPA, I will vote against his confirmation."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise to speak this afternoon about the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to become Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  The day after Mr. Wheeler was named EPA Acting Administrator, I wrote him a letter. I reminded Mr. Wheeler of the opportunity he had to try a new course for that Agency after Scott Pruitt's scandal-plagued administration. Yet in the 7 months as Acting Administrator, unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler has so far chosen not to reverse course at EPA in too many important instances. In some cases, he has even accelerated the environmental damage and regulatory zeal that his predecessor began.  I knew that Mr. Wheeler and I would not always agree on every issue, but like so many others, I did hope that he would moderate some of Scott Pruitt's most egregious and environmentally destructive policies, specifically on policies where industry and the environmental community are in broad agreement. Sadly, my hopes have not been realized.  To be clear, Mr. Wheeler is not the ethically bereft embarrassment that Scott Pruitt was. Mr. Wheeler has also engaged more frequently and substantively than Scott Pruitt did with both Congress and EPA career staff, but time and again, Mr. Wheeler has proven that his environmental policies are almost as destructive and extreme as his predecessor's, despite the explicit promises Mr. Wheeler has made to Members of Congress, both in private and in public meetings.  One of those promises was Mr. Wheeler's recent insistence that, when it comes to getting a deal on vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards with California and a coalition of 12 other States, including my State and the Presiding Officer's State, ``no one wants a 50-State deal more than I do.'' That was Mr. Wheeler's promise during his nomination hearing in front of the Environment and Public Works Committee in January.  Just weeks later, the headlines told a different story. For months, Mr. Wheeler said repeatedly that he shared my goal of striking a deal--not just my goal, but the goal of many of us here--with the State of California and a dozen of other States on fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards. Not long after he became Acting Administrator, however, Mr. Wheeler signed off on the Trump administration's proposal that freezes the standards for the better part of a decade, eliminates most of the air conditioning, electric vehicle, and other compliance credits that are supported by chemical companies, automobile and parts manufacturers, and utilities and preempts California's authority to set its own stronger standards.  What is more, the Trump administration reportedly plans to penalize rules that call for a 0.5-percent increase. That is a one-half of 1-percent increase in the stringency of those standards--one-tenth the pace called for in the rules that are already on the books.  Since that proposal was put forth, the entire automobile industry, many Members of Congress, and many other stakeholders have repeatedly asked the EPA to forge a compromise that avoids years of costly litigation and uncertainty for our automobile industry. So far, that is all for naught.  Just last week, unfortunately and inexplicably, EPA announced, with the White House and the Department of Transportation, that they decided to end their so-called negotiations with the State of California and, effectively, with 12 other States. These negotiations were superficial, at best, or duplicitous and designed to fail, at worst. Between you and me, I don't see how these discussions could have ended or failed because they never seriously began in the first place. It is outrageous.  That brings me back to Mr. Wheeler's promise. After his emphatic insistence that he wanted to find a 50-State solution for these standards, the decision to end them without ever making a serious effort to ever reach a compromise sends a clear message that, sadly, Mr. Wheeler--at least, in this instance--is unable to keep his word. I say that with no joy, but I say it nonetheless.  A second example of Mr. Wheeler's failure to lead in an appropriate way lies in his unreasonable opposition to submitting to the Senate for ratification something called a the ``Kigali Amendment'' to the Montreal Protocol.  I mentioned this to one of our colleagues. He said: Talk to me in English.  I reminded him that we used to use something called CFCs. It was a refrigerator coolant that was broadly used in this country until we found out it had very serious consequences for our ozone layer. Science, chemical companies, and chemists came up with a replacement to CFCs. We call them HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons, which are better for the ozone. They are still destructive to the greenhouse gas and destructive to our planet. Well, guess what. Scientists and chemists have, again, come up with a follow-on product to HFCs. It is not scientists and chemists in companies in other countries. They are right here in America. They have invested in a lot of money to come up with this discovery, this invention. They want to sell it. That requires the phaseout over time of HFCs.  We need the Kigali Amendment to be submitted to the Senate for ratification in order to open the door for our American companies to compete with a new technology that is good for jobs in America and good for our planet. Our country could gain 150,000 direct and indirect new jobs, and almost $40 billion in annual economic benefits by 2027 because the safer substitutes to HFCs are made in Texas and Louisiana. These are good-paying jobs. These are green manufacturing jobs that could help our efforts to address climate change while bolstering our country's economy.  Ratification of this treaty is supported by an extraordinary list of stakeholders, including more than a dozen of our Republican colleagues here in this Chamber. From the American Chemistry Council to the Chamber of Commerce, to FreedomWorks, to the Sierra Club, it seems that just about everyone supports ratification of this amendment, as best I can tell--everyone, that is, except EPA.  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, EPA also decided it is no longer ``appropriate and necessary'' to protect babies' brains from mercury and air toxic pollution emitted by electric utilities.  In the eleventh hour before the government shutdown, Mr. Wheeler signed a proposal that guts the legal foundation of the mercury and air toxics standards, also known as the MATS rule. Using outdated data and deciding that some benefits--like reduction in cancer, birth defects, and asthma attacks--are no longer important for the Agency to count, EPA is now setting a dangerous precedent and putting the mercury and air toxics standards rule in legal jeopardy. In fact, EPA has gone so far as to request public comment on whether the standards should be eliminated altogether.  Mr. Wheeler says that this action was necessary and that the proposal strikes a balance. That is just not true. In fact, the utility industry is in full compliance with these standards already, and they have done so at a third of the expected costs. That is why every stakeholder--from coal-fired utilities that comply with the rules to religious leaders, to environmental organizations, to the Chamber of Commerce--urged this administration not to take this step. In fact, utility groups and organized labor organizations wrote to EPA saying:       The industry already has invested significant capital--     estimated at more than $18 billion--in addition to these      operating costs, and states are relying on the operation of      these controls for their air quality plans. Therefore, we--  This being the group that wrote to EPA, including utility groups and organized labor groups--     urge EPA to . . . leave the underlying MATS rule in place and      effective.  Yet Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore the chorus of stakeholders who all hoped he would chart a more responsible path--on this front, too--even though utilities are not asking for this action that he is taking and the EPA is taking, and the courts are not requiring it.  Yet, from the stakeholders, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the utility industry over here to all of the NGOs and environmental groups and health groups over here, everybody says to leave this rule alone. It was adopted 7 years ago, and it works. It has worked at half the cost or at one-third of the cost. Leave it alone. I just don't get this. This is just another example of when Mr. Wheeler has taken a recklessly and unnecessary extreme course of action at the EPA.  Here is another one.  In May of 2018, after meeting with a victim's mother, Scott Pruitt, the former EPA Administrator, announced plans to finalize the Obama administration's ban to prohibit consumer and commercial paint stripping uses for something called methylene chloride--a hazardous chemical that has killed dozens of unsuspecting users in this country alone.  Despite explicit assurances provided to my office and others that the EPA would follow through with Mr. Pruitt's promise to protect both consumer and commercial users from methylene chloride, under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the EPA sent a final rule restricting only the consumer uses of methylene chloride to the White House's Office of Management and Budget. There have been 56 accidental exposure deaths related to methylene chloride since 1980--56--including properly trained workers who have worn protective gear on the job. Yet the EPA, under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, has decided to exempt workers from the methylene chloride ban.  A number of people have said to me they think it is unconscionable. I think they are right. With Mr. Wheeler at the helm, the EPA cannot even manage to ban a chemical that is so harmful to human health that stores--and this includes Walmart, Sherwin-Williams, Ace Hardware, Home Depot, and others--have already voluntarily taken it off their shelves.  That is not all. Even the EPA's recently announced PFAS Action Plan, which was released with much fanfare 2 weeks ago, did not do much more than renounce the same measures announced by Scott Pruitt almost a year ago. PFAS is sometimes referred to as forever chemicals. The reason, my colleagues, is that they last forever in our environment. It took a public outcry to make Mr. Wheeler reverse the Agency's inexplicable decision not to set an enforceable drinking water standard for PFAS. At his hearing last month, I asked him if he would agree to set a clean drinking water standard in 2 years--not in 2 weeks, not in 2 months but in 2 years--and he could not do that.  In short, over the past 7 months as the Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler has perpetuated and in at least one instance I have cited here today has worsened the preexisting inadequacies and failures Scott Pruitt left behind. When faced with opportunities to protect human health and the environment in ways that also have the support of the industries that would be regulated, time and again, Mr. Wheeler has failed to act in a way that I believe is responsible and has, instead, listened to some of the most extreme voices around him.  As I have said before and will say again, I am not making some futile attempt at changing the hearts and minds about this nominee at the eleventh hour. I am not that kind of Senator and never have been, and I was not that kind of Governor. I am not grandstanding, trying to get any press attention, or the perfect sound bite. I am, however, trying to convince some of my colleagues to seize this window of opportunity we have now to ensure that Acting Administrator Wheeler reverses course and governs responsibly at the EPA. That is what I am trying to do. That is what we are trying to do.  As the President's nominee to lead this Agency, under the provisions of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act, Mr. Wheeler can continue to lead the EPA as Acting Administrator until August 7 of this year. He is there, and he is going to be there. Rushing to judgment on this nomination will close the window of opportunity we have to ensure the Acting Administrator reverses course at the EPA and embraces the commonsense, bipartisan policies I just laid out--policies which make our environment cleaner and safer while they also create jobs and strengthen America's economy. I think we all want that. I think that is why people sent us here to negotiate those kind of win-win agreements.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no on this nomination so we can achieve those win-win situations that are there for the taking.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. President, the Senate is today considering the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is the job of the EPA to protect both the environment and human health. This critically important Agency needs Senate-confirmed leadership in place.  President Trump picked the right person to lead this Agency when he nominated Andrew Wheeler. Since April of last year, he has served as the Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and since July of last year, he has served as the Acting Administrator of the Agency. I believe Andrew Wheeler has done an outstanding job in leading the EPA over the past 7 months.  During the last administration, the EPA issued punishing regulations that would hurt the economy and raise costs on families. Under Acting Administrator Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has taken a different approach. The Agency is now putting forward proposals that both protect our environment and allow the country's economy to flourish.  Acting Administrator Wheeler has led efforts to issue commonsense regulatory proposals. These include the affordable clean energy rule and revising the definition of the waters of the United States. Both of these proposals show Mr. Wheeler is serious about clean air and clean water while they also show he understands there is an important role for States and local communities to play. It can't be a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach.  Acting Administrator Wheeler has played a critical role in implementing updates to the Toxic Substances Control Act and has taken steps to limit people's exposure to dangerous and toxic chemicals. These updates are the result of major bipartisan legislation that came out of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee in 2016.  Andrew Wheeler is working to limit lead exposure as well. Last December, he helped to unveil the Trump administration's multiagency effort to reduce the number of children exposed to lead in drinking water, in consumer products, and in paint. During his tenure, the EPA has also worked to provide greater regulatory certainty to States, to Tribes, to communities, and to the industries it regulates.  Mr. Wheeler is well qualified for the position of EPA Administrator. He has spent decades--actually, over 25 years--working in environmental policy. He has served as a career employee at the EPA as an environmental protection specialist. This experience makes him uniquely qualified to serve as the head of the Agency.  After that time, he spent over a decade here on Capitol Hill. When he left the EPA, he came here to work on the Environment and Public Works Committee. He served as the staff director of the Senate Environment and Public Works' Clean Air and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee for 6 years. Then he spent another 6 years working as the Republican staff director and chief counsel for the full committee under Chairman Jim Inhofe. After his time on the Hill, he also worked as a consultant for a variety of energy and environmental clients. He is very well qualified, and that is a big reason his nomination has received broad support.  There are 63 agricultural and forestry groups that wrote a letter in support of Mr. Wheeler's nomination to be the Administrator: ``It is hard to imagine a more qualified individual for the role of EPA administrator, and we respectfully request that the committee move to confirm his nomination so that he may be considered by the full Senate,'' they say, ``at the earliest date possible.''  Mr. Wheeler has received praise from the United Mine Workers of America.  Cecil Roberts, the union's international president, said the following about Mr. Wheeler: ``[H]e will be a reasonable voice within the agency, and will recognize the impact on both the workers and mining communities that are directly affected as EPA develops future emissions regulations.''  His experience and commitment to sound environmental policies has received recognition from the Democrats as well.  Senator Carper, who is with me on the floor and was the ranking member of our committee at one point, said of Mr. Wheeler when he was nominated for the Deputy Administrator's role: ``I think having worked in the agency, he actually cares about the environment; the air we breathe; the water we drink; the planet on which we live.'' I agree.  It is time to end the needless delays by the Senate Democrats. Andrew Wheeler's nomination to serve as the Deputy Administrator was delayed for months and had to be reported out of the EPW Committee twice before he was confirmed. Now the Senate Democrats are calling to delay the process again. These delays only slow down the Agency from meeting its objectives of helping communities and protecting the environment.  The EPA needs a Senate-confirmed Administrator in office. The EPA Administrator plays a central role in developing and implementing programs that are focused on meeting the EPA's mission of protecting human health and the environment. Andrew Wheeler is well qualified to lead this Agency and to serve in the President's Cabinet. He is the right person to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and I strongly encourage every Senator to support the nomination."

The TVA serves 9 million people in parts of seven Southeastern States. It provides affordable electricity for business customers and local power companies, for flood control, navigation, and land management for the Tennessee River system, plus economic development for the region. The TVA is credited with transforming the region into a growing population and a growing economic base.  With over 40 years of experience as a lawyer, Mr. Ryder will be a strong complement to the TVA's Board of Directors. The Environment and Public Works Committee attested to this fact when it reported his nomination favorably to the Senate by a voice vote twice--first, on May 22, 2018, during the 115th Congress, and the next on February 5 of this year after he had to be renominated during this Congress because of the delays in the nomination approval process last year. Mr. Ryder is another example of how the confirmation process has deliberately run aground. Mr. Ryder, in normal times, would have been confirmed and in office last summer. Instead, we have to go through a cloture vote on a well-qualified nominee who has twice been reported unanimously through the Environment and Public Works Committee.  Let's not delay this any longer. I urge my colleagues to vote with me in supporting the nomination of John L. Ryder to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  I thank the Presiding Officer.

                "speech":"Mr. President, later today, the House of Representatives will pass a proposal that will be supported by 95, 97 percent of Americans. This is a proposal to make sure anybody in this country who wants to buy a gun in a legitimate transaction has to go through a background check--a background check that in 90 percent of the cases takes less than 5 minutes of time. That background check will assure that only people who should be buying guns and owning guns will be buying and owning guns--people who don't have violent criminal histories and people who don't have histories of serious mental illness. It is a popular proposal. It is an impactful proposal. It will save thousands of lives all across this country.  I have come down to the floor to just remind my colleagues as to why this is so important, and I want to tell a quick story to try to put a little meat on the bone when it comes to this conversation we are having about the importance of making sure people go through background checks before they buy weapons.  Mr. President, 2008 to 2012 was a period of time in this country's history where violence was declining. Homicides were declining. Gun murders were declining. They were declining across the country. Specifically during that period of time, they were declining in the Midwest. Yet there was one State that stood out as a curious outlier during that period of time, and that was the State of Missouri.  In the State of Missouri, there was a dramatic jump during this period of time in gun homicides. In fact, it happened right away after 2007. In 2008 and 2009, about 50 to 60 to 70 additional people every year were being murdered with guns inside Missouri. A researcher from Johns Hopkins went to try to figure out why this was, and I think it is important to tell that story on the floor today.  Let me give a little historical context first. During the Civil War, Missouri was one of the most violent, most dangerous places in the country because there were these outlaws, these renegades of Confederates who were out in the bush--they call them the bushwhackers--who were doing regular battle with Union troops. It was one of the first instances of true, sustained guerilla warfare in this Nation. When the Civil War was over, they didn't go home. They had been brutally put down by the Union, but they stuck, and they formed their own smaller criminal enterprises.  We know about this because Jesse James and his brother Frank were amongst those who made their name as bushwhackers fighting the Union and then turned into criminals who robbed stage coaches and banks and trains.  To combat this post-Civil War continuation of violence, Missouri decided to change its firearms laws, and it started with a crackdown on the ability of individuals to conceal weapons. It extended to a change in the Constitution to make it perfectly clear that Missouri politicians had the ability to limit who could own guns and who couldn't.  Eventually, a provision got passed that said that in order to own a handgun, you had to get a permit from your local authority. As time went on, that permit came to include a background check, so that if you wanted to own a gun in Missouri, you had to go and get a background check. You had to prove you did not have a serious criminal history or a serious history of mental illness.  What happened in 2007 was that, very quietly, that provision got repealed. It was part of a much louder effort to repeal a whole host of gun laws in Missouri. Missouri kind of became the epicenter of the NRA's focus in the 2000s. It was this Southern--semi-Southern State that still had pretty tough gun laws, and the NRA went all in and had their annual convention in St. Louis and spent millions of dollars trying to elect folks who would sign laws they were pushing through the legislature. In 2007, they finally got their way. They got all these laws that had been passed since the Civil War repealed. One of them was the law that required you to get a background check before you could buy a gun.  The researcher from Johns Hopkins sort of looked at all these laws, controlled for all sorts of other factors, and came to the conclusion--you should read the paper; it is very well done--that it was this provision which removed the background check that led to this dramatic spike in violence. He has all sorts of interesting data to show why that is. All the other violent crime in Missouri stayed flat from 2008 to 2012, but gun crimes spiked. All of a sudden, guns bought in Missouri were being used in crimes all over the region. Other States started to report an increase--a curious, sudden increase--in crime guns that were bought in Missouri. Well, guess why. It was because all of a sudden, you didn't have to get a background check if you wanted to buy a gun in Missouri. All of a sudden, criminals and people with serious mental illnesses could get guns through gun shows and internet sales--transactions on the private market--without that background check.  I tell this story because I hear opponents of this bill in the House saying: This isn't meaningful. It won't work. These mass shootings weren't perpetuated with weapons that were bought without background checks.  Well, that is true. This one public policy intervention won't stop every single bad thing that happens in this country. But the data is the data, and it shows us that States that have background checks have dramatically lower rates of gun crime than States that don't have them.  A little bit earlier than the changes made in Missouri, my State of Connecticut made the opposite change. My State of Connecticut made a change to go from being a non-background check State to a background check State. We put in a local permit that came with a background check requirement. So even if you bought your gun outside of a bricks-and-mortar gun store, you had to get a permit, and that permit required you to get a background check.  Well, that same researcher went to Connecticut, ran all the numbers, and found out that in Connecticut, after that change was made, gun murders dropped by 40 percent. They increased in Missouri by about 25 percent and decreased in Connecticut by about 40 percent--and again controlling for all sorts of other factors that could explain those changes.  So on both sides of the ledger, there is what I would tell you is incontrovertible evidence that a State that has background checks is going to end up having many fewer gun crimes than a State that doesn't have them. The problem is, as we saw in and around Missouri, guns don't respect borders, so when Missouri dropped its gun background check requirement, those guns started moving into other States.  That is what happened in my State. The guns that are used to commit crimes in our cities--the guns that are trafficked out of the back of vans--aren't bought from Connecticut gun stores; they are bought by criminals in other States because they know they can go to gun shows and they can turn to internet sales in those other States and buy those weapons.  The same thing happens as weapons move across our border. I have heard an awful lot from this President about how dangerous Mexico and Central America are. Well, there is some truth to that, but the guns that are being used in those crimes are trafficked from the United States of America, and the way they get to the southern border is through States that don't have background check requirements.  Just go online and check out what people say who have been arrested for gun trafficking. They tell you exactly how they did it. They go to gun shows in Texas. They buy guns at unregulated gun shows in Texas, and they take them back across the border and sell them in Central America.  So we have all the evidence we need--empirical evidence, anecdotal evidence--to pass this piece of legislation, but maybe the most important reason that we should pass it, that we should take it up here in the Senate when it passes the House later today, is that it is just so darn popular. There really isn't anything else in America today that is as popular as universal background checks. The minimum score is about 90 percent. There is plenty of really good polling that says that 97 percent of Americans support universal background checks. Grandma isn't that popular. Apple pie isn't that popular. There is nothing we debate here that gets 97 percent on agreement other than the issue of background checks.  So I am here on the floor today to try to fill in some of the details on why this is so important and to implore my colleagues, once it passes the House of Representatives, to bring it here. Obviously, I would love to have a vote on the House bill, but I understand how this place works. We are going to send a letter to Chairman Graham asking him to at the very least convene a hearing on background checks in the Judiciary Committee.  We came to a conclusion here in the Senate as to a bipartisan background checks proposal that could get 50 votes--in 2013--and I would love to start that process again. But there is no reason not to do it because all the evidence tells us that when we make sure that only the right people buy guns, a lot less people die from gun crimes.  This is not controversial anywhere except for Washington, DC. Everybody out there in the American public wants us to pass universal background checks. Maybe some other interventions in this space are a little bit more controversial, split folks a little bit more, but not background checks. This thing is decided outside of the Senate Chamber and the House Chamber. Popular in the public, deeply impactful, will save thousands of lives--that is a triple we don't get very often here, and we should take advantage of the opportunity.  Let me leave you with this: I convened a panel a couple of nights ago to talk about the importance of background checks, and there were a number of parents of those who were lost to gun violence. One of the parents was from Sandy Hook. Another was a parent of a child who was killed in Chicago, and she really wanted to make sure we knew what the real impact of gun violence in America was. She wanted to make sure we knew that the victims aren't just those who show up on the police blotter; the victims are the parents and the brothers and the sisters and the friends and the coworkers.  The average number of people who experience some diagnosable trauma when somebody in their life is shot and killed is 20. So when you hear the number that 100 people in the United States die every day from guns--which is a number 10 to 20 times higher than in any other high-income nation on a per capita basis--you have to understand that number isn't really 100; that number is 20 times higher than that because the people who have to live with that loss have to ask these questions: Why did they shoot themselves? What do I do about that individual who shot my son? How do I get over that combination of pain and anger? That is hard to understand unless you have spent time with the mothers and the fathers who will be dealing with this catastrophic, life-changing trauma for the rest of the time they are on this Earth.  So that is why this is so serious to me. It is because we have an answer for their pain--not an answer that will stop every gun crime in this country but an answer that will result in thousands fewer people dying. We know that because the evidence tells us that. And I can't explain to these families--to that mother in Chicago--why something that has been proven to work and is supported by 90 percent of Americans can't get a vote or a debate in the Senate.  I will leave it at that for today. I hope that when this passes in the House with a big bipartisan majority, we will take advantage of the opportunity to get a big bipartisan majority here in the Senate. If the Republican majority commits to starting that process, I guarantee that will be the result.  I want to thank all of the people who made this possible in the House today.  For the record, I have introduced a version of H.R. 8 here in the U.S. Senate.  To Chairman Nadler,   Mike Thompson, Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, and to their Republican cosponsors who helped bring it to the floor--I thank them on behalf of all of the folks they will never know, those lives they will save by their action today if we do the right thing and take it up here in the Senate.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, it was 1986, a third of a century ago. Six U.S. Senators wrote a letter to the Office of Technology Assessment, the office then charged with providing technical and scientific advice to Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: These six U.S. Senators were troubled by testimony they had heard about climate change in three separate hearings of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. They wrote: Well, that was quite a prediction. Who were these six Senators? Quentin Burdick, Democrat from North Dakota; Max Baucus, Democrat from Montana; George Mitchell, Democrat from Maine; Robert Stafford, Republican from Vermont, the chairman then of the committee; Dave Durenberger, Republican of Minnesota; and Rhode Island's Republican Senator, John Chafee.  You cannot help but be struck that the prediction back then by these six Senators is now our reality. Everything they predicted is happening. The scientists they listened to had it right. Global temperatures have already risen by around 1 degree Celsius, and we are headed to over 2 degrees Celsius of global warming by the end of the century.  Their grim predictions, which we now live with as fact, motivated these six Senators to ask the Office of Technology Assessment for policy options that ``could lead to the stabilization and minimization of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.''  Why did they want these policy options? They wanted to learn about policy options because, as they continued in their letter: ``Without delay.'' Since then, Republicans have demolished the Office of Technology Assessment; that office no longer exists. Republicans have relentlessly blockaded legislation to address carbon emissions and have trafficked in phony climate denial, all while accepting hundreds of millions of dollars of political contributions from the fossil fuel industry.  Today, five of those six States are represented again, having a reunion on the Senate floor. I see Senator Tester from Montana here. I will yield to him now. We will also be joined by Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and Angus King of Maine.  I yield to Jon Tester of Montana, taking the position of his predecessor, Max Baucus--whom, by one of the weird coincidences of the Senate, I just passed coming out of the trolley.  Senator Tester, the floor is yours."

                "speech":"I thank Senator Whitehouse.  I could not in my wildest dreams be able to replace Senator Baucus in what he did. But what he did back in 1986, along with a number of other Senators Senator Whitehouse just talked about, was visionary.  He signed a letter asking Federal researchers to study solutions for limiting the causes of climate change. This was in 1986, some 33 years ago. That same year, as I am today, my wife and I were farming in North Central Montana, a farm that then had been in the family for about 70 years.  During the time before 1986, and since 1986, we have seen a lot of changes on the farm. That is why it is interesting--because those changes have increased more than ever, I believe, in the last 20 years.  When this letter was sent off to study solutions in 1986, it was incredibly visionary because it was before climate change was even talked about much. Yet this group of Senators was able to see the negative impacts of this coming down the pike.  By the way, when we talk about negative impacts of climate change--you probably have this, Senator Whitehouse, but somebody ought to put together how many hundreds of billions of dollars we have spent on natural disasters in the last 10 or 12 years compared to how much we spent in years previous. I can tell you, it was a few years ago that every State in the Union except one or maybe two had a natural disaster. That is because our climate is changing. It is because our climate is getting more erratic. I have seen it on our farm. I have seen August turn from the driest month to one of the wettest months. Over the last 20 years, I have seen a reservoir--a reservoir is a manmade area to hold water for livestock. I have seen a reservoir that never went dry from the time my father built it in the early 1950s to going dry for consecutive years. I have seen dangerous floods. I have seen water where we have never had it before. I have seen drought like we have never had it before.  I would just say, in regard to that, we just had a vote on a guy by the name of Wheeler, whom the President nominated to lead the EPA, who actually is one of these guys who doesn't believe in climate change at all. I don't know where the President finds these people, and I don't know how this body can support somebody who is this big of a denier, who wants to slow enforcement on polluters.  There is one thing we need to keep in mind in this country when we try to put people like Wheeler up for head of EPA. If you take a look at the third-world nations in this world, those are the nations that have destroyed their resource base. If you want to pollute our water and if you want to pollute our air, that is destroying our resource base. I guarantee you, that is not a way to make America great. It is not even a way to keep America great.  This nominee is rolling back the clean water rule. He has allowed more uses for asbestos in commerce when, in our State of Montana, Libby can tell you all about asbestos. People are still dying from its effects.  That aside--the Wheeler nomination, which is a catastrophe in itself--I could tell you that the Senators who stood on this very floor 33 years ago understood--understood--that we have a challenge in front of us greater than any other challenge we have faced before, and that is climate. As we talk about what they did in 1986--we are in 2019 now--now is the time to come up with some workable solutions--workable for our climate and workable for our economy--to get our arms around this very serious problem.  I am going to tell you what is at risk here. I love Nevada, but I don't want Montana turning into an ecosystem like Nevada has. We raise some of the best wheat and the best cattle and the best post-crops in the world, but it takes a predictable environment to do that. In some places in our State, we are on the edge of desertification, turning into desert.  The issue that revolves around climate change impacts each and every one of us in this body. Whether we are in denial or not, that is a fact, and it is incumbent upon us, as Senators who represent great States all around this Nation, to come up with solutions that our kids and our grandkids will be proud of.  I yield the floor back to Senator Whitehouse."

                "speech":"I thank Senator Tester.  I will turn to the Rhode Islander who was in that early bipartisan effort to understand and address climate change. Senator John Chafee's history of service to his State and country was remarkable. He saw bloody combat in World War II on Guadalcanal and Okinawa with the 1st Marine Division. He went back as a Marine rifle company commander during the Korean war with Dog Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines. He served in Rhode Island's legislature and as our Governor. In 1969, he was appointed Secretary of the Navy. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976 and chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee from 1995 until his death in 1999. In the small Rhode Island world, he was also my father's college roommate and lifelong friend.  The environment was an abiding passion for this man, and his devotion showed in his work in the Senate. His legacy includes the Superfund Program, the Oil Pollution Act, and the 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, and his legacy is his early recognition that climate change, driven by carbon pollution, caused by fossil fuels, poses an existential threat to humanity and the planet we call home.  At the 1986 hearing that led to this bipartisan letter, Chafee declared: This is 1986, and the Republican chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee is saying that the scientific evidence is telling us we have a serious problem.  He went on to say: I yield now to the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and honorary Senator pro tempore, Patrick Leahy, here on behalf of the State of Vermont."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Rhode Island.  I could not help but think--as I saw the picture of John Chafee, with whom I had the honor of serving here in the Senate--of John Chafee's close friendship with Robert Stafford, who was my senior Senator when I came here, both having served in World War II, both with a naval background, both people who cared first and foremost about the country and the environment. I am going to speak a little bit further about Bob Stafford as we go.  When we laid John Chafee to rest in Rhode Island, I remember sitting there and listening to the eulogies. Both Republicans and Democrats were speaking about this man.  Also, referring to what the Senator from Rhode Island has said, more than 30 years ago we had cooperation and bipartisanship. It was a hallmark of the U.S. Senate. It was a bipartisan group of Senators who sounded the alarm about climate change. They made a very modest request to the Office of Technology Assessment. They said: Study the issue of climate change and make recommendations to avert global disaster.  Those Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, were concerned that human activity might directly cause permanent, destructive, and widespread changes to our planet's climate system--changes that would put our entire economy, ecosystem, and, our very own existence at risk.  As I said, one of these Senators was my senior Senator, my mentor, when I came here and one of the finest Senators who ever served--Republican Robert Stafford, from Vermont.  Today, led by Senator Whitehouse, I think that what many of us are trying to do is what Senator Chafee and Senator Stafford did. We want to recall that moment in 1986 and renew the warning those Senators issued 33 years ago.  Let me speak about Senator Stafford. When I came here at the ripe old age of 34, I was the only Democrat ever elected in my State. Robert Stafford was ``Mr. Republican.'' He took me under his wing. He had been a Congressman. He had been a Governor. He had been an attorney general. He served in World War II and in Korea. He was a mentor, but he was also an example. His legacy is one of sensible, pragmatic Vermont values that he brought to Washington for decades. They weren't Republican or Democratic.  Senator Stafford was--like most Vermonters--a champion for the natural environment. With his work on landmark environmental legislation, like the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and the Superfund program, Senator Stafford represented the best of Vermont's commitment to sustainability.  His appeals to reason and for common ground, and his belief in sound science resonate even more today than when he left this body three decades ago. If he were here today, I believe he would be calling on both sides of the aisle to act now to ensure that we can pass on a secure and livable planet for generations to come and to act before it is too late.  Today, so many people still refuse to accept what is now an overwhelming scientific consensus--that climate change is real and that humans are the dominant cause of it. What is worse, for the last 2 years many in Congress have willfully accelerated the devastation caused by global warming by enabling the Trump administration's erosion of our Nation's bedrock environmental protections--protections that I have fought for throughout my nearly 45 years in the Senate.  As climate scientists warn of the urgent need to reduce emissions and reverse the global rise in temperatures, many Senators have refused to preserve even the status quo. Instead, in the last 2 years, we have seen the rollback of commonsense regulations, often at the behest of private interests that have spent decades misinforming the public and suppressing their own science on the long-term hazards of the fossil fuel industry.  Alarmingly, this week the Senate is poised to confirm someone to lead the Environmental Protection Agency--the Agency that is charged with safeguarding the air and water on which we depend--who, despite the scientific consensus, denies that climate change is the great threat we face today.  To growing numbers of Americans it is saddening--actually, it is maddening--and most of all, deeply alarming that the Trump administration and many others in leadership positions have made Trumpism's anti-science, know-nothing agenda their default position. This poses existential threats not only to our children and grandchildren but to our generation.  More than three decades ago, long before protecting our planet became a partisan issue, the Environment and Public Works Committee held 3 days of hearings on climate change. Those 1986 hearings compelled a bipartisan group of Senators to acknowledge and warn the public about a ``fundamentally altered planet'' as a result of the ``substantial greenhouse warming'' that was projected.  They asked what could be done to prevent consequences ``ranging from disruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity to shifts in population,'' and ``extreme weather events, such as droughts, monsoons, and lowland floods.'' These words of warning were neither radical nor partisan. They were sensible.  So what has changed since then? The ice caps are melting--only faster. Certainly, the glaciers I saw when I visited Antarctica 25 or so years ago had been there for eons, and they are now fast disappearing. Our coastline is still disappearing but faster. Farmers and ranchers are still concerned about prolonged droughts and extreme weather, only, today, the fires and storms are more frequent and more devastating.  Just last month, the intelligence community's ``Worldwide Threat Assessment'' offered a sobering conclusion. This is the intelligence community's assessment: ``Global environmental and ecological degradation, as well as climate change, are likely to fuel competition for resources, economic distress, and social discontent through 2019 and beyond.''  We know that bipartisan action on big environmental threats is possible. In fact, soon after the climate change hearings in 1986, Marcelle and I climbed Vermont's Camel's Hump with President Reagan's EPA Administrator. We wanted to show him the terrible damage caused by acid rain. We could see that mountain from our home. We could see the changes up close. They were very obvious. With President Reagan's EPA Administrator's support, we moved ahead with the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and they were signed into law by President George H. W. Bush. It was not a partisan issue. The result was a great reduction in the scourge of acid rain. We see these results every day.  Today we are in danger of taking such results for granted. It is up to us to protect this planet. If we don't, who will? There is no more urgent responsibility.  There are bold ideas for how to address this challenge. The Green New Deal offers a valuable roadmap for debate and a pathway for action. The time for dallying around the edges of the issue is over. We all share responsibility for where we are today. So, likewise, we have an obligation to attack this issue, but not with cynical show votes, not with feel-good votes intended to demonstrate a political divide rather than what should be universal acknowledgment of what we know to be true--that climate change is real, and human activity is the primary cause of these threats to our way of life, our communities, and our planet.  We have to channel the American innovative spirit that has improved our lives for centuries. We have to find creative solutions for reducing carbon emissions, and then we have to invest in those solutions. We have to reorient our workforce toward the great opportunities that are opening for green-economy jobs. We should invest in leading the whole world in developing clean energy solutions. We have to address this real emergency head-on. Not only can we curb climate change, but, in doing so, we can transform the American economy.  Over 30 years ago, a handful of forward-looking Republicans and Democrats stood together in this Senate. I was proud to be here when they issued their challenge, but the time for delay is over. In fact, our time is running out.  Let this renewed vigor in addressing climate change, brought about by the bold proposed Green New Deal, be the catalyst for real change. Let's stand together.  Senator Whitehouse has enlightened us on so many of these issues, but we have also learned, as he did, from our mentors--like Senator Chafee, Senator Stafford, and the others who got together in 1986. It is not partisan and it is not political. It is survival.  I yield the floor."

I appreciate his words so much.  The sad thing that we face is that despite words like those uttered by Senator John Chafee--``allowing these gases to continue to build in the atmosphere . . . may be committing all of us to severe economic and environmental disruption''--or the words in the letter that John Chafee signed right here and that Senator Leahy's mentor, Bob Stafford, signed right here back on December 23, 1986, no Republican Senator can utter those words today. Today's Republican Party will not even acknowledge that climate change is a serious problem--let alone put forward a serious proposal to tackle it. Republican Leader Mitch McConnell's latest trick is to call, for the first time, a climate-related measure on the Senate floor for his side to vote against it. The leader has not brought a single piece of climate legislation to the floor for a vote, ever, until this vote, which he is bringing up for his side to vote against.  It actually gets worse. Since the infamous Citizens United Supreme Court decision almost 10 years ago, no Republican in the Senate has offered or sponsored comprehensive climate legislation to limit carbon pollution--none.  So we look back with some real sorrow to 1986, when this bipartisan letter was written. Of course, Minnesota was represented in that letter by Dave Durenberger, and Minnesota is represented here on the floor today by Senator Klobuchar.  I yield to her."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for his leadership day in and day out on this issue.  I rise to join him and my other colleagues to talk about this letter and to look back at that moment in time but really to do it to look forward because we know it is long past time for bipartisan action on climate change.  As the Senator from Rhode Island has explained with a copy of that letter, back in 1986, a bipartisan group of Senators came together to voice their concerns about the future of our world.  This forward-thinking group of our predecessors, who were from the same States as my colleagues who are here today, held 3 days of hearings on climate change. That sounds like a pretty good idea for something we should be doing right now. It was chaired by, of course, the Republican Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. John Chafee.  Minnesota Senator David Durenberger was among that group of Senators. He was born in St. Cloud. He earned his law degree from the University of Minnesota, was the top-rated cadet in his ROTC class, and served as a lieutenant in the Army Counter Intelligence Corps and as a captain in the U.S. Army Reserve.  Senator Durenberger took over the seat left by Senator Humphrey, and during his 17 years of service in the Senate, Senator Durenberger proved time and again that he is a true believer in bipartisanship. He worked across the aisle to tackle big issues, and that included talking about climate change way back in 1986.  I called Senator Durenberger this week to talk to him, and our staff did, to get some sense of where he was on climate change years later. He reported to us that, in his words, he wanted to remind Americans there was a time in our very recent history when the U.S. Senate made it its responsibility to define and address some of the critical national and international policy issues that threaten the security of our communities, our Nation, and the world.  This is Senator Durenberger speaking in the year 2019. He said he could say ``without reservation that it was bipartisan Senate leadership that encouraged the four Presidents with whom [he] served--Carter, Reagan, [George H.W.] Bush, and Clinton--to prioritize environmental problem definition and solution.''  He also recalled working with his colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to ``challenge''--and these are his words--``challenge the scientific community and the business community to work harder at reducing the impact [of greenhouse gases] and suggesting what policies best incentivize alternative fuels.''  It was in this bipartisan spirit that this group of Senators sent a letter to Dr. John Gibbons, who was then the executive director of the Office of Technology Assessment. In that letter, they talked about the need to meet ``the massive and, to some degree irrevocable, alterations in the stratosphere commonly referred to as the greenhouse effect.''  The letter goes on to discuss concerns about ``altered precipitation and storm patterns,'' something certainly the Senator from Rhode Island knows we are seeing right now. These Senators were ahead of their time--altered precipitation and storm patterns.  ``[M]ore frequent and extreme weather events,'' they talked about that. Look at what we are seeing with the hurricanes, with the rising sea levels, and with the wildfires in Colorado and in California.  ``[D]isruption of forest, crop, and ocean productivity.'' That letter may have been sent in 1986, but certainly those Democratic and Republican Senators were ahead of their time. Americans are now increasingly feeling the effects of changing climate patterns and extreme weather events. Farmers are already living through these disruptions to crop productivity.  So what else did the letter say? Well, it said this: ``We are deeply troubled by the prospect of such a rapid and unprecedented change in the composition of the atmosphere and its implications for the human and natural worlds.'' It also stated that ``it may be necessary to act soon to at least slow these trends or, perhaps, halt them altogether.''  Think of those words way back in 1986 asking us to act soon. They were right back then, and they are still right today. The true tragedy is that the final paragraph of the letter notes that any analysis should be undertaken without delay ``due to the likelihood that legislation will be seriously considered by the Committee early in the next Congress.''  Well, the truth is, we are still waiting for that legislation to be seriously considered. The bipartisan call in that 1986 letter came in the 99th Congress, and we are now beginning the 116th. Just as troubling, we have lost some of the bipartisan spirit that guided David Durenberger and those 1986 lawmakers. Our inaction has outlasted even the Office of Technology Assessment itself.  I ask my colleagues, in the spirit of bipartisanship--from back in 1986, my colleague Senator Durenberger, who I hope is listening today--let us continue that spirit, and let's get some serious climate legislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate.  I yield the floor."

The Senator spoke of bipartisanship. Do you know who voted with Senator Chafee for the Clean Air Act amendments of 1990? The Republican Senate majority leader did, as did a majority of the Republican caucus in the Senate.  In fact, those powerful 1990 Clean Air Act amendments passed 89 to 10. Where do I go to get a majority leader like that back? Where do I go to get a Senate Republican Party like that back? As late as 2009, Donald Trump published an advertisement in the New York Times that said that the climate science was ``scientifically irrefutable''--scientifically irrefutable--and that if we didn't do anything about it, there would be ``catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet.'' That is Donald Trump in 2009.  Where do I go to get that Donald Trump back? What happened? In 2007, when I first joined this body, there were Republicans working on climate legislation all over the place. Senator Klobuchar and I came together that year. We had, by my count, five pieces of bipartisan climate legislation that were working through this body in various stages in 2007, 2008, and 2009, when Donald Trump put this advertisement in the New York Times saying that the science was scientifically irrefutable and the consequences would be catastrophic and irreversible.  Then came January of 2010. Then came the Citizens United decision. Then came unlimited and often anonymous fossil fuel money sloshing around in America's politics and all the threats and promises that unlimited money allows special interest to engage in. Now, those days, the Donald Trump of 2009, Republican cooperation of 2007, 2008, and 2009, and of course this letter from as long ago as 1986 seems impossible, but I hope we can get together. We have to do better than Republican political mischief on climate change.  Calling up bills that you intend to vote against--give me a break.

One of those Senators was George Mitchell of Maine, one of the great legislators of the 20th century. I am honored to be in the seat that once was occupied by George Mitchell and also by his predecessor, Edmund Muskie. I think the story of the major environmental legislation of the 20th century, sponsored principally at the beginning by Edmund Muskie, the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, is worth mentioning, if only briefly.  The most important point is that the Clean Air Act, one of the most important and comprehensive environmental pieces of legislation in our Nation's history, passed this body unanimously. It passed this body unanimously.  It disturbs me that we couldn't agree on the time of day around here unanimously these days. I don't know when this issue became a partisan issue, but I deeply regret it because it is causing harm to our country.  What I would like to do is step into George Mitchell's shoes for a moment and read a statement that he himself wrote and made back in 1986, and you are not going to believe how prescient this statement is. It could have been written yesterday. Here are George Mitchell's words:       The problem of global warming is one of immense      significance. It is the most serious and more pressing than      anticipated. Previously, most of the models forecasting the      rate of global warming focused on the air pollutants produced      by the combustion of fossil fuels. More recent data suggest      that trace gases may also increase the rate of warming by a      factor of two. This means that warming may be increasing      twice as fast as previously thought.       The data produced to date suggests there may be an average      increase in temperature of 1 deg.C since the beginning of the      industrial revolution.  This was in 1986. We are now at about 1.5 degrees centigrade.       Considering how much warmer this June has been than      average, a 1 degree difference may appear to be      insignificant, but an average of 1 degree increase could be      devastating, so the experts tell us. A 1 degree increase in      the average global temperature would melt glaciers--  That is happening--     and such melting would increase the sea level.  That is happening.       There are uncertainties in predicting how much the sea      level would increase in a particular area. In some cases, it      could be an average increase of a few feet; in others, much      more. For a coastal State like Maine and to other States      along the coastline, such an increase would be devastating.  To deviate from George's words for a moment, this is what we see happening. We are now seeing what are called rainy day floods, flooding in areas of our country along the coast that were rare. Six-month events are now every high tide.  George Mitchell says:       An average of 1 degree increase in temperature could have      major impacts on agriculture. This country's Midwestern bread      basket could again become a dust bowl. More heat would mean      less water for crops and variations in growing seasons. It is      important to keep in mind that this average increase is      global in nature. It is not a national or regional problem.      If American farmers suffer for lack of water, so will farmers      all over the planet. If shorelines along our coasts are      flooded, so will shorelines everywhere in the world.       The enormity of this phenomenon is staggering, and we have      a responsibility to limit emissions of pollutants that trap      the heat in our atmosphere. As difficult, as immense, and as      seemingly remote as the problem is to our daily lives, we      cannot delay.  This was George Mitchell in 1986--we cannot delay.       There will be those who argue that more research is      necessary to completely understand the phenomenon and to      answer every scientific question.  We are still hearing that argument today--we need more science; we need more studies; we are not sure.  George goes on:       As in the case of acid rain, such complete understanding      will come only after we flounder in the weight of our      shortsighted policies. This is one more indication that the      benefits of industrialization carry with them the burden of      controlling pollutants. These pollutants threaten our lakes,      fish, health, and forests today in the form of acid      deposition.       We will hear today that these pollutants also threaten the      future of our planet, which cannot tolerate such a sudden and      dramatic increase in temperature and survive in a form      familiar to us.  In 1986 George Mitchell said:       Solutions are possible and available. The statement      released at the conclusion of the Villach Conference in      Austria last October--  This was in 1985--     addresses the common nature of some of our environmental      problems. That statement said in part that ``climate change      and sea level rises due to greenhouse gases are closely      linked with other major environmental issues, such as acid      deposition and threats to the Earth's ozone shield, mostly      due to changes in the composition of the atmosphere by human      activity.''       Reduction in coal and oil use and energy conservation      undertaken to reduce acid deposition will also lower      concentration of greenhouse gases. Reductions in emissions of      chlorofluorocarbons--  Which we achieved--     will help protect the ozone layer and will also slow the rate      of climate change. The rate and degree of future warming      could be profoundly affected by governmental policies on      energy conservation, use of fossil fuels, and the emission of      greenhouse gases.  Those words were written 32 years ago.       The rate and degree of future warming could be profoundly      affected by governmental policies on energy conservation, use      of fossil fuels, and the emission of greenhouse gases.  The testimony that they were intending to hear at the hearing that George is describing demonstrated ``that such governmental policies are needed . . . nationally and on a global basis.''  I pause on ``a global basis''--the tragedy of leaving the Paris climate accord, because the only solution to this problem has to be local, national, and global.  The testimony from Federal Agencies will be that the current government policy is to conduct more research, a familiar refrain on issues of this type. George Mitchell said:       What is missing in the Federal effort is action. The      problem of global warming brings another round of scientists      before us decrying the folly of waiting until it is too late      to  prevent irreversible damage. In the case of acid rain,      research has been offered as a substitute for much-needed      action. This policy has produced more bodies of water that      cannot sustain life, more trees that are dying, and more      people who find it hard to breathe.       The policy has produced more studies, not any meaningful      change in policy. I hope these two days of hearings will help      persuade the administration--  And the people of the country--       that inaction has its own costs, almost invariably higher      than the cost of action.  George Mitchell was right. The cost of inaction is invariably higher than the cost of action.  George concluded by saying:       I represent a State that already has been affected by acid      deposition. I want to do all I can to keep Maine, the rest of      our country, and our planet from facing potentially more      dramatic environmental damage from global warming. The best      way to avoid these undesirable outcomes is to begin taking      action now to prevent further damage rather than spending      twice as much time and later money repairing damage.  George Mitchell was right in 1986. Tragically, he is even more right today because we did not heed his call. We did not take action. We have avoided action.  I don't want to be the generation that our children and grandchildren look back on and say: Where were you and what did you do when the climate was deteriorating, when the glaciers were melting, when the ice sheets were melting, when the sea level was rising, when the storms were increasing in intensity, when the wildfires were burning our States? What did you do, Senator?  I, for one, want the answer to be ``I took action.'' The answer should be ``we took action.''  Today, this is a challenge even greater--significantly greater--than it was in 1986, but the very fact that people like Quentin Burdick, George Mitchell, John Chafee, Bob Stafford, and David Durenberger saw the future and predicted it so succinctly and profoundly should spur us to the type of action that is necessary to meet, confront, and overcome this most serious of challenges before us.  Thank you.  I yield to my colleague from Rhode Island."

For this 24-month period, the 18 committees covered by this resolution are authorized to spend up to $214,055,860. This is a small increase over the funding authorized by the current committee funding resolution, S. Res. 62. For the information of my colleagues, committee funding authorized by S.

It is in our committees that policy is created and programs and agencies are overseen. Our committees are where the Senate first exercises its advice and consent function over the executive branch's nominees. Well-functioning committees are crucial to the Senate's role as a separate but equal branch of the government.  The resolution before the Senate is the result of a bipartisan process Senator Klobuchar, the Rules Committee's ranking member, and I undertook this year to solicit more input from committee chairmen and ranking members. The resolution reflects the needs identified by our colleagues and will help ensure our committees are able to carry out their responsibilities and duties.  I would like to thank Fitz Elder and Rachelle Schroeder from my committee staff; Lizzy Peluso and Lindsey Kerr from Senator Klobuchar's committee staff; and Cindy Qualley, the Rules Committee's chief clerk. Additionally, I would like to thank Ileana Garcia and Ted Ruckner from the Disbursing Office and John Henderson from the Office of Legislative Counsel. I greatly appreciate their hard work in developing this resolution."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I just listened to the other debate on the floor, and it reminded me of the fact that our friends on the other side of the aisle introduced a resolution calling on the Federal Government to adopt what they call the Green New Deal.  From my point of view, the legislation is pretty far outside the mainstream in what it is proposing and how it is proposing the problems we should be debating. I don't have any problem with that. Those problems should be solved, and even though it seems pretty far outside the mainstream of thought, at least 12 of our colleagues in the Senate have cosponsored it. The majority leader thought it would be fair if we had that idea out there--it is getting a lot of public attention--to have a chance to debate this legislation and vote on it in the Senate.  The Democrats have called it a sham. They said: Why should we have debate on this piece of legislation? Why would we want to vote on this piece of legislation?  Now, it is not cosponsored by a majority of the Members of the Senate, but it is cosponsored by over 25 percent of the Democrats in the Senate, and one would think that if 25 percent of their conference is sponsoring a bill, they would be glad to come to the floor and talk about that bill and talk about what it does.  So let's talk for just a couple of minutes about what that bill actually says. One of the things that it does is that it calls for the United States to use 100 percent renewable energy by 2030. That is just a little more than 10 years from now. It says, basically, that we want to have a zero-carbon-dioxide emissions by then.  I know there was some discussion in the rolling out of this bill that that would mean that ground transportation and air transportation would either be eliminated or minimized--at least the way we travel right now would be. At some point in the future that may happen, but it is highly unlikely it is going to happen in the next 10 years, which is what the bill calls for. Maybe that is why they don't want to debate it. Even President Obama's former science adviser says that this is not feasible. Harvard University professor John Holdren was quoted in the New York Times saying: ``As a technologist studying this problem for 50 years, I don't think we can do it.''  So that is a pretty good source who indicates that what we are talking about here can't happen. So that big headline goal appears to be impossible, but we probably could debate it anyway. Let's hear from the other side, particularly the 12 cosponsors, to say why it is possible, why we should be able to do that, and why that is in the legislation that they filed.  The rest of the legislation goes really beyond things that don't relate to the environment. There is a laundry list of policies that appear to be popular right now in the so-called progressive discussion. One is a single-payer health system and the other is a Federal job guarantee. The talking points suggested that that would be a Federal job guarantee for people who can't work or aren't willing to work. Of course, that was so controversial that immediately people began to say: Well, maybe that is something that the Republicans snuck into our talking points. But it turned out that wasn't true.  There is a provision calling for ``repairing the historic oppression of . . . youth.'' That is sort of what this whole Green New Deal seems to focus on--accepting responsibility in a debate for things that really don't make the kind of sense one would want them to make as you move toward legislation. They don't really say what the ``historic oppression of youth'' was. Probably that is not related to the economy or the environment or the greenness of the Green New Deal.  But even if we agree that these ideas are good ideas, the other question is this: How much is it going to cost?  The American Action Forum looked at the biggest parts of the legislation, and they estimated that the total would run anywhere from $51 trillion to $94 trillion over 10 years. To put this in perspective, the Congress right now appropriates about $1.5 trillion a year. We spend more than that through programs that are in place like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, but we appropriate $1.5 trillion a year. If the estimates of the Green New Deal are right, that would suddenly become $5 trillion to $9 trillion a year. That is a pretty good multiplier of $1.5 trillion a year--six times, in fact, of what we are spending now--at the $9 trillion level. That works out to be about $65,000 per family per year. That would probably be more government than we could afford, but that is how it works out.  There is nothing that talks about how families are supposed to come up with their share of the bill.  While some of the ideas in the Green New Deal--Medicare for all or a job for everybody, guaranteed by the government--sound like good ideas, I don't think they are going to stand the test of the debate. I think that is one of the reasons that maybe the other side doesn't want to have the debate.  Some talk about: Well, maybe we will all vote present or we will not vote at all.  I think it is pretty hard to defend what you are out there talking about when you are not willing to come to the floor and talk about it. That is a debate we are going to have. I suspect we are going to have it sometime this month, and I look forward to engaging in that debate.  This week, we are having another debate on nominees. Right now, the debate is on the nominee for the Administrator of the EPA. There has been some discussion of the environment in the debate on the Administrator of the EPA. Next, we are going to go to someone to serve on the TVA commission. This is somebody who has been voted out of committee two times in bipartisan voice votes and never allowed to have a vote in the Senate.  I will remind my colleagues again that under President Reagan, the average time in days from when a person was voted out of committee--and remember, as all of us on the floor would know, the committee is where questions are asked, and the background check has been completed. That may take a substantial amount of time, depending on the nominee and how complicated their information is--sometimes less time, sometimes more. That has all happened in the committee.  Under President Reagan, the average number of days from the time a person was voted out of committee until they were voted on, on the floor was 5. The total number of times the majority had to file cloture to get that vote was less than a handful in the entire first 2 years.  For President Trump, the average number of days for a nominee to be voted on is 55, and the majority leader had to file cloture 128 times even to get a vote. We are going through some of those votes this week. The 30 hours of debate almost never includes debate about the nominee who is using up floor time that could be used for debating how we spend our money, how we defend our country, or what our foreign policy oversight responsibilities are going to be.  We are going to continue to look at the options and continue to talk to our friends on the other side about how 60 Senators can work together to change the rules in a way that they would be changed going forward to get the rules back more to the days of Ronald Reagan, George Herbert Walker Bush, Bill Clinton, and all of their predecessors, where nominees were never used as a way to use up time. Nominees were never held hostage so that other legislation or debate couldn't occur.  We are working hard to find 60 of us who want to return to a time when legislative priorities in the Senate still had the protections of the minority that have always been there, but those protections couldn't be used to the disadvantage of people who have stepped up and are willing to serve and are often voted out of committee on a bipartisan basis, only to be held up on the floor.  I look forward to the debate on the Green New Deal. I look forward to the other debates we are going to have on the floor of the Senate this year.  For the people who are willing to serve, who have been reported out of committee, who have been thoroughly questioned and investigated but can't get that vote and get to work, that is not what we want to do. That is not who we should want to be. I hope we can work together to find a way to change that rule as well.  I see my good friend, the Senator from Hawaii, is here. We are working on some things together right now that we would like to get to the floor and have those bills voted on later.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri. I thank him for his leadership and levelheadedness.  As he is on his way out, I will say that I think the current way we deal with nominees is not tenable. I imagine a scenario where we have a Democratic President, and it will take even longer than it is currently taking to confirm nominees. I think there are a number of us on both sides of the aisle who are open to modifying the way we operate. For me, the blue-slip question is a redline. I think what they are doing with the blue slips undermines the individual ability for any Senator to have their say, especially as it relates to the circuit courts, but I think there is an opportunity to have a conversation.  On climate generally, I am looking forward to a debate, but it is very difficult to debate in the Senate when only one party proffers a proposal. I don't mean this as rhetorical flourish. I don't mean this as a personal accusation or a partisan attack. It is just a fact that there are no climate proposals coming from the Senators who are Republican. There are zero. So they are trying to have a debate about a resolution which was nonbinding and which was signed by 12 Senators. I get it, but I think, given that this is the world's greatest deliberative body, we ought to have a proper debate about climate change.  We are actually in a climate emergency. This is the most important moment in the world's history as it relates to this particular crisis. We are sitting here trying to score points about an FAQ that was posted on a new Congresswoman's website and trying to make fun of each other and say: They are going to ban cows and ice cream. It is very silly, and it is not worthy of the seriousness of the moment.  I would ask my Republican colleagues--I see a number of them who take the debt, foreign policy, cyber security, personal privacy, and the rules of the Senate very seriously. They are very levelheaded human beings with a seriousness of purpose. Yet when it comes to climate change, it gets into this goofy thing where they are doing everything except debating climate change and what ought to be done about it.  We spent 5, maybe 10 years trying to get most Republicans to concede that this problem exists at all. Now a lot of them are feeling comfortable saying: Yes, this problem exists, but all of the solutions proposed by Democrats are wrong.  That is fine, but I ask this question in all sincerity: What do Republican Senators propose to do about the climate crisis? What is your plan? If you don't like cap and trade; if you don't like a fee on carbon; if you don't like massive investment in green technology and clean technology; if you don't like the extension of the investment tax credit and the production tax credit; if you don't like our solution; if you don't like being part of the Paris climate accord--which, by the way, is nonbinding, which means we get to decide what our pathway is to clean energy. It is not as though the U.N. gets to tell us what to do. It gives us leverage to make sure that as we move forward toward clean energy, the other countries don't cheat. It actually gives us leverage in this situation.  If you don't like our solutions, that is fine. This is the world's greatest deliberative body. This is where the greatest debates in U.S. history have happened. Yet, maybe 19 times out of 20, I have come down to the floor to talk about climate change, and there were Members on this side of the aisle and zero Members on the other side of the aisle. Again, I don't mean this as an attack; I just want a real debate.  I am looking at the Senator from Georgia. We have had robust discussions about debt and deficits and the way we try to avoid shutdowns and sequester and all the rest of it. When it comes to climate change, everybody gets really goofy. Everybody puts on their partisan uniform and refuses to engage. If this debate about the Green New Deal offers us an opportunity to talk about the planetary crisis, then I am happy for it.  We are in debate time on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead the EPA, so it might be helpful to know the origins of the Agency.  In the 1960s, the state of the environment was catastrophic. Millions of freshwater fish and rivers around the country were being poisoned by insecticides, hurting consumer trust and the countless fishermen and families who made a living that way. Pollution was so bad that debris floating in the Cuyahoga River actually caught on fire, causing thousands of dollars in property damage. The water in Lake Superior became so toxic from companies' dumping asbestos-laden waste that local communities had to start filtering their own water. Think about that. People could drink the water from their local reservoirs unfiltered until industrial pollution came along.  This was the path our country was on. Pollution was destroying many of the most beautiful places in the country and, maybe more importantly, putting the health of the public at risk.  A scientist named Rachel Carson came along and changed everything when she wrote a book that helped the United States see that we couldn't go on like this. Her book was a call for change, and millions of Americans, on a bipartisan basis, demanded change.  There was a predictable backlash. Here is what one industry spokesman said as public opinion began to coalesce around addressing pollution:       The major claims of Miss Rachel Carson's book ``Silent      Spring'' are gross distortions of the actual facts,      completely unsupported by scientific, experimental evidence,      and general practical experience in the field. Her suggestion      that pesticides are in fact biocides destroying all life is      obviously absurd in the light of the fact that without      selective biologicals, these compounds would be completely      useless.  This controversy went on for the next few years. The public, the science, and the reality pointed toward the truth, but a few loud voices tried to stop the country from making progress. They said that Rachel Carson distorted the facts, that the science wasn't there, and that there was no need to rush judgment.  The U.S. Government moved forward anyway and began to lay the foundation for a new America--one that would preserve and protect our country and its resources for the next generation.  In 1970, President Nixon united several offices and bureaus already in the Federal Government into one single agency, the EPA. The EPA was charged with protecting the Nation's health and being the steward of the environment. It has a legacy of fulfilling that mission. The Agency ended the use of a dangerous pesticide called DDT. It found a solution to acid rain, which was once a major issue for fish, forests, and farming. It took on secondhand smoke, banning smoking in indoor public places.  Thanks to the EPA, Rachel Carson's ``fable for tomorrow'' did not become a reality, but here we are decades later facing another environmental crisis, one that affects the United States and every other Nation on this planet, and I am worried that we are not going to do the right thing this time.  Instead of facing head-on and in a bipartisan way the biggest crisis in the planet's history, the party in power is not just ignoring the problem; they are making it worse. And they are doing it by nominating and confirming people like Andrew Wheeler. This is someone who said: ``Manmade global warming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.'' This is the guy to head the EPA. He says manmade global warming is a hoax. This is someone who was formally the vice president of the Washington Coal Club, who lobbied for coal companies.  We are in a planetary emergency, and Republicans want someone who is advancing the interests of top polluters to be the Nation's chief environmental steward so that he can continue to advance the interest of the top polluters. Again, it is not just that they are ignoring climate change, which would be bad enough; it is that they are aggressively, proudly, gleefully sometimes, making it worse.  Researchers at Harvard found that the EPA's recent plans to gut the Clean Power Plan will lead to more greenhouse gas emissions. Their plan will be worse for climate than if they did nothing at all. Think about that. If the EPA did nothing at all, it would be better than what they are doing now. This is the result of Mr. Wheeler's leadership, which has until now been in an Acting Director capacity.  During the Presidency of Ronald Reagan, the EPA was led by Anne Gorsuch Burford, who ended up resigning in scandal. President Reagan nominated as her replacement William Ruckelshaus, whom people trusted to do the job and stabilize the EPA. He was a moderate. He was a steady hand. The EPA could use a steady hand after Scott Pruitt, who promoted the interests of polluters over the health of the American people and who crossed many ethical lines. Yet Andrew Wheeler is no Ruckelshaus. That much is clear from his time at the EPA. Under his leadership, EPA inspections are at a 10-year low. EPA fines are at a 25-year low. Restrictions on new coal plants have been eliminated. Limits on methane pollution are in the process of being rolled back. In other words, polluters are getting their way. That is great news for people who own oil and gas companies, but it is horrible news for people with asthma, for farmers who are trying to get through the worst drought season seen in a century, and for small businesses that are losing customers because of fires.  Listen, climate change is here. It is hurting everything from local economies, to public health, to national security, and the Republicans have decided that the best person to lead the Agency to do something about it is a coal lobbyist. It would be funny if it were not so outrageous.  The Democrats have a plan for climate change. We have ideas to invest in clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure. We have bills on investment and production tax credits, solar energy, wind energy, conservation and efficiency, carbon pricing, and planting trees, and we have stood together against nominations like this one. It is time for the Republicans, if not to stand with us, to at least then stand on the other side against us and engage in this great debate. What are we going to do with climate change? We have proposals, and they have none.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise to talk about a crisis in my home State and indeed five other States across the Southeast. I rise to talk about disasters in California and to talk about our friends in Puerto Rico.  On October 10, 2018, Hurricane Michael made landfall on the Florida Panhandle as a category 4 hurricane. It was one of the strongest storms to ever hit the United States. Over the next few hours, Hurricane Michael barreled through Florida and tore through southwest Georgia. In a matter of minutes, homes were flattened, tracks of timber were destroyed, and farmers' crops lay down in the field. People's lives were radically affected forever.  This hurricane hit at exactly the time of year when most crops were ready for harvest. It doesn't matter if they were peanuts, cotton, or pecans--they were all just beautiful this year. As a matter of fact, in the State of Georgia, I grew up working on our family's farm there, and I have to say the cotton crop last year was probably the best I had ever seen. It was almost cruel. Today, agriculture is Georgia's top industry and our No. 1 economic driver. Before the hurricane, farmers in my State were expecting a record harvest. Instead, their crops were completely destroyed.  Shortly after the hurricane hit, President Trump, Vice President Pence, and Secretary of Agriculture Perdue all came down to Georgia. Together, we toured the devastation and heard from farmers and local officials about the tough road of recovery ahead. Some farmers said they could clean up, replant, and have a crop next year as long as they had adequate resources. Other farmers were not so lucky.  Georgia is the top pecan-producing State in the country. One of our largest pecan farms is owned by two brothers in Bainbridge, which the Vice President and I personally visited. We personally saw the damage in their fields. Some 800 acres of pecan trees were gone. I cannot describe to you what that looks like. On the ground was a solid carpet--if you can imagine this--of mature, beautiful, inch-long pecans that were ready to be harvested but were on the ground, ruined.  One brother said:       The farmer in me wants to farm this land, but there's no      way I can make it. Next year is the year I'll lose it,      because we're not like the cotton guy. Nothing against them,      but they get to replant a seed next year and have a crop. I      don't.  The problem is that the pecan crop can be annually insured, but there is no insurance product for insuring pecan trees. If these two brothers replant, it could take 7 to 10 years for the trees to mature enough to even generate a minimum revenue. Most likely, full production would take over 12 years. For them, this is truly a generational loss.  The other brother said:       My brother and I built this business from nothing. We will      make it. We may not be in the pecan business anymore, but      we will be doing something else. We are fighters. [Our      families are committed to this land.] You just have to go      on.  When they saw the devastation, President Trump and Vice President Pence stepped up to the plate and made a commitment to our agriculture community.  President Trump said: ``Farmers really got hurt here, especially in Georgia, but we're going to get it taken care of.''  Vice President Pence said:       We will rebuild these crops and these communities. We will      restore southwest Georgia. We will restore the Sunbelt region      bigger and better than ever before.  This afternoon, I am here to say that the Vice President and the President are living up to their word. After this disaster relief was caught up in the political nightmare of funding the last 25 percent of this year's budget, we now have the opportunity to put this standalone supplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the Senate. The President and Vice President have been absolutely resolute in their support of getting aid to the victims of these disasters. They are now asking Congress to pass this all-inclusive disaster relief bill right now.  The State of Georgia has already stepped up and offered tax credits, short-term financing, and other forms of direct assistance to those who have been impacted, but they have only scratched the surface. The people of Georgia have come together and helped their neighbors, served meals to each other, and assisted first responders in their recovery efforts.  In Florida alone, then-Governor Rick Scott, who is now our colleague here on the Senate floor, was in the race for this Senate seat, and he actually suspended his campaign to devote all of his time, in his responsibility as the Governor, to lead the effort of analyzing the damage in Florida and determining what needed to be done. He can speak directly to the need. He is a cosponsor of this bill, I might add.  However, despite efforts by Senator Isakson and others and me in our State, this Senate body has yet to take action on disaster relief for the agriculture community in the Southeast. Our farmers simply cannot wait any longer. The situation in my State is dire. I would say it is the same across the South. Because revenue from the 2018 harvest was destroyed, bankers can't lend money to farmers who right now are asking to borrow money to put seed in the ground, to fertilize the ground, and to prepare the ground for next year's crop. It is as simple as that. Growers cannot replant because they can't get their financial houses in order because we haven't adopted a resolution for last year's harvest that they were not able to achieve. Rural communities are suffering, and in many places, economic activity is at an absolute standstill as it waits for the Federal Government--this body and the House of Representatives--to do its job.  For some in my State, the timing of assistance is not just a matter of putting a crop in the ground this year; it is a matter of potentially never putting a crop in the ground again. If we do not help these people right now, they may lose their businesses and livelihoods through no fault of their own. That is the reality we are facing here. The people in my State have asked me to utilize every sphere of influence, turn over every stone, and exhaust all options to get disaster relief right now.  We are past the time when this should have gotten done. I have spoken with the President many times about this. His commitment to our farmers is unwavering. Just last Monday night, he said: David, get it done. He called me again on Saturday night before he left for Vietnam. He said: David, what do we have to do to get this bill across the Senate floor? Talk to our friends in the House, and make sure that everything that is needed is in.  Senator Isakson, I, and several other Senators have introduced a supplemental disaster relief bill on the floor of the Senate, and President Trump has agreed to sign it. Our bill includes disaster relief for agriculture. It also provides additional funds for Georgia and other States like Florida, Alabama, the Carolinas, Alaska, Hawaii, and California that have battled natural disasters over the last year on their own. It also builds on the Trump administration's past efforts and includes the remaining funding for Puerto Rico.  Both the House and Senate have previously supported similar proposals. They should be even more inclined to do so now that it is not tied up with the overall 2019 budget drama. This is a standalone supplemental bill that includes those things that people on both sides of this body agreed to and voted for just last year. This bipartisan package is a win for our farmers. It is a win for families and businesses that were devastated by historic hurricanes in the Southeast and wildfires in the West. It is a win for the people of Puerto Rico whom the President has previously helped. He was committed to including that in this bill.  I sincerely hope this body will move quickly and pass this disaster relief bill without further delay. I humbly ask each of my colleagues in this body for their individual support and for their vote in this disaster relief package that will save hundreds, if not thousands, of farming families in my home State from having to give up what they love, and that is farming the land that in many cases they inherited from their families. In other cases, people who graduated from HBCUs--some of our brightest young people--borrowed money to buy the land or are leasing the land, and they are in danger of losing this dream of making a living on the ground in Georgia.  Our country and our people are counting on us to get this done, and time is of the essence.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I come to the floor in opposition to Andrew Wheeler's nomination to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.  Americans across this country depend on EPA to protect their public health, yet under this administration, EPA has failed again and again to reassure my constituents that their basic rights to breathe in clean air and sip clean water are being prioritized.  Listen, I am proud that EPA's Region 5 office is headquartered in Chicago. Region 5 has led the country in enforcing the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and other bedrock environmental policies that Congress has passed. But under Mr. Wheeler and this administration, EPA has made it harder for the scientists, engineers, and public health experts in Region 5 to do their jobs.  EPA is severely understaffed and underfunded, and in 2018, major enforcement actions dropped to their lowest levels in more than 10 years. Last year, EPA competed fewer than 11,000 inspections and evaluations of polluters across the country--the lowest number in almost two decades.  In 2018, EPA sent just 123 civil pollution violation cases to the Justice Department for prosecution. That is about 40 percent less than the annual average during the Obama administration. So, sadly, it should come as no surprise that a report from the Environmental Integrity Project this month found that communities across the country are now being put at risk of exposure to dangerous contaminants.  To make matters worse, the EPA's enforcement workforce has been shrinking for years, and the Trump administration wants to cut it back even further.  These cutbacks are leaving communities, especially low-income communities and those of color, exposed to public health risks. Meanwhile, polluters are being let off the hook for serious violations of the law.  I have seen firsthand what happens when EPA fails to enforce our laws and protect public health. It causes fear and confusion. For months, residents in Willowbrook, IL, have lived in fear that the air they breathe in has been making their family sick.  Here is a little background. A facility in their community has been releasing cancer-causing emissions for decades. Unfortunately, even since EPA discovered just how toxic this chemical was years ago--years ago--they have refused to issue new regulations updating safety standards based on the latest science.  Making matters even worse, EPA officials refused to notify local public health or elected officials about their discovery, leaving communities in the dark even while their health is at risk, leaving more families more likely to get sick, leaving more children more likely to die.  As a mother, this is heartbreaking. As a Senator, this is outrageous.  When Willowbrook residents first started to raise concerns, EPA wasn't the least bit transparent. The Agency had to be pushed by Senator Durbin, other Members of the Illinois congressional delegation, and me just to hold community forums.  My office also received alarming information alleging that senior political appointees instructed EPA personnel not to inspect any facility in Region 5 that emits the same carcinogen found at this facility. If true, this type of political interference is beyond unacceptable. If true, it is happening on Mr. Wheeler's watch.  I have asked EPA to take several steps to fix this crisis, and I am still waiting for their response.  In the absence of leadership from EPA, Senator Durbin and I have authored two pieces of legislation to ensure that this kind of crisis never happens again.  Here is what Gabriela, a resident of Willowbrook, said when she saw the list of health problems associated with this facility: ``It was like reading our medical history.''  Since she moved to her home in 2009, Gabriela has suffered from intense headaches, dizziness, nausea, inability to concentrate, and memory loss. She has found it difficult to read through briefs and almost instantly forgets movie plots and even some conversations.  Both of her children, who have lived in the house for most of their lives, have had respiratory problems since they were little. Her 12-year-old daughter has often coughed to the point of vomiting and has developed a bone cyst.  One of her 9-year-old daughter's classmates was recently diagnosed with leukemia, as was Gabriella's next-door neighbor, an otherwise healthy man in his early fifties.  Another woman I have gotten to know from Willowbrook is named Neringa. She told me that when she and her husband were moving to Chicago 5 years ago, they picked their home because it seemed like a place where their children would be safe.  She went on:       You look for sexual predators, good schools, taxes. You      don't think you would have to look at air and water. You feel      like it is the one thing in our country we wouldn't have to      think about.  Exposure from toxic pollution is a matter of life and death for these residents. It was uncovered only when career civil servants did their job and flagged a risk they observed in a routine model that EPA publishes.  I am extremely concerned that other areas in Illinois could face similar issues and that other kids in other communities could be breathing in air full of cancer-causing chemicals when they are playing on the swings at recess or walking home from school later that afternoon.  I need EPA to respond to the requests I have made on behalf of Lake County and actually conduct the kind of monitoring that exposed the problem in Willowbrook there and in every community that may be at risk.  Not far from Willowbrook, residents in Chicago have also been facing several public health threats for decades.  Chicago, IL, is the birthplace of Hazel Johnson, the ``Mother of the Environmental Justice Movement,'' a pioneer of environmental justice activism on the South Side of Chicago.  She founded People for Community Recovery in 1979 in an effort to get asbestos out of the buildings in her community. Soon she managed to trace air and water pollution in her community to nearby industry, which was using the predominantly lower income African-American community as a dumping ground.  Hazel Johnson knew what I know: Every American has a right to breathe in safe air, drink clean water, and live on uncontaminated land, no matter where they live, no matter the color of their skin, no matter their tax bracket.  Yet I still hear about manganese pollution, petcoke, particulate matter, and lead exposure from these residents on a daily basis.  Chicago residents deserve--no, they need--environmental justice. But for some reason, this administration has dismantled the office that is supposed to lead this work, even trying to eliminate EPA's environmental justice funding and drive out the office's top talent.  Lead exposure is an issue that impacts low-income families and communities of color disproportionately. I had high hopes that I would be able to work with Mr. Wheeler on the administration's response to this crisis. Yet after months and months of delays, I am very disappointed by their so-called plan.  Mr. Wheeler's lead action plan falls short of what was promised and the ``war on lead'' his predecessor declared. This is not a plan with goals, strategies, and deadlines. Instead, it is a repackaged version of a report published under the Obama administration. Little has changed, other than the window dressing.  What disappointed me most was that the administration appears to be walking back our goal of eliminating lead exposure, settling simply for reducing it. That is unacceptable.  Even to this day, in a post-Flint crisis world, too many in power are sitting idly by as countless Americans are exposed to lead. More than 6 million homes get water from lead service lines, and 24 million homes have lead hazards in paint, dust, or soil. Nearly half a million children have elevated levels of lead in their blood.  Let's be clear. For children, there is no safe level of lead allowable in drinking water. Even low levels can cause permanent brain damage in kids, lowering IQ, and inflicting other cognitive damage. Imagine if your child were one of those who had gotten sick because the EPA refused to take action on such an obvious crisis. Imagine how infuriating, how devastating that would be.  We must make meaningful progress in tackling sources of exposure, and EPA must take up an aggressive, comprehensive, and practical strategy.  I know we can make real progress in reducing lead in our society, but the new lead action plan is a missed opportunity to advance those efforts.  I also believe that Mr. Wheeler has far too many conflicts of interest to be running the EPA. As a former lobbyist for Murray Energy, Mr. Wheeler has worked closely with the industries he would regulate as the leader of the EPA. It is well reported that Mr. Wheeler's former firm lobbied the EPA on efforts Wheeler now oversees.  Even after he took temporary reins of the EPA, he made no secret of meeting with former clients and fossil fuel industry representatives. CNN and Reuters have both reported that Wheeler is heavily prioritizing meetings with industry over anyone else and has attended more than 50 meetings with companies or industry groups that EPA regulates.  If this news doesn't alarm you, it may be because corruption is becoming routine under this administration. After all, just earlier this week, the Washington Post reported that the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation, Bill Wehrum, has been routinely meeting with former clients in the fossil fuel industry from his not-so-long-ago lobbying days.  I placed a hold on Mr. Wehrum's nomination because I did not think he could be trusted with our Nation's air. I feel the same way about Mr. Wheeler's leading the EPA.  According to the Sierra Club, every third day during his first 100 days as Acting Administrator, Mr. Wheeler either, one, rolled back a new climate policy; two, ignored or contradicted science; three, met with big polluters; four, limited the EPA's ability to protect us from pollution; or, five, gave in to corporate polluter demands--all of that in just his first 3 months and change. Imagine what would happen if we gave him the reins for good.  Mr. Wheeler's position on climate change policy alone is disqualifying. Consider, for example, his attack on the Clean Power Plan. Climate change is a major threat to our environment, our economy, and our national security--something that even Donald Trump's own intelligence officials admit.  My home State of Illinois is already experiencing the consequences of inaction. Growing seasons are changing, heat waves are increasing, and extreme floods are becoming more frequent and more severe. Just this December we had a hurricane. Mitigating these effects will require sensible policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and invest in clean energy.  Under the Clean Water Act, EPA is legally required to limit carbon pollution from powerplants, pollution that we know is the primary driver of climate change.  That is why the Obama administration established a Clean Power Plan--to provide States the flexibility they need to meet a national goal of 32 percent reductions in carbon pollution by 2030. This plan was the culmination of robust and rigorous public participation, and EPA received millions of comments supporting the program from States, through its utilities, communities of color, Tribes, environmental groups, labor unions, and the public at large.  The Clean Power Plan was not only good for the environment; it was good for the economy, too. In Illinois, residents are expected to save an average of up to 4 percent on electricity bills by 2030. Illinois energy efficiency investments alone are estimated to grow our economy by $2 billion in that same year, and we lead the Midwest in clean energy jobs.  But no matter the obvious global, national, and economic benefits, Mr. Wheeler has led the administration's efforts to roll back the Clean Power Plan. His replacement proposal would adversely impact public health and lead to as many as 1,400 premature deaths from increased soot, up to 15,000 new cases of upper respiratory problems, and 100,000 missed school and work days annually by 2030.  Internationally, this proposal would leave the United States further behind our allies that have taken aggressive action on climate change. The proposal also fails low-income communities and communities of color, which bear the brunt of our environmental and public health burdens. Unlike the Clean Power Plan, this platform doesn't even require States to engage environmental justice and community groups in their plan development processes. It also fails to encourage States to conduct environmental justice analysis of their own as they develop implementation plans.  EPA should be working to strengthen policies like the Clean Power Plan. It is more than troubling that Mr. Wheeler and the Trump administration are instead seeking to repeal them entirely. Now is not the time to move backward.  Here is what Evan, who grew up in Libertyville, IL, shared with me:       I write because I am concerned about the future. The future      of the world, the future for the United States and my own      future. At this time, I feel that perhaps the greatest threat      to that future is climate change. The current      Administration's stance towards the issue has discouraged me      to no end, and I can't help but despair as the President      makes light of this existential threat to the wellbeing of      the planet.       I know, of course, that not all lawmakers share the      President's stance towards this issue. Please, make some      noise.  Evan, I hear you. I hear your fear, and I want you to know that I believe the Nation should be focused on building a clean energy economy and a climate-safe future for your generation. I hear you, and I am going to make that noise for you.  I am also angry at EPA's abuse of the small refinery waiver program under the renewable fuel standard. The RFS includes a policy to help small refineries that cannot afford to comply with the RFS. Before Donald Trump took power, this policy was rarely used. Under the Trump administration, however, nearly every exemption application has been secretly granted. This includes applications from large, multibillion dollar companies like Exxon and Chevron that are earning record profits. These companies' CEOs have even pointed to hardship waivers on earnings clauses as contributing to their profitability.  The administration's stance reduces incentives for blending--slashing demands for biofuels and feedstocks--actively hurting farmers and biofuels companies. These waivers could hurt the markets for years to come, holding back homegrown biofuels while creating windfall profits for large oil refiners--the exact opposite of this administration's promise to voters.  Let's be blunt. EPA is taking money out of farmers' hands and giving it to billionaire oil companies. These actions come at a time when biofuel producers and farmers across our country are already hurting. Farm income is at its lowest since 2006, and retaliatory trade measures from China threaten to deepen the crisis.  Yet early reports indicate that the small refinery waivers EPA has granted under President Trump and Mr. Wheeler will reduce demand for biofuels by billions. Over the past 6 months, we have seen more ethanol plants sold, idled, or closed than ever before. When I asked Mr. Wheeler during the confirmation hearing about EPA's apparent change in policy to now seemingly granting every exemption application, he made excuses justifying them. We need a leader at the EPA who is going to stand up for our farmers, not capitulate to the demands of Big Oil.  We also need a leader at the EPA who is going to protect the Great Lakes. The 1,000 employees in Region 5 work tirelessly to protect the environment, health, and safety of Americans living in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin. They live, work, and raise their families in the communities they protect, and they are leaders in the fields of water quality, Superfund cleanup, and Great Lakes restoration.  Region 5 is also home to the Great Lakes Program Office, which ensures that we keep the promises we made to Canada under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. It also leads the Nation's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which has funded more than 2,000 projects that improve water quality, protect wildlife, and clean up toxic pollutants that threaten our water supply.  To date, the program has invested more than $2.2 billion in Great Lakes restoration projects. Coordinated in both the United States and Canada, GLRI sets the standards for interagency and international cooperation. Every $1 invested in Great Lakes restoration results in a $2 return in the form of increased fishing, tourism, and home values. But in addition to enduring a shutdown, the employees in Region 5 who lead these programs have been bought out, undermined, and reorganized into positions they are not suited for, and that is unacceptable.  What is also unacceptable is Mr. Wheeler's attacks on science and science integrity. Science does not have a political affiliation. Science is about learning, and it never stands still. It gives us the building blocks to help us increase our knowledge over time and to find ever-better solutions to the challenges we face. Unfortunately, this EPA has led the administration's attacks on science when it doesn't fit with their pro-polluter agenda.  What is at stake is not just our health and future but also America's standing and influence in the world. Just this month, EPA released the names of eight new members of its science advisory board. I am concerned that several of the new members represent interests who seek to undermine the independence and quality of the scientific advice given to the EPA. University researchers are now in the minority on the board, while the number of industry-affiliated members and members listed as consultants has increased.  Here is how the Union of Concerned Scientists summarized the new appointments made by Wheeler to the Science Advisory Board. Take Dr. John Christy. He has a reputation for controversial climate research and denying the evidence of global warming.  Then, there is Dr. Brant Ulsh, a consultant who argues that radiation at low doses isn't a big deal, contrary to the conclusions of the National Academy of Science.  New member Dr. Richard Williams has received compensation from the American Chemistry Council's formaldehyde panel, which was set up to obfuscate the health impacts of this carcinogen. He is also on the board of trustees of the International Life Sciences Institute, an industry-funded organization that is notorious for pushing out shoddy nutrition science.  Dr. Barbara Beck is a consultant with Gradient, which has itself earned a reputation for helping industry defend their products with favorable scientific studies. Beck herself helped to write a paper arguing that exposure to lead at low doses is not necessarily harmful to children, which is in stark contrast to the CDC's assessment that there is no safe level of exposure to lead.  The common thread among these individuals is that they are practitioners of the widely used disinformation playbook. They frequently work to inject uncertainty into science by criticizing risk assessments and underlying models. They argue that exposure to pollutants at low doses is not worth worrying about. That is not true. Pollution is pollution, and it is bad for communities, and it is bad for public health.  I also want to spend some time discussing the administration's new clean water rule. For more than 45 years, the Clean Water Act has preserved, protected, and restored our Nation's most important natural resource and radically transformed how our Nation uses water. That is why admirers of CWA appropriately labeled this law as one of the most successful public health initiatives ever enacted. Continued success of the CWA requires developing a clear, concise rule for determining which bodies of water are protected by the Clean Water Act. However, Mr. Wheeler and the Trump administration have proposed a rule that fails to provide the clear-cut certainty requested by my constituents. It would cancel protections for drinking water sources of tens of millions of people. It would also cancel protections for streams and wetlands that provide habitat for wildlife and protect communities from flooding.  Communities across the country, particularly low-income communities and communities of color, already struggle to access clean water. Mr. Wheeler's proposed rule will make it even harder for these communities. Mr. Wheeler's water rule puts the profits of corporate polluters before our health and clean water for our families.  Alan, from Wheeling, IL, wrote to me and said:       This is insanity. There is nothing more important than      protecting the sources of water that many people in this      country drink from.       No source of drinking water should be open for pollution or      destruction, but that is exactly what this proposal does by      stripping protections from critical streams and wetlands      across the country.       Senator Duckworth, please do anything that is possible to      protect our environment and industries that depend upon clean      water.  Alan, thank you for writing to me. I agree with you. This rule makes no scientific, legal, public health, or fiscal sense.  Another constituent, Dave from Rockford, shared with me similar concerns. He wrote:       Clean water is not a political issue. Protecting our      watersheds and ensuring that clean, fresh water is available      for fish, farms and communities is not an option--it's a      responsibility.       I cannot think of a more enjoyable satisfaction [than] just      standing in a clean river, seeing all the life teaming in it,      and knowing that our hard work is paying off.  Dave is right. Streams and wetlands work as natural filters and sponges, keeping our drinking water supplies safe, while reducing the impact of floods.  Like our water, I am concerned by this administration's attacks on clean air. One group that comes to mind that has been fighting for our clean air is Mom's Clean Air Task Force. They are a group of moms who know how painful it is when their child can't play outside because they have asthma or there is smog outside. They are fighting for cleaner air and stronger kids.  They list ten reasons they oppose Mr. Wheeler, and among those reasons are his attacks on rules to control mercury pollution, to make our cars more fuel efficient, and to reduce smog.  Mr. Wheeler's attacks on these priorities hits close to home for me. Currently, the rate of asthma in Illinois is 13 percent higher than the national average. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America ranks Chicago in the top 10 percent of the most challenging places to live with asthma. Asthma is hitting the frontline neighborhoods in Chicago harder than in many other places in the Nation, with asthma rates in some neighborhoods soaring as high as 33 percent. As the climate gets hotter, air pollution, allergies, and temperatures will trigger more asthma attacks in children.  I want to end on a high note. I commend Mr. Wheeler for following through on his promise to make himself accessible and to conduct proactive outreach. Compared to Mr. Pruitt, he is an upgrade in terms of professionalism, but that is an incredibly low bar.  At the end of the day, my constituents are depending on me to protect them from pollution, even if it upsets some in industry. I believe we need an Administrator who is ready to fight for our kids, to fight for the Great Lakes, to fight for the civil servants that work at EPA, and to fight for every American's right to clean air, clean water, and a healthy environment. I believe EPA will achieve its mission when it requires rigorous enforcement when human health is at stake.  Mr. Wheeler believes that public health must be balanced against the health of corporations and industry interests who always want less rules, less oversight, and certainly less enforcement. That is why I must vote no.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, this week the Senate is debating the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  I am going to make this short because this is bad news for anybody who wants the Environmental Protection Agency to live up to its fundamental mission; that is, to protect the public health so our citizens, from sea to shining sea, can breathe clean air and drink clean water.  In my view, Andrew Wheeler is Scott Pruitt without an appetite for luxury travel on the taxpayers' dime--yet another Trump appointee doing the bidding of the dirtiest, most powerful industry in America, no matter what physical harm it might do to the people of our country.  To me, the fundamental obligation of an EPA Administrator should be to make sure we don't compromise our health and the environment. Regrettably, Mr. Wheeler has spent his career doing essentially the opposite.  Given what he has done during his time as acting head of the Agency, he has already proven what sort of backward-thinking Administrator he will be. In fact, I think it would be fair to say Andrew Wheeler is sure to be ``Administrator Rollback.''  During his time as Acting-Administrator, he's rolled back fuel economy standards that reduce pollution and help drivers save money at the pump. Not even the car companies support him on that. He is rolling back the rules designed to stop dirty powerplants from belching toxic gases into the air. He is rolling back rules designed to protect workers from exposure on the job to dangerous chemicals that can cause heart attacks, for example. He is rolling back EPA enforcement--basic enforcement--of a host of safeguards that are already on the books.  Civil penalties against polluters are now at their lowest since 1994. Inspections of potentially toxic industrial sites amount to half of what they were just in 2010. Civil fines have plummeted on his watch. Judicial enforcement cases that have begun and are concluded have been cut in half. The Wheeler EPA is already letting environmental criminals off the hook. It is my view that these criminals are not creating victimless crimes--what they are doing is poisoning our communities, our workplaces, our air, and our water.  Perhaps what is most alarming about his appointment is that he essentially waves a hand of dismissal to the existential threat of climate change.  I have a lot of open-to-everybody townhall meetings in my State. We have now had more than 920. Just last week, I held five in different parts of our State. In counties where Donald Trump won and in counties where Hillary Clinton won, the issue of climate change comes up everywhere.  At the root of the questions I get in communities that span the philosophical spectrum is that people are terrified--terrified--of what climate change is going to bring. They see the news coming out of Washington. They see that the Trump administration isn't just waving the white flag of surrender on climate change. In effect, it almost feels as if the Trump people want to bring on those climate changes even faster. Anybody who is walking around in our communities and sees temperature shifts of more than 30 or 40 degrees on a dime is completely aware of what I am talking about, even if the Trump administration is not.  In my home State, when you talk about climate change, the first thing Oregonians think about are wildfires. These fires are not your grandfather's fires. They are bigger. They are hotter. They are more powerful.  Not too long ago, we actually had a fire leap the Columbia River--our magnificent Columbia River. This is noteworthy for a variety reasons but especially because our rivers historically have acted as fire bricks. Now we have these bigger and more powerful fires almost all year round, not just a few months in the summer, the way it used to be. These new megafires are extraordinary.  It is almost as if we are trying to get acclimated to the idea of clean air refugees--people who live near areas where fires break out, with ash built up on their cars like snow in the wintertime.  California has seen its own huge infernos causing horrible fatalities in the last few years. Nevada has seen it, Colorado and Washington as well. People are literally homeless, out and about in their communities, trying to just find a safe place for shelter.  Climate change is also not just about fires. Across the West, there is the threat of crippling drought. The hurricanes that battled the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico are intensifying and drowning our cities with rain. It seems like every day there is another report about how sea levels are rising faster than previously estimated.  Climate change is affecting wildlife in catastrophic ways. Entire ecosystems could be lost. This week, there were reports that an ice sheet larger than the island of Manhattan broke off from Antarctica. So the effects of climate change aren't some threat way off in the future. It is already a massive problem today. Americans feel it, and they see it in their communities again and again.  My wife and I are older parents. We have 11-year-old twins and a 6-year-old daughter. I--and I am sure there are plenty of other Senators--think about what their generation is going to be dealing with down the road. This is why there is so much grassroots energy out there about the Green New Deal, which I am proud to cosponsor.  I can tell you from the conversations I had in Oregon, people know what a grave threat climate change poses. They want action. My hope is that there are a variety of ways, like we saw with the original New Deal, in which we can find some common ground.  I am the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, which writes the tax laws. We have more than 40 separate tax breaks for energy that are on the books today, and most of them are dirty energy tax relics of yesteryear.  What I have proposed is that we basically throw those 40 energy tax breaks--relics of dirty energy--in the trash can and substitute three; one for clean energy, one for clean transportation fuel, and one for energy efficiency.  The Presiding Officer is new here. She is getting out and talking to Senators about a variety issues. I can tell her that what I will be saying to colleagues on the other side of the aisle is something like, my idea responds to what Republicans have been talking about, the need for fewer subsidies. We ought to have fewer subsidies for energy.  Why don't we try to work together, find common ground, and do it particularly on an issue that helps us to promote clean energy at a time of dramatic climate change? That is why I believe Andrew Wheeler is the wrong person to lead the EPA. Just when we need Democrats and Republicans to come together to find fresh ideas to combat climate change, he basically says that it really isn't a threat at all.  It really isn't a threat to Mr. Wheeler, and he is making the climate change challenge worse by basically suppressing the authority and the ability of the Agency to take this existential challenge head-on.  The mission of the EPA is all about protecting human health, fighting for clean air, fighting for clean water, and fighting on behalf of Americans from sea to shining sea.  Andrew Wheeler fights for those who endanger our health and pollute our air and water. This isn't a tough call. I am a no on a nomination that represents danger and going backward. I urge my colleagues to stay with me.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today because in 1869, 150 years ago, the Nebraska Legislature unanimously passed and our Governor signed legislation that established the University of Nebraska.  The Morrill-Land Grant Colleges Act, signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, provided Nebraska with land to establish colleges focused on agriculture and the mechanic arts. The university opened its doors in our State capital, Lincoln, where we honor President Lincoln's namesake.  Since then, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln has grown to an enrollment of over 25,000 students, providing over 5,000 new graduates to the workforce each year and over $2 billion in annual economic impact for Nebraska across our 93 counties.  The university holds a special place in my heart. I am a graduate of the university. Staying true to its roots, UNL remains a national leader in water, agriculture, and rural development research, helping to transform our State, which was once called the Great American Desert, into one of the greatest agricultural exporting regions in the world.  On top of equipping Nebraskans with the skills to feed the world, the university has emerged as a leading institution for early childhood education and national security and defense research.  The university's sports teams unite our Nebraska communities, and they fuel our pride in our great State. Whether it is to cheer on our five-time national championship winning football team at Memorial Stadium or at the Devaney Center to support one of our State's treasures, the five-time national champion women's volleyball team, Lincoln is filled with a sea of Husker red on game days.  What is more, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln leads the Nation with 333 Academic All-Americans across our Cornhusker sports teams.  The university is also important to the culture of our State, showcasing some of the best of the good life--attractions such as the State Museum, which is the largest natural history museum in Nebraska or the Larsen Tractor Test and Power Museum or the East Campus Dairy Store known across our State for its wonderful cheese and, of course, ice cream.  The university, like our State, has grown and accomplished much over the last century and a half, and that is why my colleague from Nebraska and I have introduced a Senate resolution recognizing UNL's 150th anniversary on February 15 of 2019.  This is a formal way for this body to extend our congratulations to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln on this special milestone in its history. I urge my colleagues to support the passage of the resolution because, as my colleague and I know so well, there is no place like Nebraska.  Here is to the next 150 years and beyond for the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  Madam President, I yield some time to my colleague from Nebraska so that he may make remarks on this resolution as well.  I yield the floor."

Senator Fischer is a tireless champion of our State and of this special university, her alma mater.  I am sad to admit in public that I am not a graduate of the University of Nebraska, but I had lied about my age for many, many years to be able to vend and sell concessions at Huskers sporting events before I was old enough to do it so that I could be deeply affiliated with this institution, even though I didn't graduate from there.  I salute my senior Senator and her leadership in drawing attention to this. I want to tell stories about Coach Osborne, who was my boyhood hero, about crying as a 12-year-old after the January 2, 1984, national championship game in Miami, about Scott Frost and how he is going to soon lead us back to the promised land, but I have already been warned by the Presiding Officer that the Senate has some informal unwritten rules that actually prohibit football evangelism on the floor.  I will move along to celebrate, with my senior Senator, our volleyball national championships, our bowling national championships, and the fact that Nebraska is or was once known as the Great American Desert, and we are now the most trade-dependent, export-dependent State per capita in the Union precisely because we live on the great Ogallala Aquifer, the most productive land anywhere on Earth and at any point in the history of the Earth.  We grow so much more food than we can ever conceivably consume that we feed the world from Nebraska, and a huge part of that is because of the ag extension programs of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. There are a lot of great Americans and great patriots who serve at the University of Nebraska on the faculty, in the administration, and donors and alumni and our current students, and the 150th anniversary is a great moment for our State. All 50 States have colleges and universities they are proud of, but there is no State that is more identified with its university than Nebraska. I would like to join my senior Senator and applaud her for her leadership in bringing this resolution today."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today to talk about the debate that we are having with regard to the nomination or, I should say, confirmation of the EPA Administrator.  All of us in this Chamber and the other body, the U.S. House of Representatives--frankly, anyone in government--has an obligation to act in accordance with a goal of being good stewards of the Earth. Some might call it creation care--care of God's creation.  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency, under its current leadership, is, in my judgment, failing to meet that obligation. From day one, the administration has prioritized gutting environmental protections and rolling back policies that had us on a path toward a more sustainable future.  From attacking the Clean Power Plan to weakening methane protection standards, this administration has repeatedly prioritized the interests of polluters over the health and wellness of the American people.  Andrew Wheeler, the nominee, if he is confirmed to run the EPA or, I should say, the Environmental Protection Agency, which we call the EPA--this assault on clean air, clean water, and so many other protections will continue if he is, in fact, confirmed.  Some of the most troubling EPA actions have come while Mr. Wheeler has been running the EPA in an acting capacity.  In recent weeks, the EPA has decided to move forward with a rollback of the clean car standard and to gut the mercury and air toxics rule. These moves will harm public health and the health of our children, in particular.  The American Lung Association reports that 5 Pennsylvania counties, 5 of our 67 counties, which are home to approximately 4 million people, rank among the top 25 counties most polluted by particulate matter year round.  Rolling back the clean car standards and clean air standards will cause more exposure to harmful pollutants that lead to increased mortality, respiratory problems, emergency room visits, and work-loss days.  As we know, the transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States. We also know that the MATS rule, the so-called mercury and air toxics rule, is an environmental and public health success story.  Mercury pollution is particularly harmful for unborn children, who are much more sensitive to exposure and who may suffer neurological and developmental problems.  Powerplant mercury emissions have declined by 90 percent because of the MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of schedule and at one-third of the projected cost. Let me say that again. Powerplant mercury emissions have declined by 90 percent because of the MATS rule. This was achieved ahead of schedule and at one-third of the scheduled cost.  Let me give testimony from two Pennsylvanians--partial testimonies, though they are from longer letters that they wrote to us.  Mollie Michel of South Philadelphia wrote to me, and I am quoting her:       As parents, my husband and I spend a lot of time making      sure our daughters are safe and healthy. We make sure they      eat healthy foods, get enough sleep, do their homework, and      treat each other and their peers with kindness and respect.      But the one thing we cannot control is the air they breathe.      For that, we rely upon our elected officials to enact the      policies that protect the health and well-being of my      children.  The only thing I would correct in Mollie's excerpt of her letter is that it is the obligation not just of elected officials but of appointed officials, as well--those confirmed by the U.S. Senate, in this case, the Administrator of the EPA. Of course, it is our duty, as elected officials, to make sure that we confirm people who will meet the legitimate expectations of a mom like Mollie.  Patrice from Gibsonia, PA, wrote to me to say:       As a mom of two boys, I am deeply concerned by the track      record of Acting Administrator Wheeler. He has spent his time      at EPA proposing and implementing dangerous rollbacks to and      attacks on pollution protections. He is putting our      children's health and future at risk.  So said Patrice of Gibsonia.  While we are on the subject of major threats to the environment, major threats to our communities, to our children, and to our families, we cannot forget about climate change itself. Climate change is a threat to the health and well-being of our children and future generations. We must take action to address the global climate crisis with a sense of urgency and determination. The effects of climate change are real and have become worse, and unless we take action, we are going to be in a position where it will be impossible to take any action if we do it too late.  We can address the challenge of climate change and continue to protect jobs. We can and we must do both. One is not exclusive of the other. We have already demonstrated that we can make advancements in clean energy and that it can happen quickly while also benefiting the economy and creating jobs.  According to the Business Council for Sustainable Energy and Bloomberg New Energy Finance, renewables--renewable sources of energy--now account for 18 percent of power generation in the United States, up from just 9 percent in 2008.  According to the 2018 U.S. Energy Employment Report, the wind and solar industries support three times as many jobs as oil and gas--three times as many jobs as oil and gas. According to S&P Global, battery storage cost for a 20-megawatt facility declined by 40 percent in 2018. So I think it is entirely possible, and the data proves it, to deal with this crisis, to meet our obligations, to continue to create and grow jobs, and also to make sure that our economy grows as well.  I live in a State where more than a generation ago we passed a State Constitution provision. Article I, section 27 of the Pennsylvania Constitution says in pertinent part that people have a right to clean air, pure water, and to the preservation of the natural scenic, historic, and aesthetic values of the environment. That constitutional provision goes on to say that we are trustees. We, the citizens of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, are the trustees of our natural resources, and they specifically talk about future generations.  That is my obligation, not only as a citizen of the Commonwealth and not only as an elected official but, I believe, as an American as well.  To confront these crises--whether it is attacks on clean power standards, clean air and clean water standards or whether it is the challenge of climate change itself--we need an EPA and an EPA Administrator who is totally committed to that same spirit that is set forth in that State constitutional provision that the people have a right to clean air and clean water, and, I would argue in a larger sense, the right to the kind of creation here that is connected directly to the question of climate change.  We are talking about God's creation and preserving His creation. If we are trying to preserve God's creation, we better make sure we nominate and confirm people committed to preserving creation itself. We are but stewards of that creation.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate two Medal of Honor recipients who passed away last month. Every Medal of Honor recipient has served his country with extraordinary valor and with little or no regard for his own life and safety.  Air Force Col. Joe Jackson and Army LTC Charles Kettles were no exceptions. They were both pilots and both served honorably in the Vietnam war. Both were responsible for extraordinary rescue missions of American soldiers trapped deep behind enemy lines against incredible odds. These two men were patriots who by chance, skill, and strength of character became true American heroes. They are gone now, but their legacies and examples will always live on. It is up to us to learn from them.  Col. Joe Jackson passed away on January 12 at the age of 95.  Jackson enlisted in the Army Air Corps in 1941, serving as a gunnery instructor for the duration of World War II. But he may never have been a pilot--may never have been a hero--if not for a chance event in that war.  One of his friends, a flight engineer, fell ill right before a B-25 bomber flight. Jackson agreed to take his place. During the flight, one of the engines caught fire. The pilot didn't know what to do, but Jackson did. His timely instructions helped extinguish the fire, possibly saving the aircraft. Emboldened by this incident, Jackson decided to become a pilot--and he did, flying 107 missions as an F-84 Thunderjet pilot during the Korean war and becoming one of the very first pilots of the U-2 spy plane.  That in itself would be a pretty distinguished career of honorable service, but Joe Jackson returned for more, decades later. At the age of 45 he answered the call of service once again, volunteering with the Air Force's 311th Air Commando Squadron to fly cargo planes in Vietnam. It is not often a cargo pilot gets a chance to distinguish himself in combat, but it was in that very role that Joe Jackson earned the Nation's highest honor.  May 12, 1968, was supposed to be a routine cargo mission for Joe Jackson and the crew of his C-123. That all changed when the American special forces camp at Kham Duc was attacked by the North Vietnamese. As the Viet Cong overran the camp and established firing positions just off the landing strip, an emergency evacuation began of the much smaller American contingent.  The evacuation quickly turned into a turkey shoot. Eight aircraft and helicopters were shot down or destroyed on the runway during the desperate evacuation of Kham Duc. In a horrible tragedy, one cargo plane was shot down by North Vietnamese forces shortly after takeoff. All aboard the aircraft perished--the American air crew, plus some 150 South Vietnamese civilians. Eventually, the airlift succeeded in evacuating nearly all of the camp's survivors. But as the last scheduled plane left the runway and the order was given to bomb the remainder of the camp, a horrible discovery was made: Three American soldiers had accidentally been left on the ground. Joe Jackson's plane was the closest to the area, so he made a split-second decision. ``We're going in,'' he said.  The C-123 cargo plane was not known for its agility, but Joe Jackson tested its limits as an aircraft. He banked the plane into a breathtaking turn and descent, dropping 9,000 feet to the runway in a matter of seconds. The plane instantly drew fire from the enemy, including an anti-armor rocket that crashed just shy of the aircraft but, providentially, did not detonate. The three beleaguered soldiers boarded Joe Jackson's aircraft, and he gunned it, lifting them to safety.  That terrible assault on Kham Duc exacted a high toll in American lives. But thanks to Joe Jackson's quick wits and skillful flying, that toll was much lower.  Joe Jackson remained in the Air Force until 1974, when he retired as a full colonel. He taught at the Air Force Air War College so that future pilots could learn from his example. Then he worked for Boeing, helping that great company build airplanes for use in peacetime, not just wartime. He ultimately settled in Kent, WA, with Rosamund, his wife, to whom he was married for 74 years and with whom he had two children.  Joe Jackson was awarded the Medal of Honor by President Lyndon Johnson in January of 1969. He later described the heavy burden that recipients of that honor must shoulder. He said:       I have to represent the thousands of Americans who have      served the country. You have to make them proud of what you      have done and what they have done.  As a former soldier and as an American, let me state that there can be no finer representative of courage under fire than Joe Jackson. May he rest in peace.  LTC Charles Kettles passed away on January 21 at the age of 89.  Kettles was a helicopter pilot with the Army's 176th Assault Helicopter Company, 14th Combat Aviation Battalion, Task Force Oregon.  Flying was in Kettles' blood. He was born in Ypsilanti, MI, to a father who had flown for the Canadian Royal Air Force in World War I and later for the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II.  Kettles was drafted in 1951, which began a whirlwind of Active Duty tours in Korea, Japan, and Thailand. He returned to the armed services in 1963, volunteering as a pilot. That is one thing to note about Charles Kettles. He was always willing to volunteer for dangerous assignments. Vietnam would give him many opportunities to volunteer.  On May 15, 1967, then-Major Kettles volunteered to lead a flight of six Hueys to reinforce the brigade of the 101st Airborne Division that had been ambushed by a battalion of North Vietnamese.  The situation was pretty hairy. It pitted Americans against hundreds of the VC, and the Americans were taking heavy fire. Worse still, they were trapped in little cover in what was called ``Chump Valley,'' so nicknamed because only a chump would go there.  Major Kettles and his team landed under heavy fire from the enemy. One of the aviators later recalled that the tracers were ``like rain . . . coming straight out of the wood line.'' So intense was the enemy fire that several Americans were killed as they approached the evacuation zone. Nevertheless, Major Kettles stayed until reinforcements were offloaded and wounded soldiers were brought on board.  After that insertion, Major Kettles returned to the battlefield a second time when his helicopter was raked front to back by machine-gun fire. Mechanics later counted 40 holes in his Huey. Major Kettles' gunner was seriously wounded in this trip, but Kettles piloted his aircraft, limping back to base streaming fuel.  Those two flights would be a full day's work and then some for any aviator, but Major Kettles wasn't done yet.  Later that day, with the situation in the valley growing yet more desperate, Kettles volunteered for a third time to evacuate the remaining 44 soldiers. So dangerous was the situation that Kettles was ordered to stand down. However, he disobeyed that order.  Kettles led six helicopters on a third landing as fiercely contested by the enemy as the previous two. Soon the last helicopter reported all personnel were evacuated off the ground, and the helicopters evacuated the area. The all clear had been given too soon; a small group of American soldiers who were bravely fighting a rearguard action had been left behind.  One of those soldiers later recalled the feeling when he saw the helicopters disappear over the jungle canopy: ``If it's possible for your heart to fall into your boots, that's what mine did.''  There were now eight Americans stranded in Chump Valley against hundreds of Viet Cong. Those are long odds even for the Screaming Eagles of the 101st.  So for the fourth time that day--the fourth time--in a split-second decision, Kettles turned around his aircraft to land in a hot LZ. This time he returned alone with no gunship support.  When he landed, a mortar exploded near the front of his aircraft, blowing out his Huey's chin bubble, windshields, tail boom, and rotor. His helicopter returned with 40 holes and was 600 pounds overweight because all eight American soldiers were onboard. They all attribute their survival to his brave actions.  Kettles was later awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his extraordinary courage and self-sacrifice, but he wasn't immediately awarded the Medal of Honor. There is one thing Charles Kettles wouldn't volunteer for--the spotlight. He accepted the Distinguished Service Cross and moved on with his life, retiring from the military in 1978 after another tour in Vietnam.  Kettles moved back to Michigan, where he taught aviation management at Eastern Michigan University and worked for Chrysler Pentastar Aviation. He married twice and had nine children, who survive him, along with his wife Ann.  That is how the Kettles' story may have ended if not for a local historian who persuaded Congress and the Army to reopen the file. When they did, it became apparent to all that he deserved the Nation's highest honor. Charles Kettles was awarded the Medal of Honor in 2016 at the young age of 86. Kettles did what he could to downplay his role in saving his comrades in arms. According to him, ``The bottom line of the whole thing is simply that those 44 [soldiers] did get out of there and are not a statistic on that wall in DC. The rest of it is rather immaterial, frankly.''  Pardon me here if I disagree for once with Lieutenant Colonel Kettles. It was due to his bravery that those 44 soldiers returned alive and back to their families. On the battlefield, valor is hardly immaterial; it is essential. Charles Kettles proved that on his four volunteer rescue flights that fateful day.  May he rest in peace. May both of these great warriors rest in peace.  Madam President, I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, I come to the floor this afternoon with mixed emotions--mixed emotions because I feel a tremendous sense of gratitude but also sadness because at the end of this month, tomorrow, after more than a decade of working together, my chief of staff, Maura Keefe, will leave to start a new adventure.  Maura is here on the floor today with my new chief of staff, Chad Kreikemeier, and most of our staff here in DC are in the Gallery watching. Everyone is here because we think so much of Maura, and we are so sad that she is leaving but wish her Godspeed in everything she does. She has been an incredible asset as we worked together to improve the lives of Granite Staters.  I must thank her for her service and share some of the memories from the past 10 years. In New Hampshire, where we are the home of the first primary State, public service and political engagement are part of our culture. It is a culture that is epitomized by Maura and her family.  Maura helped me get elected in 2008. Actually, she helped me before that--in 2002, when I didn't win the election. Despite our loss, she came back and she worked with me in 2008, and then when we won, she set up the office. She had already accumulated several careers by that time in political campaigns and nonprofits and in the private sector. At each and every step along the way, Maura made new friendships, and she blazed a trail of accomplishments. Her time with us has certainly been no different.  I remember right after that election, she and a small group of people were working to set up the office. She showed me the files of people who were interested in working on the staff. I was down here for orientation, and she and the woman who would become the deputy chief of staff spent the whole weekend--while I was running around doing fun things, they were working into the night to go through those resumes to hire the best possible people to open the office.  Maura's father, who served as chief of staff to New Hampshire Senator Tom McIntyre, whose seat I now hold, would be very proud of everything she has done and all of her accomplishments.  I will never be able to thank her enough for building our wonderful team, for hiring a staff of dedicated public servants who work hard for the people of New Hampshire.  Those of us who have had the pleasure to work with Maura know her sense of humor. She does great birthday cards that are very funny. Every month when we do birthdays in the office, she does farewell cards that are sort of testimonials but more roasts--or equally roast and testimonial. Her sense of humanity is also what makes her special. I have certainly benefited from both of these over the last 10 years.  Maura is going to be missed, not just in our offices here in Washington and in New Hampshire but throughout the Senate because for the last several years, she has played an important leadership role among the Democratic chiefs of staff and among the women chiefs of staff. She has made a positive difference for all of our offices, and she has made important and constructive inroads with Senate leadership on both sides of the aisle. Her presence will be missed by so many people in this institution.  Of course she is going to be missed for forging important consensus on the golf course as well. Our office does a golf outing every summer, and Maura is always the one who comes out on top in those golf outings. She has two holes in one, and she displays the plaques for those holes in one on the wall that is between our two offices. They are a reminder that from the Capitol to the tee box and everywhere in between, Maura is a fierce competitor.  Over the last 10 years, there have been real historic moments. I hope those moments will be the cornerstone of Maura's memories from the Senate--the passage of healthcare reform that was decades in the making, ushering in the first bipartisan energy efficiency legislation in a generation, working to put a woman on the twenty-dollar bill, increasing funding and resources to combat the opioid crisis, expanding critical investments for the Office on Violence Against Women, and so many other critical infrastructure projects, changes in New Hampshire that have meant jobs and that have improved the lives of so many of our citizens.  Perhaps the most succinct description of Maura can be credited to Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro, for whom Maura worked as chief of staff in the 1990s. Congresswoman DeLauro once told a reporter aptly that Maura is ``someone who doesn't mince words.'' I can attest to that. When I do things that she thinks are not quite what I ought to be doing, she doesn't mince words; she lets me have it.  I am going to greatly miss her daily doses of wisdom and wit. Her supporting counsel has always been invaluable to me. I can't thank her enough for her dedicated service.  Thank you, Maura. We are all going to miss you but me, most of all.  Thank you, Madam President.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as we are considering the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, I think we should pause a moment to recognize this administration's record on the environment--or should I say the missed opportunities--and what this administration has done in moving America in the wrong direction on environmental protection. This administration's record in dealing with the greatest challenge we have--global climate change--is deplorable.  I had the opportunity to lead a delegation of 10 Members of the Senate to the Paris climate talks in which U.S. leadership demonstrated our ability to get universal consensus that climate change is real, is happening, that it is primarily caused by the activities we do here on Earth, and that we can make a difference in the trajectory of climate change and the impact it will have on our lives. If we follow what science tells us, we can change the course for the better for future generations.  I saw in Paris the importance of U.S. leadership. We had been trying for a long time to get a global agreement to deal with this challenge. It wasn't until America's leadership in Paris that we were able to get a global consensus. In fact, every country in the world signed on to the Paris Agreement and recognized that every nation has the responsibility to respond because what happens in the environment knows no state boundaries--we are all in this together.  Then there was the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. One of his first actions was to withdraw America from the Paris climate agreement. America became the only Nation in the world not to be part of the global effort to deal with climate change.  Our leadership was now going to be lost, but the Trump administration didn't stop there. They have withdrawn the powerplant rules even though it was in 2007 that the Supreme Court, in Massachusetts v. EPA, determined that carbon dioxide is a dangerous air pollutant and is required to be regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency under the clean air rules. Yet the administration is moving in the other direction as it relates to clean air.  They did the same thing with water. The Supreme Court issued certain decisions in regard to regulated waters. It required Congress to act. Congress didn't act. The administration under President Obama issued regulations that were similar to what we had before the Supreme Court decision, and now the Trump administration has withdrawn those regulations as they relate to clean water.  The list goes on. The Trump administration is now backing down on CAFE standards. That is energy efficiencies in our automobiles. Maryland is one of 12 States under section 177 that follow California's tougher standards. That is now being jeopardized by the Trump administration.  As we are considering the leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, we have to recognize that the Trump administration has moved us in the wrong direction. We take pride that with every administration, Congress adds to the protections we have for clean air and clean water and dealing with our environment. Yet we find with this President, the opposite is true. That puts special responsibility on us in Congress. We have to fill that vacuum. Yet the Republican leadership in Congress has made no effort to bring forward legislation to deal with climate change. They have not acknowledged that climate change is real. They have not acknowledged that our activities here are the primary cause of climate change. They have not acknowledged that science tells us that if we do the right thing, we can affect for the better the impact of climate change in our communities. All that has been denied by this administration.  What we should do is bring forward comprehensive legislation to reduce greenhouse gases. We should put a true cost on carbon. Let the market forces help solve the problems we have here. We should provide for the continued efficiency of the transportation sector. We should restore America's leadership. That is what this Congress should be considering. Yet under Republican leadership, we have had no opportunity to consider comprehensive legislation in this area.  If we acted, it would be good for our environment. There is no question about that. Why should we all be concerned about that? Let me give some examples from my State of Maryland. Over the last 50 years, Maryland has experienced a 70-percent increase in rainfall. Tell the people of Ellicott City, who have experienced two 1,000-year floods in the last 20-month period. These are floods that they have never seen before in their lifetime. A large amount of rain that fell in a very short period of time caused tremendous damage to the people of Ellicott City. Tell the 13 million people who are in danger of being displaced by the end of this century because of rising sea levels. Tell the people in the Western United States whose homes were taken by wildfires. We need to act. It would be good for our environment.  I am proud to be one of the Senators who represent the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. There are 18 million people who live in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed. We see a rise in the sea level. This is a vulnerable body of water.  The warming of the Chesapeake Bay is causing the loss of seagrasses that are important for the aquatic life. The salinity of the bay is being diminished because of more freshwater, and that is affecting the ecology of the bay. Algae growths are greater and longer because of the warm waters. All of that affects the Chesapeake Bay. If we respond to climate change, we have a much better chance of improving the quality of the Chesapeake Bay, which is critically important for the way of life for the people who live in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed.  It is also, by the way, an important economic issue. If we do what is right and respond to climate change, we will also be helping our economy. The Chesapeake Bay alone adds $1 trillion to our economy. A clean bay helps our economy. Green energy creates jobs--many more jobs than do traditional fossil fuels.  It also is good for our national security. If we use more of the renewables and fewer fossil, we as a nation will be stronger from the point of view of not being dependent on other countries that don't agree with our way of life for supplying energy needs not only to us but to our allies around the world--to the democratic countries around the world. It makes sense.  As we are considering the future leadership of the Environmental Protection Agency, let us recommit ourselves to recognizing that we have responsibilities to advance these environmental issues and implore upon the Republican leadership to bring forward comprehensive legislation that, in fact, will make a significant difference on the trajectory of climate change here in the United States and will restore America's global leadership on this critically important issue.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I start by associating myself with the remarks of my friend, the senior Senator from the State of Maryland, Mr. Cardin, both with respect to the vital importance of moving forward on climate change legislation here in the Senate and with respect to my opposition to the nomination of Mr. Wheeler. I think we need somebody at the head of the EPA who is going to make the issue of climate change and other vital environmental issues a priority. Mr. President, I come to the floor with respect to another critical issue facing this Senate right now. I would just start by noting the fact that earlier this week, in this very Chamber, the senior Senator from Nebraska, Mrs. Deb Fischer, gave the annual reading of George Washington's Farewell Address, reminding all of us of the advice that our first President gave our country upon his resignation. He encouraged us to review the words of his farewell address frequently as the ``disinterested warnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive to bias his counsel.'' Those were the words of George Washington in his farewell address as he gave us all some warnings and admonitions.  Maryland is particularly proud of the fact that President Washington resigned his military commission in Annapolis, in our Old Senate Chamber. Every year, in the Maryland Senate, where I once served, we honor President Washington for Presidents Day. One year, I had the honor of giving the commemorative address on that occasion, and I appreciate the fact that the U.S. Senate recognizes the extraordinary farewell address delivered by our first President. His words of warning have been prescient throughout history, from his caution against internal divisions, including geographic divisions between the North and the South, to the necessity of avoiding foreign entanglements that would imperil our own unity.  At this particular moment in time, as we reflect on President Washington's Farewell Address, we have to do it in the context of the current President's extraordinary, unnecessary, and, I believe, totally unlawful declaration of emergency powers for the sole purpose of diverting taxpayer money, which has been previously appropriated by this Congress, to a different purpose, especially to build a wall along our southern border. In that context, we really need to reflect on the words of our first President and remember that our Constitution entrusts us, through article I, as a coequal branch of government, to do our duty under the Constitution.  We know the history. We know that after winning our independence from England, President Washington, along with many of our other Founders, was concerned with the possibility of authoritarianism and of the critical need to build checks and balances into our political system. Here is the key warning in the farewell address on this score: ``The habits of thinking in a free country should inspire caution in those entrusted with its administration to confine themselves within their respective constitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one department to encroach upon another.''  President Washington argued that this encroachment of one branch of government on the constitutional powers of another is a natural impulse and one that we must guard against as a self-governing people because of the ``love of power and proneness to abuse it,'' and that is why checks and balances are necessary to prevent it.  He went on to write:       The necessity of reciprocal checks in the exercise of      political power, by dividing and distributing it into      different depositaries and constituting each the guardian of      the public weal against invasions by the others, has been      evinced by experiments ancient and modern, some of them in      our country and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be      as necessary as to institute them.  Now let's review what just happened here in our political system in the last couple of weeks. Just a few weeks ago, President Trump, after failing to achieve his desired outcome through the legislative process, through congressional action, decided that he would bypass the Congress by declaring a national emergency in order to redirect funding to build the wall. This is a textbook example of the kind of power grab by an executive branch that George Washington warned us about in his farewell address.  President Trump is claiming he has this authority pursuant to the National Emergencies Act of 1976, but a review of the legislative history of the National Emergencies Act demonstrates that it was passed not to expand Presidential power but to curb it. Three years earlier, Congress's Special Committee on the Termination of the National Emergency was created to end outdated emergency declarations and, according to the committee's report at the time, ``recommend ways in which the United States can meet future emergency situations with speed and effectiveness but without relinquishment of congressional oversight and control.'' That was what the special committee's report concluded, and that formed the basis of the legislation that followed.  The National Emergencies Act gives the President very, very narrow and conditioned-based authority to declare an emergency and specify the steps necessary to confront it, and it gives Congress the authority, as we saw in the House just yesterday, to pass legislation to disapprove of and to terminate the emergency. Of course, it will also be subject to court review. I would suggest that it is not our job to pass laws which we know to be unconstitutional and simply leave it to the courts to reach the obvious conclusions. We have a responsibility here in this Chamber, not only under the Constitution but under the very statute the President proposes to use now for his declaration, to apply our authority and responsibility as a coequal branch of government.  Now let's review the context of this decision. The President's interest in spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money for a wall along the southern border was not a secret to Congress. Of course, during the campaign--as a matter of his campaign pledges and as he continues to insist--he did say that at the end of the day, Mexico will pay for it. Yet, for the purposes of today, that is not the main point. The point is that the President had told this Congress that it was his intention to try to spend billions of dollars to build a wall.  His original budget request to the Congress for the fiscal year that we are in was $1.6 billion. That was the budget request we got from the Senate Appropriations Committee. Then, last fall and last winter, in December, the President began demanding much higher amounts for the wall he wants to build. In fact, in his meeting with then-Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Leader Schumer on December 11, here is what the President said: If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, through you or the military or anybody else, yes, I will shut down the government.  That was in December. What the President was saying was that if he doesn't get his appropriations--the budget request--through the Congress, he was going to shut down the government. He did, and he did that for 35 days. That was his constitutional prerogative not to sign a bill. It, obviously, caused great harm and dislocation around the country. It caused a lot of economic pain and a lot of personal financial pain to millions of Americans, but the President clearly had the authority to do that.  As the Congress, we were aware of the President's position. He made it very clear. Then, after the government shutdown was over, of course, we passed that short-term piece of legislation to keep the government open for 3 weeks as we worked on a longer term budget plan.  Around February 14 of this year, we passed a compromise budget bill--a compromise appropriations bill. That bill provided $1.375 billion for 55 miles of pedestrian and levee fencing along the U.S. border with Mexico. That bill passed the U.S. Senate by a vote of 83 to 16, and it passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 300 to 128. As with most bills that pass the Congress with those kinds of bipartisan majorities that are compromises, it didn't have everything everyone wanted. It had some things in it that one side or the other may not have wanted, but it was a compromise, and it was made necessary to pass a bill to keep the government open. It was to make sure our constituents received the services of their government and to make sure that we met the needs of the country.  On the very morning that we considered that bill here in the Senate Chamber, President Trump was considering his next steps. In fact, Majority Leader McConnell announced on the floor here that President Trump had told him that he was going to sign the bill but that he was also going to sign an emergency declaration to override the appropriations in the bill and divert those moneys to some other purpose that Congress had not authorized. In fact, while Senator McConnell was making that statement at the time we were considering and voting on the bill, it was not a surprise that the President had been considering it. He had been talking for weeks and threatening the Congress that if he didn't get the appropriations levels he wanted for the wall--if he didn't get the budget allocation he wanted--he was just going to declare a national emergency and do it himself. That was his threat.  Clearly, he hoped that threat would force Congress to provide the extra moneys the President requested for the wall, but the Congress didn't do the President's bidding. We passed that compromise bill by those large bipartisan majorities. So what did the President do? Of course, he declared this emergency.  I should note that even as he announced his emergency declaration in the Rose Garden, the President said: ``I could do the wall over a longer period of time. I didn't need to do this . . . but I'd rather do it much faster.'' That is what the President said at the time. He said he didn't need to do this, not in that way, but he wanted to do this quickly.  Here is the thing. He didn't need to do it. He made it very clear that he decided to do it simply because he didn't get what he wanted from the U.S. Congress; that because we didn't do what the President--what the Executive asked, heck, he was going to declare some emergency to divert money from areas the Congress had approved on a bipartisan basis to some other area the President wanted to spend money on, in this case the wall.  Now, look, the Constitution is pretty clear. The President had the power to veto that bill. He, of course, had refused to go along with an earlier proposal, and that led to a 3-week government shutdown. The President could have done that again. That would have been in his power to do it, and of course the choice for the Congress at that point would have been whether to override the President's veto.  If you look at the size of the votes that appropriations bill passed by--83 to 16 in the U.S. Senate and 300 to 128 in the House--he could have overridden the veto. That would have been the constitutional way for the President of the United States to try to get his way, but that is not what he did. He decided to do something different, declare an emergency in an unconstitutional way.  The question we have to ask ourselves--and I am talking Republicans and Democrats, and I am talking about the Senate as an institution, the House of Representatives as an institution--is should this President or any other President--or any other President--be able to override an appropriations law to the tune of billions of dollars right after Congress has already expressed its position in a bill that we passed by overwhelming majorities or by any majority, a bill that passed.  In declaring this alleged emergency, the President has announced his intention to divert $2.6 billion from the Department of Defense counterdrug activities. This is an ironic diversion, considering the President's stated concern, which I share, about drug trafficking.  The Defense Department has indicated that those moneys the President is proposing to take from drug trafficking are being spent for that purpose and that only about $85 million remains in that account. So that means they are going to have to take other moneys from other Defense Department priorities, and the President has indicated they want to take $3.6 billion from military construction accounts--moneys that this Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has already appropriated for those military construction projects.  Article I is crystal clear. Article I of the Constitution vests this Congress-- this Senate and the House of Representatives--with the power of the purse.  I have my handy, small Constitution right here, and I would just again like to remind our colleagues that it says: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law, and a regular statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all public money shall be published from time to time.''  So article I of the Constitution is very clear. It is the U.S. Congress that has the power of the purse and has the authority to direct taxpayer moneys to the priorities that we decide.  I ask my colleagues whether they are prepared to relinquish that authority. In fact, I would make the point it is really not ours to relinquish because the Constitution is quite clear on this point.  We all know that yesterday the House of Representatives took a vote to say the President is not able to use the particular law he used the other day to declare an emergency. This Senate is going to be voting on that soon, and we have to ask ourselves as Senators what kind of precedent we want to set.  Do we want to adhere to our duties under the Constitution? Should any President be able to say, ``Oh, my goodness. I don't like what the Congress just did. I don't like the fact that the Congress, through their duly elected Representatives and duly elected Senators, didn't give me all the money I wanted for the wall, and so I am going to throw the Constitution out, and I am going to take money that the Congress proposed for one purpose, and I am just going to move it somewhere else''?  I want my colleagues to think really carefully about the precedent we would be establishing if we allow that action to go unchecked.  We were just having a conversation here on the floor, my colleague from the State of Maryland and others, about the dangers and risks of climate change. That is a real crisis. I believe we should be investing a lot more funds in building out our clean energy infrastructure.  We may well have a future President, maybe sooner rather than later, who wants to do that. I just ask my colleagues whether they think that President should be able to declare a national emergency and spend money for that purpose even if this Congress has not appropriated the moneys for that purpose.  The idea that the President of the United States--any President of the United States--is going to declare an emergency simply because he or she did not get the appropriations request they asked for is unprecedented. We have looked. There have been times when people have declared emergencies, but we were not able to find any time where we have a situation like this, where a President, who tried to get a certain appropriation for a certain purpose out of Congress, didn't get it and immediately turned around and asked for a national emergency to do what the Congress had just denied them the authority to do.  Just this morning President Trump's adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was on ``FOX & Friends'' and said the President had to act because Congress didn't. In other words, the President had to act because Congress, on a bipartisan basis, through its duly elected representatives, did not give the President of the United States, the Executive, what the Executive asked for. That is why the President gets to declare an emergency.  That would create a lawless situation and a gross violation of our Constitution.  She went on to say: ``It's failed to do its job since he has been President on securing the border, and it has failed to do its job for decades, and so he waited for them.'' In other words, because the President is dissatisfied with what the Congress did, he gets to tear up the Constitution and go his own way.  Back in 1983, when President Reagan was frustrated with the Congress and its control of the budget, he received a letter urging him to declare a state of emergency over our Nation's finances. In response, President Reagan acknowledged his frustration but wrote: ``I don't believe the President has the power to declare an emergency short of war.''  I urge my colleagues--I urge my colleagues--to be cautious in allowing any President to use or claim an emergency in order to undercut the clear division of power set forth in the Constitution between the legislative and the executive branch.  Yesterday Leader McConnell was asked about the legality of President Trump's move, and the majority leader acknowledged he ``hadn't reached a total conclusion'' on whether President Trump is acting legally.  Think about that. You have the majority leader acknowledging that the President may be acting unlawfully. I think it is pretty clear on its face for those who closely examine the Constitution and the power of the purse.  I think we are all called upon not as Republicans or Democrats but as Americans and as Senators in this Chamber to do our job and reject what is clearly an unconstitutional power grab. We should not passively submit to these actions. We should think about what we are going to do in light of the precedent that is being set here, and I hope we will do our jobs.  I will just close with another statement from President Washington's Farewell Address where he cautioned against allowing any one branch of government to claim excessive power, even with the best of motivations. ``Let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, in one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary weapon by which free governments are destroyed.''  In my view, the President's actions are not for the good, but I know many of my Republican colleagues would agree with the ends the President seeks with respect to using more moneys to build a wall. I understand that is the position of our Republican colleagues, but what George Washington warned us about was--whether we like what the President is doing or don't like what the President is doing--if the President is diverting money away from the purposes this Senate and the House of Representatives directed to some other purpose this President or any other President may want that we have not authorized, that is a gross usurpation of power, and we should not allow it to happen.  So I ask my colleagues, let's join together to do the business of the Senate, protect the Constitution, and do our jobs.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I would associate myself with the comments of Senator Van Hollen, who I think hit the nail on the head when it comes to this overreach by the President.  I rise in support of the growing calls for action on climate change that are echoing in every corner of this Nation.  The science is overwhelming, the evidence is clear, and unless we take immediate action, we will lose our planet as we know it. There is nowhere that has more at stake than my home State of New Mexico and the Southwest, which are in the bullseye of global warming. Unless we act against greenhouse gas pollution, rising temperatures, drought, wildfires, deforestation, we will permanently harm our communities.  Because I believe in climate science and because I believe we desperately need to act, I must strongly oppose the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler to lead our Nation's Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Wheeler has consistently advocated for measures that would damage the environment, hurt public health, and do long-term injury to the economy, and his record on climate change and the record of his administration are simply disqualifying.  Mr. Wheeler's nomination is among the worst in a long line of backward nominations by this President. For someone who wants to lead the EPA--the key word being ``protection''--Mr. Wheeler's priorities are upside down.  Let's be blunt with the American people. Mr. Wheeler was not nominated to protect the environment and human health. He was nominated to unravel and undo the environmental protections that are now in place. He was nominated to stop any new environmental and public health protections from being initiated. He was nominated to go easy on those who violate existing environmental laws. He was nominated to stand in the way of climate science and climate action. So far, by these measures, he has been a great success for a President who mocks climate science and who denies that this existential threat even exists, but there is no success for the American people. Mr. Wheeler's nomination puts the American public at great risk, and we should firmly oppose making his appointment permanent.  Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler's upside-down priorities don't end at climate change. In addition to actively resisting climate action, Mr. Wheeler is not looking out for the health and well-being of my constituents or protecting my State's most precious resource, our water. There, like in so many other parts of the country, fire foam used by the Air Force has contaminated groundwater with toxic chemicals known as PFAS. These chemicals are linked to various cancers, heart disease, and other ailments. Groundwater in and around Cannon Air Force Base, near Clovis, NM, is contaminated with PFAS.  This is dairy country. One dairy is actually being put out of business because the PFAS is in groundwater and it has contaminated this farmer's water wells. The family that owns the dairy and its hard-working employees have drank water from these wells for years.  Will a Wheeler EPA put us in this situation? Will they help us out of it? During his confirmation hearings, he refused to commit to setting a drinking water standard. Then, later, we find out that he had already decided not to set standards for these toxic chemicals in December of last year. Under bipartisan pressure, he has since backed down and says EPA will set a standard--someday. I wouldn't hold my breath. In the meantime, millions of Americans and the dairies in eastern New Mexico are being hurt.  Furthermore, Mr. Wheeler is a committed soldier in the long-running assault on science that President Trump has championed. One of my constituents, Celerah Hewes, wrote this week asking me to vote against this nomination. She writes:       I grew up in Corrales, surrounded by farmland and fresh      air. I remember when the Rio Grande was full of water and the      ditches in the bosque flowed freely.       Climate change and drought have forever changed the land I      call home and my daughter will not remember a time without      severe fire danger and ozone pollution.  Celerah wants me to vote no because Mr. Wheeler ``is putting our children's health and future at risk.''  According to the 2018 ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' we have 12 years to turn this around for Celerah, her daughter, and the world. Soon, the impacts will become irreversible.  The previous EPA set rules to reduce carbon pollution from powerplants by 32 percent by 2030. Mr. Wheeler's new plan will allow increased emissions from fossil fuel plants instead.  He is no better when it comes to even modest standards for methane waste from oil and gas operations. Methane is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide over the initial 20-year period. EPA's prior methane rules would have cut back methane pollution in a cost-effective way. Those regulations are out the window under Mr. Wheeler and replaced with loose rules, adding hundreds of thousands of tons of methane, volatile organic compounds, and toxins into the air.  Climate change is the most significant threat facing our planet. The EPA is the Agency that should be leading the charge on tackling this threat, but Mr. Wheeler is a former lobbyist for the coal industry. Like so many other nominations, the President has again put the fox in charge of the henhouse. This time, the consequences could be disastrous and irreversible for our country and our planet. If we vote to confirm him, there will be little, if any, hope for climate action for the next 2 years.  Mr. Wheeler leaves no doubt whose side he is on. His record shows that, under his watch, big polluters will get off scot-free.  Companies that pollute often try to reduce their cost of business and increase their profits by dumping that pollution and its costs on society as a whole. When environmental officials fail to enforce the rules against polluters, bad actors get an unfair advantage. Lax environmental enforcement is bad for American businesses that do the right thing and bad for taxpayers, who get stuck with the cleanup bills.  Sadly, Mr. Wheeler's EPA is the poster child for lax enforcement. In 2018, EPA collected the smallest amount of civil penalties against polluters since 1994. Inspections are half of what they were in 2010. EPA charged the fewest criminal defendants since 1991. It saw a steep drop in civil judicial enforcement cases as well. The bad news goes on and on.  So the best that can be said of Mr. Wheeler's record is that he is not Scott Pruitt. As far as we know, he has not abused taxpayer funds or staff for a variety of luxurious perks or rented his house from a lobbyist. But the bar is so low that it is in the Capitol basement.  Indeed, I believe that the EPA under this President has reached an all-time low. There is hardly even any pretense that their goal is to safeguard the environment and public health. They are actively damaging our environment and actively resisting action on climate change at a time when young people and so many others across New Mexico and this country are crying out for action. We simply must do better.  So I will vote no, and I will urge my colleagues to consider the consequences of this nomination for their children, grandchildren, and beyond, and to vote no as well.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a great loss suffered in my home State of Georgia and more specifically in the city of Valdosta. For more than 40 years, Parker Greene spent every day of his life thinking about how he could make a difference in his community by supporting the various missions at Moody Air Force Base, which is located just on the outskirts of Valdosta in South Georgia. Parker passed away on December 18, 2018, at the age of 86. He leaves behind a lasting legacy that will be remembered throughout my home State for decades to come.  Parker moved to Valdosta in 1970 and immediately became involved with the Valdosta-Lowndes County Chamber of Commerce. He was named to the military affairs committee and quickly developed a fondness for the airmen stationed at Moody, as well as the multiple missions housed at the base. Through the years, his level of advocacy for Moody continued to increase. The local community recognized this and created the Moody Support Committee and named Parker as its chairman. As chairman, Parker took countless trips every year to Washington, DC, to impress upon congressional and Department of Defense leaders the importance of maintaining a robust Air Force presence at Moody due to its strategic location in the southeastern U.S. and unmatched community support.  In the 1990s, when the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended closing Moody and moving its missions to other bases, Parker and the Moody Support Committee tirelessly walked the halls of Congress and the Pentagon to advocate for the removal of Moody from the BRAC list and to increase its mission presence. Parker's efforts proved successful. His determination allowed Moody to continue its mission, while sparing the Valdosta community from certain economic loss due to the closure of the base.  Following his successful efforts in the 1990s, Parker continued his work on Moody's behalf to relocate new missions to the base in order to diversify Moody's mission presence and further prove its strategic importance. In fact, in 2007, the newly constructed consolidated base support center at Moody was named after Parker because of his efforts on behalf of the base and its airmen. Former Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Moseley was at the renaming and presented Parker with the first-ever Chief of Staff Exceptional Service Award.  Several years later, Parker was awarded the highest honor the Air Force can bestow on a civilian: the Air Force Distinguished Public Service Award. The award stated that Parker ``distinguished himself by service as an Air Force advocate, with both an intimate knowledge of Air Force operations and a deep grasp of social and economic issues vital to Moody Air Force Base. He has expertly advised the Secretary of the Air Force, the Chief of Staff, and senior Air Force leaders on these matters while serving as an Air Force civic leader to the community surrounding the installation.''  Of course, Parker could not have accomplished his many feats without the loyal and steadfast support from his lovely wife Dr. Lucy Greene. Together, they made an unstoppable duo, and Lucy proved to be as tireless an advocate for Moody as Parker. I know I speak for the entire State when I offer my heartfelt condolences to Lucy and their two children, Buck and Sharon.  While we mourn Parker and the loss to Moody AFB and south Georgia, I know that everyone can look at Parker's record of achievement and see an unparalleled legacy of selflessness, kindness, and service to others. I have no doubt that Moody will continue to be a leading example of Air Force excellence because of Parker's impact on the base and his advocacy for the region in Atlanta and Washington."

According to the National Center for State Courts, an estimated 1.3 million adults are under the care of guardians--family members or professionals--who control approximately $50 billion of their assets. Guardianship is a legal relationship created by a court that is designed to protect those with diminished or lost capacity. We found, however, that in some cases, the system lacks basic protections against inappropriate use of guardianship and abuse by those in power, leaving the most vulnerable Americans at risk of exploitation.  In November 2018, the Aging Committee released a bipartisan report following a year-long investigation into State guardianship programs. Titled, ``Ensuring Trust: Strengthening State Efforts to Overhaul the Guardianship Process and Protect Older Americans,'' the report included a number of recommendations intended to help stem the wave of guardianship abuse, encourage reforms to State systems and restore trust in guardianship arrangements.  Throughout the course of our investigation, we heard harrowing tales from families around the Nation who have struggled with abusive guardians, unscrupulous individuals exploiting vulnerable Americans for their personal profit. Yet we also spoke with families who had heartening stories to share--of dedicated and faithful guardians stepping up to protect the assets of seniors with dementia and other conditions affecting their capacity. A good guardian can provide years of support for a protected individual, ensuring a full life directed, wherever possible, by the person's own choices and preferences. Once a guardianship is imposed, however, the individual's rights are removed, and oversight to protect the individual from abuse, neglect and exploitation becomes critical.  Our Committee gathered information, analysis and recommendations from States, courts, and organizations representing older Americans and those with disabilities around the country. We found signs of progress in a number of jurisdictions. For example, in 2017, Maine was the first state to enact the Uniform Law Commission's Uniform Guardianship, Conservatorship, and Other Protective Arrangements Act. Among the reforms made to Maine's guardianship system, this legislation highlighted the importance of exploring all options to limit or preclude the need for guardianship when appropriate, including the use of supported decision making. Maine's law also mandates the regular review of reports filed by guardians to determine, among other things, whether the guardianship should continue and whether the guardian has complied with his or her duties.  Yet stories in the news continue to call our attention to this important issue. Appalling stories, such as that of a guardian from Nevada who allegedly used the guardianship process to financially exploit more than 150 individuals, and that of another guardian from North Carolina who, along with an attorney, an advocate, and a professor, took advantage of two men under guardianship and allegedly stole hundreds of thousands of dollars, remind us of the vulnerabilities created by these relationships and the need for diligent oversight.  In the course of the Committee's investigation, we received more than 100 comments identifying gaps in the system and, most important, offering solutions. The Committee found a pattern of barriers to proper oversight and a need for greater use of alternatives to guardianship. We found persistent and widespread challenges that require a nationwide focus in order to ensure the guardianship system works on behalf of the individuals it is intended to protect. The Committee's report outlines policy recommendations at local, state and federal levels that would improve outcomes for Americans subject to guardianship.  The Guardianship Accountability Act, which we are introducing today, addresses many of the report's recommendations. The bill would direct the Elder Justice Coordinating Council to establish a National Online Resource Center on Guardianship to collect and publish information relevant to guardianship for use by guardians, individuals subject to guardianship, as well as courts, states, local governments, and community organizations. The resource center would also publish model legislation and best practices developed pursuant to the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, compile and publish training materials for guardians, share research related to guardianship, and maintain a database on state laws regarding guardianship and the use of less restrictive alternatives. In addition, our legislation would also expand the availability of federal demonstration grants established by the Elder Justice Act, so funds can be used for developing state guardianship databases, for training for court visitors, and for sharing information on guardian background checks.  Combating financial abuse and exploitation of seniors requires law enforcement and social service agencies at all levels of government to work together, and the bipartisan Guardianship Accountability Act promotes this kind of collaboration. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I am here today to talk about climate change and about our climate crisis.  Climate change is an existential threat to our country and the planet. We know this because the world's leading scientists--the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--just made that very warning last year. The U.N. report told us that we have very limited time until we are past the point of no return and the most catastrophic impacts of climate change are irreversible. Our own Federal scientists across 13 Agencies also just warned in the ``National Climate Assessment'' that the impacts of climate change are not in the future but are happening in our communities right now. Here is what all 13 Federal Agencies said: ``Our efforts do not yet approach the scale necessary to avoid substantial damages to the economy, environment, and human health.''  These are Earth-shattering reports about the state of our Earth. These are the doomsday reports about what will happen if we do not take bold action.  The consequences of climate change will be dire: a tenfold increase in ice-free summers in the Arctic, a 99-percent loss of coral reefs, and a doubling of species lost around the world. In worst-case scenarios in the Northeast, by the end of the century, both the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Logan Airport will be underwater. Climate emissions are not slowing down. In 2018, greenhouse gas emissions in the United States increased by 2.8 percent. We have a denier-in-chief in the White House.  This week, Republicans in the Senate are poised to confirm a coal lobbyist to be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is unbelievable that we will confirm a coal lobbyist to be the head of our environment in our country. Andrew Wheeler's denial of the climate crisis should in and of itself be disqualifying. His record as a coal lobbyist should be disqualifying.  We should come together and reject Andrew Wheeler as the next head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The impact of climate change on ordinary families, on their health, on our Nation, on our security, and on our future is too urgent.  The United Nations tells us that climate change is an existential threat to the planet. It is the national security, health, economic, and moral issue of our time--of all time. We have a responsibility to act. We must be bold. We must be ambitious. That is why I have introduced the Green New Deal resolution, because it lays out a serious, bold, and aspirational set of goals that meet the scale of the threat. It is a set of principles and not prescriptions. It challenges this country to find solutions to this problem.  The Green New Deal is a climate plan about net-zero emissions. The Republican climate plan is in zero existence. They don't have a climate plan. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because they don't like a functional government. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because they don't like climate science. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because their allies--the oil companies, the coal companies, and the corporate polluters--don't like wind power or solar power or all-electric vehicles or the millions of blue-collar jobs they can create. We can save all of creation by engaging in massive blue-collar job creation in this country. Republicans don't like the Green New Deal because clean energy is a direct threat to the interests and the bottom line of Big Oil and King Coal.  The Green New Deal isn't just a socialist manifesto. It isn't pie in the sky. It isn't a takeover. It isn't any of the misinformation and distortions that Republicans and their fossil fuel allies have called it. The Green New Deal isn't, as the Republican leader called it this morning, ``the far left's Santa Claus wish list dressed up to look like serious policy.'' If it were, then Republicans in this Chamber wouldn't care enough about it to spend their entire morning remarks on it, and the majority leader wouldn't be threatening to bring it to the floor without any hearings, without any expert testimony, without any amendments, and without any science.  Let's have the debate. Let's have the hearings. Let's bring in all the experts. Let's let the U.N. testify. Let's let our own scientists and every one of the Federal Agencies in America testify. Let's bring in all of the corporate executives right now on wind, solar, all-electric vehicles, and storage batteries in our society. Bring them in. Let's hear the stories. Instead, what we have is just an attempt to short-circuit the debate.  They may not believe climate change is an existential threat to human kind, but they are smart enough to know that the bold goals of the Green New Deal are an existential threat to the Koch brothers and all of their other corporate polluter and fossil fuel allies.  Let me just read some of what is in the Green New Deal that Republicans are opposed to: securing for all people of the United States for generations to come clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment.  Are Republicans opposed to access to nature? That is in the resolution. Are Republicans opposed to clean air and water? That is in the resolution too. Do you know what is not in the resolution? Ending airline travel. Do you know what is not in the resolution? No more cows.  Do you know what is not in the resolution? A prohibition on nuclear energy or carbon capture and sequestration. The Green New Deal resolution is bold, and it is aspirational in its principles, but it is not prescriptive in its policies.  Let's look at some of what is actually in this resolution: to create millions of good, high-wage jobs--I guess Republicans don't believe in that; to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenge of the 21st century--I guess Republicans don't believe in that; guaranteeing universal access to clean water, supporting family farming, cleaning up existing hazardous waste and abandoned sites, ensuring economic development and sustainability on those sites--I guess Republicans don't believe in those either. Those are all part of the Green New Deal and climate solutions.  We already know that Big Oil and King Coal and other fossil fuel companies don't want to compete with clean energy because that is a direct threat to their business plan.  Clean energy makes the air we breathe cleaner, it saves consumers money, it makes us safer, and it creates jobs.  In his remarks, the Republican leader called the Green New Deal ``foolish and dangerous.'' With all due respect to the leader and my Republican colleagues, the only foolish and dangerous thing about the Green New Deal is to ignore the $400 billion in damage to our country over the last 2 years from supercharged storms and wildfires all over California and all over the West.  To ignore the tens of trillions of dollars in damages we will see from climate change in the United States by 2100 is something that ultimately, from my perspective, is foolish and dangerous. An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure. Ignoring what is happening, ignoring the warnings from all of the top scientists in the world and in the United States and continuing on the same pathway--that is foolish, that is dangerous, and that is going to cost us tens of trillions of dollars in damages that would have been otherwise avoided if we unleashed a technology revolution in our country that would create millions of new jobs.  It is also dangerous to send our men and women in the military overseas to protect tankers of oil coming from the Middle East to the United States. We are still bringing in oil from Saudi Arabia. We are still bringing in oil from other countries in the Middle East. What if we could dramatically increase the fuel economy in the vehicles we drive? What if we could accelerate the pace to use all-electric vehicles? Wouldn't it be great if we could say that the day arrived when we never have to see another tanker of oil from the Middle East coming into our country? Would that not make us safer? Would that not give us better control of our own foreign policy and where we send young men and women in uniform? I think it would.  I think it would be foolish and dangerous not to take that pathway. The superstorms, the wildfires, the rising seas, and the other extreme weather events--the impacts of climate change if we do not act boldly to stop it--that isn't just dangerous; that is an existential threat. That is what the world's scientists have called it.  The Green New Deal is dangerous for the status quo of doing nothing on climate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who are used to killing off every climate debate before it gets a chance to start. It is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening future with no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for those who benefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, the historic oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued destruction of the environment. Those are the ones who would think the Green New Deal is dangerous.  We want to support working families and support a safe climate future where all communities are protected. We welcome a debate on proposals for how to get there, but the science is clear as to where we need to end up.  The Republicans may think that the Green New Deal is just a resolution, but it is a revolution. It is a revolution. Young people want a green energy revolution in our country. They know we can do this. They know that all of these new technologies can be invented; all of these new technologies can be deployed.  It is not just a resolution; it is a revolution. All across this country, when the Republicans have refused to bring their climate plan out there because theirs is a party of science denial--the President is the ``Denier in Chief'' on climate science--then we are going to allow this problem to worsen and worsen and worsen.  Do you know who should know best? Donald Trump, because within 30 years, according to the science, Mar-a-Lago is going to become Mar-a-Lagoon. It is right on the coast. It has already begun to happen. It is just going to continue.  The President might be able to protect his property, but we are going to lose tens of trillions of dollars for the properties of other Americans because he decided that he was going to deny the warning that the scientists have presented to us.  When I was a boy, lying on the rug, looking at President Kennedy on the television, he challenged our country to send a mission to the Moon and to return that mission safely to the United States within 10 years.  When he gave that speech at Rice University, he made very clear in the speech that we would have to invent new metal alloys that did not exist. We would have to invent new transmission systems that did not exist, that we would have to return that mission safely from the Moon through heat half the intensity of the Sun. We would have to complete it within 10 years, and we would have to do it not because it was easy but because it was hard. We had to be bold.  Because the challenge from the Soviet Union was so great, the United States did not have an option. Failure was not an option, and we completed that mission.  Well, the same thing is true here for a Green New Deal. Failure is not an option. The consequences will be catastrophic for our planet and for the United States of America, and the solution is to unleash this green energy job-creation engine. We now have 350,000 solar and wind workers in the United States. It is up from almost nothing in 2008. It has already happened over 10 years.  We had only 1,000 megawatts of solar in our country in 2008. We now have 62,000 megawatts of solar.  We had only 25,000 megawatts of wind. We now have 98,000 megawatts of wind.  We had only 2,000 all-electric vehicles in our country in 2008. We now have a million, and between Tesla and all of the other companies, they are going to sell 500,000 just this year in our country. They have invented new metals. They have invented new battery systems. They have invented new propulsion systems in order to solve those problems, but we still have a long way to go.  It is imperative that we put the tax breaks for wind and solar, for all electric vehicles, for batteries on the books and make them permanent because this problem is going to be solved only if we can convince the smartest young people in our country that all of the incentives, all of the policies are there and that their country has their back and wants them to solve the problem in the same way that our whole country had the back of NASA in the 1960s. If we do that, we will be successful. There is no question about it in my mind.  I am a technological optimist, and I hate the pessimism of the other side. I hate this ``can't do'' mentality that they have, especially given what has happened in the last 10 years in electric vehicles and wind, solar, and storage technology breakthroughs. It is just really sad to hear this.  I think, ultimately, something is rising up across this country. Young people, especially, know it is time for the revolution. They know it is time to close the door on this era where all we do is indiscriminately use the atmosphere as a sewer for all of this carbon and all of these greenhouse gases.  I am very confident that one way or another this body will start to act or it is going to become one of the top two or three election issues in 2020 because this generation knows that the planet is running a fever. There are no emergency rooms on planets, and it is going to take action in this body in order to put the policies in place, in order to preserve this planet and hand it on better than we found it.  The challenge is great. The Green New Deal sets the framework for laying out how serious the problem is and how bold the action has to be to deal with that serious problem for our planet.  If we do it right, I think future generations will look back on ours in the same way we now look back on President Kennedy and that generation, and they will know that they discharged their historic responsibility to our country and to the planet.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in many ways, Andrew Wheeler is a perfect example of a Cabinet appointment in the Trump era--conflicted, unethical, and hostile to the mission of the Agency he was nominated to lead.  He shouldn't have been confirmed to this position as Deputy Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the EPA, and he certainly shouldn't be confirmed to lead the Agency on a permanent basis.  Prior to his service at EPA, Mr. Wheeler spent 8 years lobbying for many of the special interests that he is targeted or charged with regulating. For example, in his work for Murray Energy, whose president, Robert Murray, was among the largest donors to Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, Mr. Wheeler worked to kill a rule that would have prevented coal companies from dumping mining waste into American streams and waterways.  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Mr. Wheeler also fought tooth and nail against President Obama's Clean Power Plan, a forward-looking initiative that would have substantially reduced carbon emissions from power generation.  Mr. Wheeler's client, Robert Murray, was present front and center as former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt signed an Executive order to begin the process of dismantling the Clean Power Plan. I don't think that was a coincidence.  After Mr. Wheeler's confirmation as the EPA's Deputy Administrator, he assured Bloomberg News in June 2018: ``If I lobbied on something, I don't think it's appropriate for me to participate [in policymaking].''  Of course, he was lobbying on a lot of things for years. In fact, Mr. Wheeler participated in meetings with three former clients with interests before the EPA. Holding these meetings with former clients is a clear conflict of interest and ethical lapse. Andrew Wheeler fits right in with Donald Trump's version of ``draining the swamp,'' which is more like ``come on in, the water's fine.''  We have already had one EPA Administrator, Scott Pruitt, resign in disgrace over ethical lapses and potentially illegal behavior in office. We don't need another.  Mr. Wheeler's work at the EPA is also consistent with the hostility of Trump Cabinet officials to the core mission of the Department or the Agency that they are appointed to lead.  The EPA is the primary Agency charged with safeguarding the environment and protecting public health from dangerous and toxic chemicals. At its core, the EPA is tasked with making sure we have safe air to breathe and clean water to drink.  Yet, during his time as Deputy Administrator, Mr. Wheeler has championed a deregulatory agenda that fundamentally undermines the EPA's core mission. Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has proposed undermining the legal authority of the mercury and air toxics standard to reduce emissions of mercury and other toxic air emissions from coal and oil burning powerplants.  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, mercury exposure can damage the nervous, digestive, and immune systems and is a serious threat to child development. The EPA's current efforts to reverse these emission standards, in place since 2012, come after utilities across the country had already invested resources in reducing mercury emissions by 90 percent.  Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, the Trump administration has also proposed a dramatic weakening of fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars. Their proposed rule would increase air pollution from vehicles and would result in Hawaii families ending up paying thousands more dollars for gasoline to fill less efficient cars. Through his opposition to the Clean Power Plan and his efforts to repeal it at the EPA, Mr. Wheeler serves as a primary architect of the Trump administration's assault on climate science and their refusal to act decisively against climate change. This assault can also be seen in a new proposed rule from the EPA that would exclude rigorous, peer-reviewed scientific studies under the guise of promoting scientific transparency.  At first glance, the rule sounds like something everyone should support, but like so many initiatives proposed by this administration, the rule's true intent is much more sinister.  Insisting that policymaking rely only on studies that make all of their data public would exclude studies that rely on confidential medical information that by law cannot be made public. Limiting the factual basis on which the EPA can make decisions in this manner would have a catastrophic impact on public health.  If this rule had been in effect in 1993, the ``Six Cities'' study by the Harvard School of Public Health would never have transformed the way we regulate air pollution in this country. The study showed that Americans living in cities with more air pollution have shorter lifespans than Americans living in cities with less air pollution.  Using confidential medical information, the study conclusively demonstrated that fine particulate matter that is smaller than 2.5 microns is exceptionally deadly to human beings. These findings, which have been backed up in subsequent studies, provide the basis for cost-benefit analyses done by EPA for future rules regulating air pollution. Undermining this kind of evidence-based policymaking would give industry the green light to pollute with fewer consequences.  This proposed rule is consistent with an administration-wide effort to promote ignorance in the face of the real threat climate change poses to national security, public health, and public safety.  Climate change is an issue where ignorance is not bliss. Ignorance is dangerous. The President's own top security officials agree. Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, for example, issued a new worldwide threat that concluded that ``climate hazards'' like extreme weather, wildfires, droughts, and acidifying oceans are, ``threatening infrastructure, health and water and food security.''  In 2017, then-Secretary of Defense James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services Committee that ``climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world where our troops are operating.'' He went on to say that ``climate change is a challenge that requires a broader whole-of-government government response.''  Instead of accepting the conclusions of his top national security officials, Donald Trump is following the recommendation of William Happer, a notorious climate denier and now a Senior Director on the NSC, to establish a new Presidential Committee on Climate Security.  Dr. Happer is particularly notorious for his assertion that ``the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the poor Jews under Hitler. Carbon dioxide is actually a benefit to the world, and so are the Jews.  Anyone who makes this kind of outrageous analogy should not be entrusted to lead anything on climate security, in my view.  No one should doubt that the President and Dr. Happer have a preordained outcome in mind. They want to legitimize ignorance and denial of climate change and abandon tens of millions of Americans to the disastrous impacts of climate change in the coming decades.  I repeat, with climate change, ignorance is not bliss. It is dangerous. It is dangerous for a State like Hawaii that would be the hardest hit by the impact of climate change. With extreme weather, ocean acidification, coral bleaching, and rising seas, climate change poses an existential threat to our State. It is one of the reasons Hawaii has implemented some of the most ambitious and aggressive policies to combat climate change in the country.  Hawaii was the first State to separately ratify the Paris climate agreement and has set an ambitious goal of becoming carbon neutral and generating 100 percent of our power from renewable sources by 2045. Hawaii's ambitious effort to confront climate change and the success we have already seen in moving toward our goals demonstrate that we can embrace similarly ambitious policies at the national level.  It is one of the reasons I have signed on as a cosponsor of the Green New Deal--an aspirational effort to transform our economy to combat climate change.  In the weeks since the plan was introduced, we have endured all kinds of mocking outrage from people who would rather stick their heads in the sand as science and fact deniers. They paint the Green New Deal as something scary and dangerous for the country. What is really scary and dangerous are people like them who deny that climate change is real and refuse to do anything about it in their steadfast support and alliance with the fossil fuel industry. History will not be kind to them.  Rejecting the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, we can take one step forward in the fight against dangerous ignorance.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau once said: ``What use is a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?''  We might just expand that question to say what use is anything if we destroy our planet because it is the only one we have. There is no planet B, no rescuing by going to some horrific other planet nearby. We have the gem, we have the treasure, and we have the responsibility to make sure we don't destroy it.  Here we are. Within a single human lifetime, we have increased the percent of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere by a dramatic amount--about 30 percent in my lifetime and more if you are older--and that chemistry change is really unseen in geological history on this planet, such a rapid change with rapid, deep growth.  That is why we are coming to the floor to keep talking about this issue, reach across the aisle, reach across the country, and find partners to say this isn't a blue or red issue. This isn't a city or rural issue. It affects us all, and we need to all work together to respond. As we do so, we need America to lead the world in responding.  Senator Carper's resolution says a couple simple things. It says we recognize that we have a very warming climate on Earth. It says we recognize that human activity burning fossil fuel has consequences, and it calls on us to act. There we are. It is time to confront this enormous threat to our beautiful blue-green home in the middle of the cosmos.  There are some who say: That is so scary, so intimidating, so threatening. I just can't open my eyes or ears to hear that information. I have to pretend it is not real.  We are here in the Senate. We are here where we don't have the privilege of covering our eyes, our ears, pretending it is not happening. We have the responsibility to face this when others shy away and act.  There are others who say: You know, we just can't be sure exactly what is happening so let's wait another 10 or 20 years because we can't measure it as precisely as we want. It is like saying: Oh, cancer is ravaging my body, but I am not going to take any medicine because I am not sure if it has affected 15 percent or 16 percent of my cells. Well, you know you have cancer, and you know you need to act.  So there we are. Let us not let our heads be buried in the tar sands. Climate chaos is real. It is ravaging our planet. It is because of human activity, and we do have the responsibility to respond.  The year 2018 was one of the four hottest years on record. Nine out of the ten of the hottest years on record occurred since the year 2000. If we are looking at this chart, we don't see the Earth becoming any cooler. We see the Earth becoming a lot warmer. Four of the hottest years on record, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015--that was the last 4 years having been the 4 hottest years on record. The odds of that happening by accident is essentially none.  We have some very serious scientific heft weighing in. In October, the United Nations climate panel said we must act dramatically within this next decade. A month later, on Black Friday, we had the release of the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--the Trump administration's ``Fourth National Climate Assessment''--and it concluded that ``Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities.''  There was a report from the Global Carbon Project that which found that global carbon emissions are going up. They went up 0.7 percent in 2018, hitting a record breaking 37.1 metric tons around the world. That is human activity putting out carbon dioxide that acts as a blanket on the planet. This isn't some new thought.  We go back to 1959. We had an eminent scientist who became better known for his work in the nuclear world, but he was asked to address the 100th anniversary of the petroleum industry. At that speech in 1959, he said: The energy you have unleashed and harnessed can do dramatic things to change the world, but you have a couple of challenges. One challenge is that there isn't an infinite amount of petroleum in the ground. Another challenge is it creates carbon dioxide. It doesn't look like a pollutant because you can't see it and you can't smell it, but in fact, it traps heat. I think he framed it more scientifically, that it traps infrared energy.  He said that is going to be a problem, and, of course, we are seeing that problem all the time now. You don't need these scientific reports out of a global panel or a fourth assessment from the administration to tell us what is going on because we see the facts on the ground.  In my home State of Oregon, you can't move around the State without seeing the impact. In Eastern Oregon, you have the warmer winter. It is not killing the pine beetles. So the pine beetles are killing the trees. More pine beetles and less trees is not a good thing.  If you are over on the coast, the oyster men will tell you they had a big crisis in 2008 and 2009 because all of the baby oysters were dying, not because of a bacteria but because the acidity in the Pacific Ocean has gone up. How is that related? Because carbon dioxide is absorbed by the ocean and becomes carbonic acid. We burn so much carbon dioxide that we changed the acidity of the ocean. Can you imagine that is possible? It seems impossible, but it speaks to how much carbon dioxide we released within a few decades of human civilization on this planet.  You can keep going on with this story around Oregon. Our kelp beds are disappearing. They provide protection for all kinds of fish species. The kelp are dying because the blue sea urchins are eating them. The blue sea urchins are expanding rapidly because the starfish are dying because the ocean got too warm for them. It is one story after another. There is less irrigation water, less snowpack, warmer streams, and harsher conditions for trout and salmon all within the State of Oregon, and there are similar stories throughout our Nation.  Perhaps the most destructive factor, though, has been the increased number of forest fires. There are bigger fires, hotter fires, and a longer fire season. They are not just ravaging our forests but producing smoke that has a huge impact on our towns. We take a lot of pride in our wine in Oregon, and a lot of our grapes had smoke taint and weren't usable this last year.  We have towns where furniture salesmen said they couldn't sell the furniture because it had the lingering smell of smoke.  It had an impact on the entertainment world. The Shakespeare Festival had to shut down and partially move inside to smaller venues, which is having a huge impact on their finances and a huge impact on the tourism attraction.  This stuff is real. It is why we should all be here, Democrats and Republicans, talking about the challenge and saying: What higher calling is there in our life than to come together to discuss this honestly and to work together to find solutions?  This isn't something where we can just say that the next generation can deal with it because the effects are cumulative. They build up. They become worse. It is a lot worse now than it was 10 years ago, and 10 years from now, it will be more so.  There is no easy, fast way to strip the carbon dioxide back out of the air. We can work at it, but it is not easy. We can plant more trees, yes, but, meanwhile, those hotter fires are killing more trees. Those pine beetles are killing more trees. In other words, it is urgent. The time to act is now.  In 1988 George H. W. Bush ran for President as an environmentalist. He announced he was going to take on global warming. His opponent, the Democrat, ran on the coal industry. That is not the same partisan alliance as you might hear today. George H. W. Bush said: ``Our land, water and soil support a remarkable range of human activities, but they can only take so much and we must remember to treat them not as a given but as a gift.''  Those words should echo in this Chamber. We have other words in this Chamber that seem to not address all of the facts that are right in front of us. One individual said: ``The satellite says it ain't happening.'' Well, one could probably pick out some one piece of data from one satellite somewhere and say it doesn't show the story, but you collect all the data together and it is happening.  Here is a chart of how the globe is warming over time. It shows the difference in average temperatures. Here we are with just one tiny cache where there is a significant drop in temperature. There is a little bit of white and light blue showing that it stayed about the same, and there is a whole lot of red saying things are getting a lot worse. That is the collected data. Maybe there is some satellite that took a picture of one little spot here, but to cherry-pick data like that is dishonest.  We can't afford to pretend that things are OK when we are facing such a dramatic challenge to our blue-green home in the universe. NOAA, or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, works at this, and they record all kinds of data from all around the world.  Here is another chart that shows the Earth's climate record. This one shows the zigs and zags over time. We are going back to 1880, but if we look from 1880 to 1980, we see a significant rise in the temperature of the planet. If we go from 1980 until now, it is this absolutely frightening horror show of increasing temperature. That is what is happening when we talk about snowpacks. We talk about glaciers, we talk about coral, we talk about pine beetles, and we talk about 100 of these things where there is that feedback. All of those affect humans. Those aren't just some abstract things, like if a tree falls in the woods but nobody hears it, did it really happen? Did we really hear it? Does it matter? No.  These reverberate back on our quality of life in this planet, including security concerns. The civil war in Syria that produced millions of refugees trying to get to Europe started with an extended drought because of the stresses of a warming planet.  Our military weighs in and says that climate chaos accentuates all the security concerns we have. It creates instability around the world. If one doesn't want to listen to the scientists, how about if we listen to our own military?  That is what the discussion of Senator Carper's resolution is all about. That is what the Green New Deal is all about. The Green New Deal says a few simple things. It says we have a big problem. Check. Yes, we do. It says we need to take it on boldly and aggressively. Check. Yes, we do. It says when we take it on boldly, we can create millions of jobs, and that will be a good thing for our economy. Check. Yes, it is.  Creating those jobs is good. It says when we do that, we shouldn't leave our frontline communities behind. We should make sure those communities--rural communities and inner-city communities that have been left behind previously in different economic expansions--can't be left behind now. Check. That is absolutely right.  Let's make this economic surge benefit everyone in every community, with special attention to communities that have been struggling.  My colleague is here from Virginia. I am so glad he is. I am talking a lot about what is happening on the west coast of America. Perhaps he will fill us in a little bit on the perspective from the east coast. This is not one isolated spot on our planet. This is a concern to all of us. We need bipartisan work on this. Some suggest we put a fee on carbon. Let's have that conversation. Some suggest we provide more subsidies to renewable energy. Let's have that conversation. Some say we should do a green workforce--green corps training. Let's talk about that. Let's talk about every strategy we can bring to bear and come to a collective plan because there is no space in the urgency of this issue for us to retreat into blue and red corners. There is no time. It is unacceptable.  I feel it is such a privilege to come to this floor and be part of this conversation, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do likewise. There are few issues that threaten us on this scale, but this one does. Let's work together to save our country and save our planet.  Thank you, Mr. President."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise and want to compliment my colleague from Oregon for putting on the table the need for this body--the greatest deliberative body in the world--to deliberate upon a situation of grave importance to the world--the reality of climate change and what we as American leaders can do to tackle it. I will take the floor to talk about this in the coming days. Mr. President, I actually rise now not on this topic, which affects Virginia significantly, especially sea level rise, but I want to talk a little about the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Venezuela. I do this on behalf of Venezuelans. I do this on behalf of Venezuelan-Americans, many of whom live in Virginia, but I also do it on behalf of democracies, because what is happening in Venezuela today demonstrates, really, in just one country, a global battle between democracies and authoritarian nations.  Authoritarian nations are supporting the regime of Maduro, and the democracies of the world are supporting the interim government of President Guaido.  If you want to know, circa 2019, in the battle being waged between authoritarians and democracies, Venezuela is a place where you can see it in one country. You see this global challenge between democracy and dictatorship.  The Maduro regime has been destroying Venezuela, which is home to the world's largest oil reserve, and it was once, in recent history, the richest country in all of Latin America. It is now in full-fledged economic and political collapse, with nearly 80 percent of the country's population living below the poverty line and more than half of the families unable to meet their basic food needs.  Right now, inflation in Venezuela is 2.7 million percent and will grow to 10 million percent this year, and most Venezuelans can't afford one meal a day. Medicines and other lifesaving commodities are too expensive for the average citizen to purchase, while Maduro and his colleagues and cronies syphon funds from state-owned enterprises into personal accounts and prohibit humanitarian assistance from entering the country.  Infants have starved to death because their families couldn't afford or access formula. Infectious diseases like malaria, measles, and diphtheria, which were previously eradicated in Venezuela, are emerging as public health system catastrophes.  Maduro is using the power of the state to subjugate and repress the Venezuelan people. His security forces use detention, torture, and lethal force against demonstrators and political opposition in what the United Nations and the Organization of American States called possible crimes against humanity.  It has provoked a massive refugee crisis. There are 3.4 million people and counting who have made the difficult decision to leave their homeland because life has become untenable. Many have come to Virginia and to the United States as they have fled two countries throughout the region and created Latin America's worst refugee crisis, which is worsening by the day. Make no mistake--this is a manmade political crisis in a beautiful nation with beautiful people that would have ample resources if it were not so poorly governed.  In May 2018, Maduro declared victory for a second term in office in an election so flawed that the Organization of American States, the European Union, and the United States refused to recognize it as legitimate.  Following months of protests, on January 23, the National Assembly, which is Venezuela's only democratic body, determined that Maduro had usurped the Office of the President, and in accordance with the Venezuelan Constitution's provision for succession--and this is important--the President of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, assumed the role of the Interim President of Venezuela. Again, that was done pursuant to Venezuelan constitutional law. The announcement, which I supported, was swiftly backed by the United States, by the Organization of American States, and by over 50 countries worldwide, including most of the democracies of the West. In contrast, which nations are supporting the Maduro regime? They are Russia, China, Iran, Syria, Turkey, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, and Belarus--authoritarian nations.  There is a clear international divide between democracies and authoritarians. We must defend our convictions and bolster the democracies of the world. It is about supporting the Venezuelan people, but it is also about sending an important message globally that the United States remains confident that democracy is the way for people to achieve their hopes and dreams, and when authoritarians try to crush the democratic desires of populations, the United States should be an ally.  The United States should never tell another nation who its leader should be. We have no business being in regime change. We support free and fair elections. We support constitutions. That is why I support the current interim Government of Venezuela, which has been designated pursuant to the Venezuelan Constitution.  I recently met with the Guaido interim government's representative to the United States. I was encouraged to hear that the National Assembly's goal was to move to a democratic system and replace the interim government with a national government that would follow free and transparent elections, which Maduro has blocked repeatedly. Support for this goal must continue to come from the international community, the Organization of American States, and other democracies.  A caution: As a missionary in Honduras in the 1970s, I lived in a military dictatorship, and I am keenly aware of the history and the legacy of U.S. intervention in the Americas. That is why I was very troubled and remain troubled by the Trump administration's threats of military intervention in Venezuela. That would be a massive mistake. The rhetoric is reckless and counterproductive. Our leaders should not be bombastic and enflame a delicate situation that could go in the direction of violence and civil unrest. In fact, the suggestion of U.S. military intervention actually strengthens the hand of the dictator because the Maduro dictatorship would like to blame Venezuela's economic challenges on Uncle Sam or the West rather than on its own mismanagement of the economy. The United States should not be making military threats against Venezuela.  There are many steps we can take, though, that would be appropriate. I support the increase in direct U.S. humanitarian aid for the Venezuelan people as the transition unfolds. It is unbelievable that for years, the government has refused to allow humanitarian aid to enter the country to help its own people. The scenes we have seen over the past weekend of roadblocks on highways entering Venezuela and the Venezuelan military fighting to stop humanitarian aid from reaching citizens epitomizes the Maduro regime's ongoing disregard for the plight of everyday people.  I support the long needed aid package that will help international organizations provide assistance inside Venezuela that interim President Guaido welcomes and that former President Maduro should welcome as well. That is why I joined Senator Menendez in cosponsoring the Venezuela Humanitarian Relief Act and the Rule of Law Act, and I will support them in their reintroductions.  I support the United States in its playing a role in convincing other nations and the Organization of American States to also stand for the people of Venezuela. OAS's leadership is very strong, but in the OAS, every member country has one vote. Venezuela has used its petroleum reserves to convince a number of Caribbean nations to back the dictatorship. I think the United States could use very plain diplomacy with Caribbean nations to get them to support the democracy, the current interim government, and we could do that and attain some significant success.  We should amplify the pressure we have applied by recognizing the interim government and deploying humanitarian assistance to the border. South America is absorbing 3.4 million refugees from Venezuela. The Trump administration condemns the brutality of the Maduro Government, but we are reducing our support for refugees from Venezuela and elsewhere.  I think the crisis warrants the extension of temporary protected status to the Venezuelans who are already in the United States. If the Trump administration is serious about helping Venezuela recover from a devastating crisis, it cannot require Venezuelans to return to a deteriorating security situation there.  It is not our place to dictate the negotiated terms of a resolution that will end this crisis. That is the role and the responsibility of the people of Venezuela and their representatives, but the United States and the international community should create the right environment for those negotiations to go forward, and they should provide the assistance to allow this transition to occur.  We don't want to see greater violence or greater civil war in Venezuela. Interim President Guaido's offer of amnesty to Maduro's military and political supporters who wish to end their support for autocratic rule is a good step, as is his explicit call for a transitional government and free and fair elections. His role should and must remain that of a steward until those elections take place pursuant to the Venezuelan Constitution.  There is an example in the region. The peace agreement in Colombia signaled the end of six decades of conflict. The hemisphere is on a trajectory toward peace with there being no ongoing hostilities in the more than 30 countries. It is critical that we keep it that way.  In conclusion, during my time in Honduras, I learned a very important prayer that we used to say at mealtime. It was this: (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:) ``Lord, give bread to those who hunger and hunger for justice to those who have bread.''  I call on this body and our colleagues in the international community to support the people of Venezuela in their quest for both bread and justice.  I yield the floor."

We were there to find out how the Alliance for Prosperity was being implemented, of which the Senator has been very supportive, as have I, in order to focus on hope, economic opportunity, crime, violence, and corruption.  The Alliance for Prosperity is focused on all of those matters. The United States puts up some of the money to address them, but we expect the other countries, including Honduras, to put up even more. It is like being at Home Depot--you can do it, and we can help. For every $1 in El Salvador, they put up $7, and we leverage our money to get the support of foundations, NGOs, private companies, and others to do their share. It is like turning the course of an aircraft carrier, and it is starting to turn.  Probably late this week--maybe tomorrow--I suspect Senator Merkley and I will want to have a colloquy on the floor.

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise this evening to continue to share with my colleagues the concerns I have about the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  I want to talk for a couple of minutes about an issue that is important for all Americans, and that is reducing mercury and air toxic pollution that affect the health especially of our children.  As a number of our colleagues know, reducing mercury and air toxic pollution from our Nation's powerplants is something of a passion for me, and I know it is for some of my colleagues, too, Democrats and Republicans. In my home State of Delaware, for example, we have made great strides in cleaning up our own air pollution. Unfortunately, a number of the upwind States to the west of us have not made the same commitment.  When I was the Governor of Delaware, I used to say I could have literally shut down Delaware's economy--I could have taken cars, trucks, and vans off of highways and shut down every business--and we still would have been out of compliance for air quality because of the pollution from other States. That is because over 90 percent of Delaware's air pollution comes from our neighboring States--over 90 percent.  This air pollution is not only dangerous to our hearts, to our lungs, and to our brains, but it also costs a great deal in doctor and hospital bills and in our quality of life. It makes healthcare costs in Delaware more expensive than in other places where they get cheap electricity. We ended up having to clean up our emissions. We have more expensive electricity and higher healthcare bills. It is just not fair.  Delaware has depended on the EPA to ensure our neighbors do their fair share so that we can protect our citizens in the First State. Just recently, Delaware petitioned the EPA under something called section 126 of the Clean Air Act, which requires upwind powerplants that are located in other States to turn on and fully operate their installed pollution technology. I will say that again--to use their installed pollution technology. They are not to turn it off but to leave it on.  Unfortunately, Mr. Wheeler ignored the health of Delawareans. The people of Maryland had the same concern, and the people of Connecticut had the same concern. He rejected all of our petitions. Talk about the Golden Rule. How is that consistent with the Golden Rule of treating other people the way you want to be treated? It flies in the face of it. We thought it was unforgivable.  Some of the air pollution that crosses our border is toxic. It is coming into our State as a silent killer. It wasn't too long ago that uncontrolled fossil fuel powerplants were the largest source of unregulated mercury and air toxics in the country--coal-fired powerplants.  For those who may not know, mercury and other toxics, such as lead, arsenic, benzene, and acid gases, that are emitted by uncontrolled coal-fired powerplants get into our airways, our waterways, and our seafood. As we breathe and ingest these air toxics, they build up in our bodies and cause cancer, respiratory illness, mental impairment, and even death.  Mercury pollution is especially dangerous for unborn children, who can suffer long-lasting neurological damage if they are exposed during their development at very early ages--even before they are born. The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated there is no safe level of mercury exposure for children--none.  Almost two decades ago, Senator Alexander and I led legislation that required utilities to reduce mercury emissions by 90 percent. At the time, most utilities told us that it could not be done or that it would be too expensive to achieve.  In 2012, which was a few years later, the EPA implemented something called the mercury and air toxics standards--we call it MATS--which also required utilities to reduce their mercury emissions by 90 percent and other air toxic emissions by half.  Just as with the bill introduced by Senator Alexander and me about a decade ago, many utilities claimed they could not meet those standards to reduce mercury and other air toxics. They predicted consumer rate spikes. They predicted mass powerplant closures. They predicted brownouts. They predicted blackouts. Luckily, those predictions were dead wrong. Under the 2012 MATS rule, the EPA determined it was appropriate and necessary to regulate air toxic plant emissions, like mercury, lead, arsenic, acid gases, and benzene, because of the health hazards of these pollutants. Today, believe it or not, 7 years later, every utility is now in compliance with the mercury and air toxics rule--every one.  Powerplant mercury emissions are down by over 80 percent from just 7 years ago.  Compliance with MATS was done faster than predicted and for one-third the cost. Imagine that, faster than predicted, for one-third the cost, and we have gotten better results than we could hope for as well.  Let me go on. Consumer retail prices are lower today than they were before MATS was implemented. We are also seeing health benefits, as I said, occur faster than expected originally, and despite some of the original opposition, everyone now has embraced MATS. Isn't that amazing?  All these utilities and folks who opposed what Senator Alexander and I were trying to do a decade ago, what the MATS rule that up to 12 years ago was trying to do--all the folks who were opposed to it then say: No, this is good. It didn't cost as much. We implemented it much faster than we had ever expected--better results than we had expected. So it is pretty amazing, a wonderful outcome--except over the December holiday break 2 months ago, for reasons unknown to me, Acting EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler signed a proposal to remove the legal underpinnings of the mercury and air toxics standards, remove the legal underpinnings of the MATS rule.  Mr. Wheeler says this action was not intended to get rid of the rule. He says it was necessary and that the proposal strikes a balance. Everyone--everyone--industry, environmental groups, health groups--knows that is just not so. It is just not so.  No court has ordered this action, no utilities are asking for this action, and this proposal is not intended to protect public health.  Here is what EPA has done. In the proposal, EPA mimics flawed arguments used in a recent Murray Energy lawsuit against the MATS rule.  Like the lawsuit, EPA uses outdated data and deems that some benefits--like reductions in cancer, reductions in birth defects, reduction in asthma attacks--are no longer important and shouldn't even be considered.  Think about that. Think about that. Based on this information, EPA determined it is no longer appropriate and necessary for the Agency to regulate powerplant air toxic emissions--no longer appropriate and necessary to regulate mercury, to regulate lead, arsenic, acid gases, benzene pollution from powerplants. Imagine that.  Yet the Agency also proposes to keep the MATS rule which regulates powerplant air toxic emissions in place, even though it is simultaneously saying that the rule is not appropriate and necessary. This confusing conclusion opens the door for future lawsuits to vacate the MATS rule entirely.  That is our concern--not just my concern but a broadly held concern. By undermining the legal foundation of MATS, this proposal unnecessarily puts the MATS rule in legal jeopardy, and despite Mr. Wheeler's claim that he doesn't plan to eliminate the standards themselves, EPA is still requesting public comment in the proposal on whether to do just that.  If EPA is successful and the MATS rule goes away, air pollution control technologies on coal plants across the country will be turned off, just like the coal plants listed in Delaware's 126 petitions and up in Pennsylvania and I think to our west in West VA.  On this issue, Mr. Wheeler seems to be all alone. Environmentalists, States, labor groups, coal-fired utilities, religious leaders, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce all agree that the lifesaving protections to limit mercury pollution should stay in place. They all agree. There are not a whole lot of things they all agree on. They all agree on this.  The stakeholders listed on this chart right over here over my shoulder and many more urge this administration not to move forward with their proposal--not to move forward. Mr. Wheeler has chosen to ignore the chorus of the stakeholders who all hoped he would chart a more responsible path.  In talking with my Republican friends, I know many of them can't make sense of the EPA's efforts to undermine the MATS rule. They are as confused as I am by why Mr. Wheeler would be taking a step that will hurt public health and, frankly, hurt the industries that are required to implement this technology and protect our health.  I had hoped we could try to help Mr. Wheeler course correct on this issue during the nomination process. That just doesn't seem to be happening. His lack of willingness to change course on the MATS rollbacks is very troubling to me and one of the reasons I cannot support his nomination to be EPA Administrator at this time.  I have fought for almost two decades in this body to protect our children from mercury and air toxic pollution from powerplants. I am not going to back down. I am not going to go away.  For my colleagues who are concerned about regulating mercury, I would ask that you join me in opposing Andrew Wheeler's nomination vote tomorrow.  I yield the floor."

After graduating from William Penn High School in 1977, Timmons enrolled in college and enlisted in the Delaware National Guard. With a childhood dream of becoming an airline pilot, her career in flight would begin that very summer on a C-130 airplane in Savannah, Georgia.  Despite her love of airplanes, Air Force rules prevented women from flying combat mission planes like the C-130. Due to these unfair regulations, she joined the Army National Guard in 1980 and would learn to fly noncombat Army helicopters like the UH-1 Huey.  Undeterred and committed to her dream, Timmons joined the Air Force Reserves, where she flew noncombat support missions. She soon realized her dream as Federal laws ended the discriminatory prohibition on women flying in combat missions, and during Operation Desert Storm, then-Captain Timmons would become one of the first women to fly in combat.  Following that operation, her career would come full circle as she rejoined the Delaware National Guard, flying the same C-130s she learned to fly on and to operate in the beginning.  On January 8, 2012, then-Brigadier General Timmons would make history by becoming the Delaware Air National Guard's first female commander, and again on February 1, 2017, when she was promoted to the rank of major general and made Adjutant General of the Delaware National Guard, the Governor's chief military adviser, commanding 1,500 soldiers and 1,100 airmen.  During her storied 42-year career, she earned a Bronze Star for her service in Afghanistan and has flown over 5,200 hours in the cockpit, including 400 combat hours during contingencies spanning from Operations Desert Shield to Inherent Resolve. She served on the National Guard's Joint Diversity Executive Council and the Air Force Reserve Policy Committee. She has received numerous honors, including induction into the Delaware Aviation Hall of Fame and the Delaware Women's Hall of Fame.  By refusing to compromise on her dream, Timmons broke down barriers, blazed trails, and inspired women to let nothing stand in their way in service to our Nation.  I join Senator Carper and Senator Coons in thanking Major General Carol Timmons for her over four decades of service to our State and our country, and we wish her the very best."

                    "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the President's national emergency declaration.  First and foremost, I support President Trump, and I support the wall. Walls work to protect our security, combat human trafficking, stop the flow of drugs, and encourage legal immigration.  Democrats have pushed for zero wall money, open borders, and abolishing ICE. These policies make our Nation vulnerable and threaten our security, and it is a tragedy.  So I don't blame the President for proposing extreme measures to respond to their extreme policies and tactics. However, yesterday, I made the difficult decision to disapprove of this type of unilateral executive action, just as I could not approve any such unilateral action by any President.  I am 100 percent with President Trump for building the wall, but the emergency declaration only maintains the status quo. Securing our border is fundamental to who we are as a sovereign nation, and that is why I voted over a dozen times for stronger border security, including $25 billion for the wall last year. Unfortunately, as the President recognized, himself, this national emergency could be tied up in the courts for years with no guarantee that judges will rule in favor of the wall to be built. It is Congress' job to provide the resources our Nation needs to keep us safe, and I am concerned that if this is tied up in the courts, we will be stuck with the status quo of no wall and a border that isn't secure.  My vote to disapprove of this unilateral executive action had nothing to do with the merits or need to build President Trump's wall; it was about our Constitution and this body's exclusive Article I powers to make laws and use the power of the purse.  I spoke out strongly when President Obama said that if Congress didn't act, he would use the pen and the phone, and then he proceeded to act alone on DACA and act alone in reappropriating money within ObamaCare and regulating every mud puddle in America.  Remember, President Obama initially said he couldn't act alone on DACA because he wasn't a king or an emperor. After a robust debate in Congress, he flip-flopped and took executive action. His executive action took away Congress' authority to act, and DACA still isn't solved.  These unilateral actions by President Obama put more power in the hands of unelected people sitting in cubicles in Washington, D.C., and they turned elected Representatives into elected bystanders. When Representatives become irrelevant, citizens become irrelevant, and we the people are powerless against faceless, unelected bureaucrats.  Unilateral executive actions set bad precedent. If it is okay for the executive branch to act alone after the legislative branch doesn't reach an agreement, where does that take us?  Governor Jay Inslee already has said that he would be willing to declare a national emergency on climate change allowing for drastic Federal action that would never have to be approved by Congress.  What if, without any congressional approval, a future President used a national emergency to take money from our VA clinics, Fairchild Air Force Base, or force management at the Colville National Forest to force a Green New Deal on the American people?  Whether it is at the border or upholding the separation of powers in our Constitution, we, conservative Republicans, must be consistent about being the party for the rule of law. It is those principles that define us.  Mr. Speaker, I say to Speaker Pelosi: I am 100 percent with Trump on the wall. I am also 100 percent with the Constitution. As Representatives of the people, it is our call to put aside any personal ambition or partisan divides so that the people are protected.  This isn't about political parties, personalities, or power. It never has been. It is about making sure that the promise of America is never breached and knowing that the only ones who can preserve it are we the people. I take this seriously and will always lead by upholding my Article I constitutional authority to be a strong voice for those I have the privilege of serving in the United States House of Representatives."

The 11th District of New Jersey understands that universal background checks are a responsible way to address the gun violence epidemic in this country. It is a way to keep our communities safe.  Here in New Jersey, we know that successful, responsible gun ownership looks a lot like the legislation we have on the books. We have good gun safety laws, but they are constantly undermined by States with weak gun safety laws.  As a Federal prosecutor, I worked on cases where we traced illegal guns to neighboring States with weak gun safety laws. That is why it is so important that we have stronger Federal gun safety laws. Gun violence is a national problem, and it deserves a national response.  Mr. Speaker, I grew up in a culture of gun safety. My father is a hunter, and he taught me how to shoot. I went on to serve in the United States Navy, and I was qualified as an expert shot in the M16, the Colt 45, and the 9-millimeter Beretta.  I am joined today by a fellow freshman veteran, the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania, and we have been trained and know the power of these weapons and the damage that they can do. Universal background checks are an easy step that we can take to improve gun safety in this country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan)."

Jamie had just graduated college and was looking for a permanent postcollege job. In the meantime, he was working in a pizza shop in West Philadelphia when his life was tragically cut short in January 2004 when a worker accidentally shot him. This was not done in malice but was the result of a coworker accidentally mishandling a gun. Jamie passed away when he was 22 years old. Today would have been his 38th birthday.  I rise for the 1,600 Pennsylvanians and nearly 40,000 Americans who have lost their lives to gun-related incidents in 2017 alone.  The Loepers, like mine, are a military family. We understand the values of responsible gun ownership but also that we must take commonsense steps to reduce gun violence in our communities. We have seen for far too long far too many gun-related tragedies over the past several years with Congress doing nothing. We must act now."

                    "speech":"Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House overwhelmingly passed the Natural Resources Management Act, including a provision sponsored by Senator Feinstein and me that would establish California's first National Heritage Area, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area.  I want to thank my House colleagues from California, Representatives Matsui, DeSaulnier, McNerney, Thompson, Harder, Lofgren, and Bera, for their support as cosponsors of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area Act, H.R. 357.  I also want to thank Chairman Grijalva of the Natural Resources Committee for bringing the bipartisan public lands bill to the floor of the House following Senate passage earlier this month.  I sponsored this legislation to establish the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area since 2011 along with my colleague Senator Feinstein.  A National Heritage Area designation will help conserve the California Delta, which I have had the great pleasure of calling my home for the last 40 years. This iconic working landscape is central to California's life and is the most productive watershed and delta in the Western United States and, indeed, from the coast of Alaska to Chile.  Specifically, this legislation authorizes $10 million in Federal grants for local development of cultural heritage issues, historic preservation, and working lands conservation projects.  This Federal grant funding will be available for the next 15 years to support local governments, historical societies, and nonprofit organizations throughout the delta.  Our National Heritage Area Act proposal is endorsed by the Delta Stewardship Council and the Delta Counties Coalition, consisting of Sacramento, Solano, Contra Costa, Yolo, and San Joaquin Counties, all of which represent the delta. It is also supported by the Delta Chambers of Commerce and Visitors Bureau, Restore the Delta, and the National Parks Conservation Association.  California's Delta Protection Commission is charged with developing the management plan for the new national heritage area.  Lastly, I want to address some of the persistent misconceptions about national heritage area designations, not only this new one but also those throughout the United States. Such designations do not affect individual property rights, water rights, landownership, or local land use decisions, nor does the designation affect hunting and fishing. Rather, the national heritage area program simply makes Federal grant funds administered by the National Park Service available for local projects.  The national heritage area program and planning process is collaborative and voluntary, meaning that local groups, businesses, and landowners can choose to participate or not. I look forward to continuing to work with local governments, county governments, local businesses, communities, local action groups, and all others interested during the public management planning process.  After nearly a decade of work, the President is expected to sign the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area Act into law. We thank all who supported the legislation and the local entities that have done so.  This is truly a historic achievement for the entire delta, including the farming communities, the families, and the immigrant communities who have settled in the area over the last 150 years and generated the rich cultural and agricultural heritage."

Together, they established Ekenywa. Ekenywa works to dig wells, sometimes hundreds of feet deep, to establish a reliable water source to communities and schools in rural Kenya. The creation of these wells allows for solar-powered irrigation systems, enabling communities to farm year-round, even in the presence of a drought.  Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of the Gasperi family and Ekenywa. They are truly making a difference in the lives of countless people across the world.

                    "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the visionary and unwavering leadership of civil rights icon and notable Oklahoman Ms. Clara Luper.  Six months ago, I got to witness history as Oklahoma City commemorated the 60th anniversary of the sit-ins she organized. I rise today because, even as a fifth-generation Oklahoman, I realized how little I knew.  Clara Luper and her students sparked a movement, the sit-ins that led into our Nation's civil rights movement. They deserve to be a household name.  Clara Luper made her mark in a time when people of color couldn't even walk into the front door of Oklahoma City businesses. They were relegated to hidden back rooms.  But she had a vision for equality, a heart for service, and a commitment to justice. She, in her words, ``believed in a sun when it didn't shine and the rain when it didn't fall.'' She knew that Oklahoma and this country could be a place where everyone is treated with respect, dignity, and humanity.  Even as a history teacher at Dunjee High School in Spencer, Oklahoma, Ms. Luper instilled those principles in her students. Her steadfast commitment to ending racism and systemic discrimination inspired her to organize America's first sit-in.  In August 1958, she and 14 of her NAACP Youth Council students walked up to a lunch counter they knew would refuse them, and they ordered a hamburger and a Coke. They were denied, but they did not waver. They knew what was on the line because, in Ms. Luper's words, ``within that hamburger was the whole essence of democracy.''  At their own personal peril, they returned each day with more people until they broke the barrier. It was never easy. The protesters were verbally and physically assaulted, and Ms. Luper received death threats.  Because of Ms. Luper and her students' fearlessness and determination, the Katz Drug Stores integrated their lunch counters, not just in Oklahoma City but also in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa.  When the 1958 sit-in happened in Oklahoma City, a group of college students in North Carolina were inspired by what had taken place in Oklahoma City, and they took note. In 1961, those students launched the Greensboro, North Carolina, sit-in at the Woolworth lunch counter, which fueled momentum within the civil rights movement.  It didn't end there. For years, Ms. Luper and others continued their fight. The sacrifices continued, too.  Authorities arrested Ms. Luper 26 times during her fight for freedom. Clara Luper empowered young people to imagine a future brighter than their present and taught them how to make that future a reality.  She changed lives and planted seeds of ethical leadership into those who were lucky enough to be mentored by her. Each of her former students talks about the pivotal role Ms. Luper played in instilling confidence, character, and dignity in them.  Generations reap the benefit of her sacrifice and efforts to integrate not only businesses in Oklahoma City but educational spaces.  Ms. Luper integrated the history department at the University of Oklahoma, becoming the first Black graduate of that master's program. Her contributions are reflected across our own State, in a namesake scholarship program at Oklahoma City University, a corridor on the northeast side of Oklahoma City, a classroom at the University of Central Oklahoma, by the designation of the Oklahoma City Public Schools District building as The Clara Luper Center, and naming the African American studies department at the University of Oklahoma after her.  As a lifelong Oklahoman and representative of the Fifth Congressional District, and as an American, I recognize how we are beneficiaries of Clara Luper's efforts to create a more just and equitable place to live. I cannot and will not take that history and impact for granted.  Although we have come so far because of her sacrifices and the sacrifices of other heroes during the civil rights era, there is so much work to be done. Even with the number of accolades given to her, the best way we can honor Ms. Luper is to uphold her legacy through commitment to justice and equality in the policies that we propose.  She knew that democracy is not a spectator sport. It is our duty as a Congress and as Americans to make good on the constitutional promise of establishing justice and ensuring domestic tranquility, so we must continue to work for an inclusive, equitable place for everyone to live and feel safe, as well as to build an economy where every American has the opportunity to thrive.  Thank you to the sit-inners, and thank you to Clara Luper for your resilience and for giving us the torch to carry."

Time and time again, our communities have experienced gun violence due to the absence of commonsense gun safety measures.  Only 12 days ago, five people, four of whom were my constituents, left their homes for work at the Henry Pratt Company in Aurora, Illinois, and never returned. Their lives were taken by an unspeakably horrific act of gun violence.  It is time to take immediate action to help safeguard our communities from gun violence, and today, for the first time in more than two decades, the House of Representatives will vote on a major gun safety bill, and I will support it.  H.R. 8 is a strong step toward making our communities safer, and I look forward to continuing to work on commonsense legislation that balances gun rights with the safety of our communities."

We have promised the American people that Congress would take steps to reduce gun violence, and this bill is a critical first step toward doing so.  During the past 4 weeks, as the Judiciary Committee, and now the full House, have discussed the issue of gun violence, I have cited grim statistics. Nearly 40,000 Americans lost their lives because of guns in 2017. In fact, every day in America, on average, 34 people are murdered with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack.  Gun violence of this magnitude is a distinctly American problem. A country-to-country comparison is shocking. For example, in 2011, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, just 30. The United States, that year, about 35,000.  A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that, compared to 22 other high-income countries, the gun-related murder rate in the United States is 25 times higher. Even when you adjust for population differences, Americans are disproportionately killed by gun violence.  Almost 25 years to the day after the Brady Act was first implemented, expanding our current background check requirement to cover virtually all gun transfers is one of the steps we must take to address this crisis.  Under current law, only licensed firearms dealers are required to conduct a background check before transferring a gun to another person. This means that gun shows, online sales, and other private sales can completely evade this vital tool for ensuring that guns do not get into the wrong hands. It is time to close this dangerous loophole.  This bill would make it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who is not so licensed without a background check. Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary background check before the transfer could be finalized.  The bill also provides a number of exceptions to this requirement, including gifts to family members and transfers for hunting, target shooting, and instances of imminent death or great bodily harm.  The FBI's internal assessment demonstrated that checks processed through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, often called NICS, are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, the background checks are completed within 90 seconds. H.R. 8 will provide an accurate and speedy mechanism to help ensure firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.  There is no reason to continue to make it easy for people who are legally prohibited from possessing firearms to acquire them by circumventing the background check process. H.R. 8 would close this dangerous loophole and save many, many lives. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this vital legislation today.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time."

                    "speech":"Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Today I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8, the so-called Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. This is bad legislation that fails to make anyone safer in any regard.  I have been listening here, sitting on the floor for just the last few minutes and listening to those who came up and were happy about this bill coming forward today, and they mentioned many acts of mass violence and situations that have happened. The sad part about it is they claim this is the answer and the first step. In actuality, it is, at best, a side step, and it may actually be a step backwards and will not do what it is being claimed to do.  All this legislation will do is burden law-abiding citizens wishing to exercise their Second Amendment rights, including defending themselves from the gun-toting criminals this bill does nothing to combat. H.R. 8 foolishly presumes criminals who flout existing laws will suddenly submit themselves to background checks.  Are Members who support this bill delusional enough to think a criminal trading cocaine to another criminal for a firearm will give consideration to H.R. 8 and go to the nearest gun store to submit to a background check? That is absurd.  Most of us will agree that criminals are not going to do that anyway. My concern is what it actually does in practice to those who are not criminals.  Not only is it foolish to think they will start following the law, it is also foolish to think it is going to in any way make our country safer.  My Democratic friends have exploited every mass shooting, calling for universal background checks, but H.R. 8 would not have stopped a single mass shooting.  These strategies do, however, share one thing in common. Over and over, we see issues of mental health and missed opportunities for authorities to intercede.  Let me just say, Mr. Chair, I share the concern. I am going to share, in just a moment, actual, real things that actually could make a difference in helping to stem the tide of mass violence in our country. But doing this, we have to understand that this bill does not do that, and what may make you feel good may not heal you. That has to be understood.  Look at the recent workplace shooting in Illinois, where the gunman murdered five people. That could have been prevented, but not by H.R. 8. All law enforcement had to do was enforce existing law. The gunman was prohibited from possessing firearms.  In January 2014, he was issued an Illinois firearm owner's identification card. That March, he applied to buy a handgun from a gun dealer. Five days later, he took possession of the gun, having inexplicably passed a background check. That month, he applied for a concealed carry permit. During a background check for the permit, his felony conviction was flagged.  Illinois police revoked his firearm card and sent him a letter telling him to relinquish the firearm. Not surprisingly, the felon did not comply. Had authorities seized the firearm between March 2014 and February 2019, they could have saved five lives.  Aurora, Illinois, is not the only missed opportunity to prevent tragedy. We know about missed opportunities in Parkland; Aurora, Colorado; Sutherland Springs; Virginia Tech; and others.  The common problem here, Mr. Chair, is clear. It is not a lack of background checks.  With H.R. 8, Democrats refuse to acknowledge the human factors leading to these events, but Republicans have a bill to help law enforcement coordinate responses to mental health concerns and other mass violent threat information. You know what else H.R. 8 doesn't address? The primary ways criminals acquire firearms. Last month, DOJ revealed nearly half of criminals obtained firearms via theft or the black market. The survey also revealed that a mere 0.8 percent of criminals purchased their firearms at gun shows.  If this bill won't prevent mass shootings and address violent crime, what will it do? It will keep law-abiding citizens from protecting themselves. Under this bill, Mr. Chair, a battered woman with a protection order against her abuser who borrows a firearm for self-defense would be a criminal. It would criminalize the selling of a firearm without a background check to someone with a valid permit allowing them to possess, acquire, or carry a firearm. If that person walked into a gun store, they could present that permit and not undergo a NICS check.  On the other hand, there are solutions to prevent mass violence and gun crime. The Mass Violence Prevention Act, which I introduced earlier this week, is one. The MVP Act directly addresses challenges in law enforcement coordination and response. It would reduce the flow of firearms into the black market, and it would bolster law enforcement's ability to prosecute criminals for firearm offenses.  If reducing gun violence, Mr. Chair, is the Democrats' concern, the MVP Act is legislation that we should be considering today, not H.R. 8. Talk to me or my staff about cosponsoring this evidence-based, commonsense legislation. Unlike H.R. 8, the MVP Act could have prevented tragedies such as Parkland.  Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, my Democratic colleagues, by putting this forward and continuing the same narrative, are not actually interested in stopping gun violence. I take the intent to be good; I do not question the motive. All of us in our life do not want to see the tragedies unfold. But this is not the way forward.  This is another thing put out to the very ones who have suffered, telling them we are helping them, while at the same time not telling them the truth about the bill, a bill that guts its own ability to enforce itself, a bill that actually, possibly, would keep people from purchasing firearms because of an unlimited price of a background check.  The question that I have about this bill, Mr. Chair, is not what actually could happen with this. It is what actually will be hurt by this as we move forward.  With that, I believe that we are being misled. The victims of mass violence are being misled by this bill, H.R. 8, because it would not stop what they have been promised that it would stop.  Mr. Chair, for that, I am profoundly sorry. But because of that, I call on my colleagues to reject H.R. 8 and to support real solutions.  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time."

It is about time that Congress takes this issue seriously, and I am pleased that this bipartisan bill has been brought to the House floor with the urgency this issue deserves.  In recent years, our Nation has experienced an increase in mass shootings, and our Nation is appropriately horrified. However, mass shootings are just one symptom of our gun violence epidemic. The daily toll of shootings occurs in communities across our country, on our streets, in our schools, and even in our houses of worship.  As Aalayah Eastmond testified before the Judiciary Committee earlier this month, 1 year after the terrible shooting that took the lives of 17 students and staff and injured 17 others at her high school in Parkland, Florida: ``Minority communities bear the heaviest burden of gun violence in this country.''  The impact on our young people is simply unacceptable. Every day, 47 children and teens are shot in this country. Eight of these young people die, and 39 are shot and survive.  Citizens across this country such as Diane Latiker, who also testified before the committee, are taking it upon themselves to organize and engage in community-based efforts to reduce gun violence and to assist the young people it affects. We in Congress must match their courage and commitment with action of our own.  I support H.R. 8 because it will reduce gun violence by narrowing the avenues for criminals and other prohibited persons from obtaining guns.  Certainly, there is no single change to our gun laws that will prevent every shooting, but enacting measures that will help prevent some of them is clearly the right thing to do.  Mr. Chair, that is why I support this bill, and I ask my colleagues to do the same."

Now, they can't do that outright; they know that. So they do it through cynical measures like this, which weave a web of laws so intricate, that, sooner or later, everyone can be caught up in them.  This law affects not just transfer of ownership, but any transfer of weapon for any period of time. Suppose you exchange shotguns with a friend on a hunt and then separate for a period of time, or you loan a gun to your next-door neighbor of 20 years who is being victimized by a stalker, or you give a gun to your stepson or your great-grandson. Under any of these innocent scenarios and countless more like them, you are guilty of a Federal crime.  These flaws were all pointed out to the bill's sponsors, and none were addressed. Why not? I think the reason should be obvious.  Last October, a 10-year study by Johns Hopkins and UC Davis concluded that California's universal background check law had no effect on gun homicides or suicides--none.  The purpose of this bill is not public safety. That is just a deceptive facade. Its true purpose is to make gun ownership so legally hazardous, so fraught with legal booby traps and draconian penalties, that no honest and law-abiding citizen would want to take the risk of gun ownership.  Most criminals already get their guns illegally and are unconstrained by laws like this. Make no mistake, this is aimed squarely at law-abiding citizens, moving us closer to a society where decent people are defenseless and armed criminals are kings."

Millions and millions of gun sales happen without a background check at all. In fact, one in five, 22 percent, of guns are sold with no background check. That means criminals, domestic abusers, and people prohibited due to mental illness can get a gun. This bill changes that.  We also know that States that have enhanced background checks have lower rates of gun homicides, gun suicide rates, and gun trafficking.  This is a commonsense bill to protect the American people from the scourge of gun violence.  Finally, after 8 years of pleading with our Republican colleagues to do something about gun violence in this country, to take up a bill--we had a sit-in to try to force a vote--finally, today, we are taking our first step to reduce gun violence in this country by passing H.R. 8.

Without an unconstitutional Federal gun registry, this bill is impossible to enforce.  There is no gun show loophole. Federal law is the same regardless of where a firearm sale takes place. Federal law requires all firearms dealers to be licensed and to initiate a background check before transferring a firearm to a nondealer, regardless of where that transfer takes place.  As for nondealers, Federal law prohibits transferring a firearm to anyone known or believed to be prohibited from possessing firearms. That is already the law.  According to DOJ, less than 1 percent of criminals in State prison for firearm crimes get their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows. According to ATF, 6 percent of Federal armed career criminals got their firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows.  Online sales loophole: There is no online sales loophole. The Federal law is the same regardless of how people communicate about selling or buying a firearm.  Federal law prohibits anyone, licensed firearm dealer or not, from shipping a firearm to a person who lives in another State unless the receiver is also a dealer. Dealers must document all firearms they receive.  H.R. 8 also fails to include many of the realistic exceptions to the new background check requirements for private transfers, such as transfers between law enforcement officers outside of their duties, transfers to concealed carry permit holders, transfers to museums or licensed collectors, transfers to Active Duty military, and many more.  H.R. 8 includes an exception to the background check transfer if the transfer is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. But that transfer is only allowed for the length of time that it is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm. It doesn't even define those terms.  What about a false alarm? Does it extend to domestic violence fears if the person is not getting attacked immediately? Gun rights groups have argued that without a definition, this provision would only provide protection in instances where it is likely too late for the victim to make it out safely.  Finally, H.R. 8 would not have prevented any of the recent high-profile shootings. In those cases, the shooter either passed a Federal background check or stole the firearms they used."

Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 8, a bill that criminalizes gun transfers between law-abiding citizens who have no criminal record and no criminal intent.  The bill includes several flawed and unworkable exceptions. Take the law enforcement exception. It allows the police to transfer a firearm, but criminalizes transfers to law enforcement.  Under this bill, a parent whose child finds a gun in a park commits a Federal crime if the parent surrenders the gun to police.  Under this bill, a citizen commits a Federal crime if they participate in a local gun buy-back program.  Under this bill, an attorney commits a Federal crime when they turn a client's gun over to the police to clear the client through ballistics testing.  Will criminalizing cooperation with law enforcement make us safer? The majority apparently thinks so, and I think it is crazy.  The Democrats' bill gives special privileges to the bodyguards of the wealthy elite, like former Mayor Bloomberg, who is funding the special interest advocacy for this bill. He can afford to hire bodyguards. But average Americans, who rely on the Second Amendment as their source of personal protection, are not given similar protections.  Nothing should be more offensive to this body than a bill that denies citizens their endowed rights while giving wealthy elites special protections, privileges, and dispensations. But that is H.R. 8.  Take the family exception; the rule allows a vote on an amendment to ensure that transfers between parent and child include stepparents and stepchildren. What about transfers between a foster parent and foster child? This bill says foster relationships are not worthy of the same respect and equal treatment. Every Member of this body should be ashamed to vote for this bill that reflects such terrible policy and discrimination.  Take the Good Samaritan exception, allowing transfers where a threat of death or harm is imminent. Imminent means death is menacingly near, a standard so strict that it is, frankly, too late to transfer a gun once it is obvious a gun is needed for protection.  Under this standard, it is illegal to loan a gun to a victim of domestic violence for her protection until the transferor is practically witnessing a murder in progress.  This standard would also prevent a gun owner who has intermittent suicidal thoughts, a known side-effect of certain prescription medications, from legally transferring a gun--his own gun--to a friend for safekeeping.  Because this bill criminalizes transfers between law-abiding Americans, while doing nothing to curb criminals' access to guns, this bill provides the American public with a false sense of security.  Because this bill includes unworkable exceptions that will mislead people into thinking a gun transfer is legal when it is not, this bill provides law-abiding gun owners with a false sense of immunity.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this totally and completely unconstitutional legislation that would deprive people of their constitutional rights to keep and bear arms."

Not to mention, it is essentially unenforceable without a national gun registry. But, let's be honest, that is where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle want to end up: registering firearms so they can systematically take them away. We must stop our Nation from falling down this slippery slope.  I think we can all agree that something needs to be done to stop the illegal ownership and misuse of firearms, but H.R. 8 is not the answer. This legislation would have done nothing to prevent many of the prominent tragedies that occurred in my home State of Florida.  The shooter at Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland passed a background check. The shooter at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando passed a background check. And, just weeks ago, a man who murdered five women in my district passed a background check.  H.R. 8 would have done nothing to stop these violent acts, just like the previous attempts to require universal background checks have done nothing to prevent actual crimes.  If Democrats are serious about gun violence, they would have voted for my amendment. I filed an amendment in committee that would have required law enforcement to be notified upon the attempt of someone to purchase a firearm and failed a background check. Law enforcement would have been notified. But instead of supporting policies that curtail legal possession of firearms, the Democrats on both the Judiciary Committee and the Rules Committee rejected my proposal. How is that unreasonable?  Mr. Chairman, I stand for the Constitution. I stand for freedom. And I stand for the Second Amendment. That is why I am not voting for this proposal."

                    "speech":"Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and I thank him for his leadership as chair of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing us to this place promptly. It is an historic day in the Congress of the United States.  Mr. Chairman, I thank our distinguished colleague from California, Mr.   Mike Thompson, for his relentless, persistent leadership to make America safer by bringing forth commonsense background check legislation. He is a gun owner and a veteran. He has been on both sides of the gun. He is a hunter. He is an advocate for the Second Amendment. And, as he said, if this had anything to diminish that, he would not have his name on it.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this strong, bipartisan bill and join Mr. Thompson in commending Mr. King of New York for making this initiative bipartisan from the start, in the previous Congress and now. It is a long, overdue commonsense action to end the epidemic of gun violence in America.  Let us salute, again, the persistent leadership of so many in this body. And, again, Mr. Thompson, as chair of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force; he has worked in a bipartisan way to protect our communities, and we are grateful to him for that.  We can do all the inside maneuvering that we want, and that is really important and essential, but, without the outside mobilization, we cannot enjoy the success of saving lives and making progress. So I want to thank the courageous advocates who are here today, in the gallery, including March for Our Lives and Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, and so many more. They have made a complete difference.  As President Lincoln said: ``Public sentiment is everything. With it you can accomplish almost anything, without it almost nothing.''  I thank them for building public sentiment to a point where now about 90 percent of the American people support commonsense background check legislation, including many members, courageously, of the National Rifle Association.  This bill is proudly bipartisan because gun violence prevention should not be a Democratic or Republican issue. Gun violence does not discriminate by party or politics. It reaches into all of our communities, our schools, our places of worship, our workplaces, and our streets, and it will require all of our courage to defeat it.  Last night, we were at an occasion to mark the 25th anniversary of the Brady Bill. Some of us were in Congress at that time. Many of us here, then or not, admire the courageous work of Sarah and Jim Brady to make the country a safer place by reducing gun violence.  Twenty-five years ago, we enacted the Brady background check system, which has denied more than 3 million sales to potentially dangerous individuals. Yet, the Brady Bill does not stop people from purchasing guns from unlicensed sellers without a background check at gun shows and online.  We must pass H.R. 8 to close this dangerous loophole and keep our communities safe from gun violence. That is what we are intending to do today. George Bernard Shaw said that: ``It is the mark of a truly intelligent person to be moved by statistics,'' and here are the facts:  Nearly 40,000 lives are cut short every year from gun violence.  An average of 47 children and teenagers are killed by guns every single day. As I said, it is all about the children, the children, the children.  We read about the tragic mass murders that have happened in our country, and they stir us to action, hopefully. Here it has been they stir us to a moment of silence, and now, finally, to action. But it is every day. Every day 47 children and teenagers killed by guns.  And, again, another figure, hearkening back to 90 percent of the American people want commonsense universal background checks.  The statistics spell out the stories, but it is the human personal stories that change minds.  How moving it was to hear our colleague, Congresswoman McBath, with her generosity of spirit tell her personal story of losing her son, Jordan--I can't even imagine carrying that burden--but turning her grief and her tragedy into action and courage to run for Congress, to stand on this floor and share her personal story with us. That takes real courage.  Let's hope that we all have the courage to save children's lives, everyone's lives in our country whose deaths can be avoided.  There is no person in this body whose political survival is more important than the survival of our children.  We are grateful, again, to the young people, parents, survivors across America who have told their stories, marched for their lives, and demanded change. This bill delivers that change, ensuring that people who are a danger to themselves and others cannot purchase a gun and perpetuate violence in our communities.  This week, the House will build on this progress by passing another bipartisan background check bill. We must close the Charleston loophole that enabled the horrific hate crime at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.  We salute the majority whip, Mr. Clyburn, for his leadership on H.R. 1112.  Tomorrow, we will vote on that. That is another part of strengthening the background check provisions.  As Members of Congress, again, we take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution, the American people. To honor that oath, to honor the victims of gun violence and their families, Congress must take real action on this floor. Today, we must pass this bill and take the first steps toward ending the senseless crisis of gun violence in our Nation.  Again, I hope that all of us will have the courage to save lives, remembering that no one's political survival here is more important than the survival of the American people--especially our children.  I urge a strong bipartisan ``yes'' vote and pray that we can do the right thing and send a clear message to the families of those who have lost their loved ones to gun violence, that we have crossed a threshold here today to reduce gun violence in our country and take more steps to improve the safety of the American people, honoring the Constitution of the United States, respectful of our hunters and the need for people to defend themselves, but doing so in a way that does not endanger others."

And what has it led us to? With some of the strictest gun control laws in the land, we have some of the worst incidents of gun violence in the country.  Gun control measures do not address the problems of gun violence, and this bill will not address gun violence.  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 8. The legislation is an attempt to take away our Second Amendment rights, hidden under the guise that we will see a reduction in violent crime.  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim the bill would save lives, but nothing in this bill would have stopped any of the recent mass casualty shootings that have occurred in our country. The only thing this bill does is limit the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens.  They will tell you this bill closes loopholes; however, the loophole that they believe exists is private gun ownership, and what they really want is to regulate the private transfer of firearms. If my neighbor is in trouble and needs to borrow a firearm to protect his family, I should be allowed to loan that firearm to my neighbor so that he can protect himself and his family.  This is not something we should need to go to the Federal Government to get permission to do. The Second Amendment does not say that, after you get permission from the government, your right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Our Founding Fathers wrote the Constitution to protect us from the government and gave individuals the Second Amendment to protect themselves.  I carry this Constitution every day on the campaign trail asphalt. I carry it with me every day now to remind myself of those protections that were given to us--not by government, but by God.  This bill is nothing more than an attempt to advance the agenda of radical gun-grabbers and lay the foundation for a national gun registration scheme. Mr. Chair, I urge the House to reject this misguided legislation so we can begin having real discussions about ways to reduce crime across this great Nation."

But our work is not done. In Houston alone, we see an average of 550 acts of gun violence per year.  Too many of our loved ones are lost to senseless gun violence that could be prevented by keeping firearms out of dangerous hands. We know expanded background checks work.  States requiring background checks on all handgun sales see half as many mass shootings as States without the expanded requirements. That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 8. This commonsense bill will prevent private firearm sales to prohibit purchasers and close online and gun show loopholes.  While this bill does not cover everything, it is a step in the right direction that will make my district--Houston, Texas--and this country safer."

                    "speech":"Mr. Chair, my name is Pete Stauber, and I was a law enforcement officer for 23 years in the great State of Minnesota, the city of Duluth.  In December of 1995, at 10:32 p.m., at the intersection of 6th Avenue East and 4th Street in Duluth, Minnesota, a criminal who should not have had a firearm tried to take my life. I was shot in the head, and by the grace of God, I survived.  A few years after that, while on duty in a hostage situation, another criminal pulled a gun on me. Face-to-face, I was staring down the barrel of a handgun. The suspect pulled the trigger. The gun malfunctioned, and I was in a fight for my life. When it was all over, by the grace of God, I was alive. The individual was handcuffed.  Both those individuals were career criminals.  Back to when I was shot in the head, Mr. Chair: I begged the U.S. attorney, along with our police department, to charge the individual with possession of a handgun by a felon. They didn't do it. That individual was allowed to circumvent our community for another 8 years before he was finally put in prison, where he belonged. No more harming other people.  Representative Collins' Mass Violence Prevention Act gets the county attorneys and our Federal attorneys present to prosecute these individuals who have no respect for life.  I carried a handgun for 23 years, Mr. Chair, as a tool to defend my life or somebody else's life from great bodily harm. I support the individual right of law-abiding citizens, the right to keep and bear arms.  Both my wife and I live in rural Minnesota. When we need to protect ourselves, when it takes awhile for law enforcement to get there, we have the ability.  There is nobody I know who wants somebody who is going through a mental health issue or a career criminal or a drug dealer to have these.  We need to start respecting life. Life is precious, from conception to natural death. I am a very proud husband of an Iraq war veteran who understands the value of life.  Mr. Chair, I rise against this. There are better ways to get mothers and fathers, county attorneys, Federal prosecutors, local police departments, and sheriff departments to work together to have a fusion center so, when a young individual types into a computer ``I want to be a mass school shooter,'' there is an instant response to identify the individual and work through it."

Now is that time. We have waited too long to close loopholes that let people easily avoid background checks through private sales. I have cried with too many survivors and attended too many funerals. I have marched with too many student activists, and I have bowed my head through too many moments of silence.  We know strong gun laws work. In the 25 years since the Brady law took effect, background checks have stopped more than $3 million in gun sales and have saved countless lives.  It is time to expand the Brady law. It is time to close the dangerous loopholes. It is past time for Congress to take action to save lives from gun violence.  Mr. Chair, this is not a moment of silence. This is not a sit-in.

In Nebraska, the need for firearms is the same today as it was even when the Second Amendment was enacted before we were even a territory of the United States.  Rural Nebraskans depend on their firearms for self-defense and for protecting their livestock. They also know how to handle firearms, to store them securely, to handle them appropriately, and perhaps to even let neighbors who are able to use them safely borrow them to meet their needs.  I have serious concerns. The bills we are considering today and tomorrow are going to criminalize this behavior for Nebraskans who have done this for generations and won't even know that they are breaking the law.  Should a rancher who lends a rifle to a neighbor to address threats from predatory animals face a year in prison and a $100,000 fine? No.  Should a legally carrying farmer who is injured at work be subject to arrest for handing his firearm off before being taken to the hospital? No.  These are exactly the situations this bill would create, while doing little to address the real problems underlying crime in our society.

                    "speech":"Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman, and I certainly thank the ranking member for being present here today. I hold up in my hand pages and pages of mass shootings, which I will include in the Record. Mr. Chair, I thank Moms Demand Action, and I thank all those who have offered themselves in this fight. I thank our chair, Mr. Thompson, for his constant and persistent work.  Through my tenure as ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee, and now third in seniority on the Judiciary Committee, it has given me a picture that many have not seen, and that is that we have been fighting for gun safety legislation for almost three decades.  It seems that even though Mr. Cohen is in a hearing right now where facts are being disputed, there are no facts to dispute the fact that people die from guns. And those who get guns are never regulated.  By no means do I want you not to have a handgun to protect yourself, or to enforce gun trafficking laws, or to make sure that prosecutors prosecute those for gun possession, but it begs the question. What is the question? The interpretation of the Second Amendment is no one should prohibit the right to bear arms. As I stand here today, there is nothing in the underlying bill that is prohibiting that.  It is simply common sense and giving dignity to those who died at the Columbine High School shooting, the Atlanta shooting, the Wedgwood Baptist Church shooting, the Lockheed Martin shooting, the Living Church of God shooting, the Red Lake High School shooting, the Northern Illinois University shooting, the Santa Fe shooting in Texas, the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, and the Sutherland Springs church shooting in Texas.  It says that you have to have a check, a background check. It closes the gun show loophole. It gives exemptions for the issues of domestic violence and sexual assault. It allows families to transfer, and ranchers, farmers, and fishers to transfer.  My God, what more do we want? People have died. Are we not going to show that we are committed to saving lives, not to abuse the Second Amendment, to misuse it? We can bear arms. But the question is whether or not we will recognize that there are 350-plus million Americans, and there are more guns in this country than there are citizens.  I beg of my colleagues: Stop the violence. Vote for this bill.  Mr. Chair, as a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and an original co-sponsor, I rise in strong of H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that strengthens the background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.  A 2013 study found that approximately 80 percent of all firearms acquired for criminal purposes were obtained from sources who were not required to run a background check and that 96 percent of inmates who were not prohibited from possessing a firearm at the time they committed their crime obtained their gun this way.  This loophole exists largely because unlicensed sellers need not conduct any background check under current law, even if the sellers sell a large number of guns.  H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would make it illegal for any person who is not a licensed firearm importer, manufacturer, or dealer to transfer a firearm to any other person who is not so licensed without a background check.  Individuals seeking to transfer a firearm under this measure would be required to visit a licensed firearms dealer to run the necessary background check before the transfer could be finalized.  H.R. 8 is intended to provide an accurate and speedy means of ensuring firearms do not end up in the wrong hands.  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of investigation (FBI) demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within 90 seconds.  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more than 2015.  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and violence deterrence.  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United States--355 mass shootings in 2015.  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.  On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--as much as 114 percent higher than other states.  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.  Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.  This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the solution.  Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.  We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.  We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite plague across the nation.  My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement after four of his officers were shot while on duty.  He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun violence.  Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.  That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of addressing the epidemic. Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least one life, then it is worth it.  I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague, Congressman Mike Thompson, for his leadership of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force and for introducing this timely and important legislation.  Congressman Thompson sat in the audience during the entirety of the Gun Safety Hearing on February 13, 2019, demonstrating his longstanding commitment to the issue.  Also helping to bring us to this point today is Congresswoman Robin Kelly of Illinois, who represents one of the most affected districts when it comes to gun violence.  She is a valiant leader who will not rest until the Congress finds solutions for communities like hers and others all over this country.  I want to thank Aalayah Eastmond, a survivor from the Parkland School Shooting, for testifying as a witness at the House Judiciary Gun Safety Hearing.  Her heartfelt and vivid testimony was met with a standing ovation by the crowded audience in the hearing.  Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.  Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to address a public-health epidemic?''  I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''  We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority members.  We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.  And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President and the gun lobby.  I am a defender and supporter of the Constitution.  I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our citizens.  However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest divine right of all.  I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and law enforcement officials.  Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to undergo ``active shooter'' drills.  Imagine having children in grade school today.  Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or AR-15.  Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.  We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to pass H.R. 8, the ``Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019.''"

What it simply does is require that all sales of firearms go through a licensed firearms dealer who has to run a background check. Current law mandates that all licensed gun dealers, before transferring a weapon, have to perform a background check.  The problem we have in this country is the law allows unlicensed firearms dealers competing with licensed firearms dealers to sell just as many firearms as a licensed gun dealer, but without doing the background check. That enables criminals and people who should not have weapons to have firearms, and that contributes to the proliferation of weaponry on our streets in the hands of those who should not have them.  It produces violence, and we are looking to stop the violence with this legislation, and so I ask my colleagues to support it."

If our States like Nevada and Arizona have low restrictions when it comes to purchasing a firearm, we are only as safe as they are.

Gun violence is a crisis in our communities and a real national emergency that will no longer be met with inaction.  For the first time since Congress passed the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1994, we will pass a bill in pursuit of our effort to protect our communities and end this scourge of gun violence.

Four people were killed and two were injured in six different shootings. One person was 28. The other five were 16, 17, and 18. They were teenagers. My heart goes out to all of those victims' families.  Thoughts and prayers are no longer enough. It is long past time that our actions speak louder than our words. No matter which State we are from, with over 40,000 gun violence deaths last year, every State has been severely impacted by gun violence.  The public health crisis has been politicized and weaponized as a means to divide us, despite the fact that it is a crisis that should bind us together, and we must come together. Background checks are the foundation of commonsense gun policy, and they are supported by the overwhelming majority of Americans. Our current system fails us in two ways, but the bills we are looking at this week are designed to address that.  Under current law, firearm sales can proceed regardless if a good background check comes back within a 3-day period, and it doesn't capture all the sales. So this puts an incredible burden on law enforcement and an incredible burden on ATF agents who have to go and reclaim guns that are sold, despite the owner of the gun not being able to pass the background check. So for too long those in a position to act have failed to do so. But that ends now.  I strongly support the commonsense gun legislation in H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112."

We have risen on this floor time after time after time after time and had a moment of silence followed by no action.  As I said time after time, we have had a moment of silence. I will tell my friend from Georgia that it hasn't worked. It has been appropriate, but it has not worked.  Can we guarantee that this will work to make every person safe?  It cannot. It will not. But I rise in strong support of doing something, and in this case doing something that 90 percent of America supports.  Mr. Chairman, this House is finally going to do its job and take action--not just a moment of silence, but action--to address the epidemic of gun violence in our country.  After the tragedies at Sandy Hook, Orlando, Las Vegas, Charleston, the Tree of Life synagogue, and Great Mills High School in my district, the House, under the previous leadership, did nothing. It didn't work.  After the shooting just down the street at the Washington Navy Yard, the Republican-controlled House did nothing. Three of the victims of that attack were constituents of mine living in southern Maryland. Dr. Wendy Edmonds and Wanda Wallace are in the gallery, Mr. Chairman. They are the sisters of Sylvia Fraser, a Navy Yard shooting victim.  Montana Geimer, daughter of Wendi Winters, a writer for the Capital Gazette of which my colleague, Mr. Brown, just spoke; and Mackenzie Boughey, a high school student who organized a March for Our Lives rally in Anne Arundel County, are here with us today not to have a moment of silence, but to have a moment of action.  Many of our districts have been painfully affected by gun violence. In St. Mary's County in Maryland, as I told you, Mr. Chairman, a student was killed by a shooter at Great Mills High School, and a courageous school resources officer there saved countless other lives. In Annapolis, five staff members of the Capital Gazette were gunned down in their newsroom.  For years, the American people have demanded action to address gun violence. After the Parkland shooting, just over a year ago, students marched in cities from coast to coast to demand that Congress protect them in the classroom, in the streets, in houses of worship, and in all public gathering places.  I, as I am sure many of you have, had the opportunity to meet with many of the students who participated in the March for Our Lives and heard the determination in their voices as they spoke about working to achieve a future where students would no longer have to practice active-shooter drills in their schools. I found their courage and persistence deeply inspiring.  Now, with a change in the majority control, we are bringing to the floor legislation supported by, as I said, nine out of ten Americans, including a majority of responsible gun owners to expand criminal background checks to make sure that those who have a criminal past, a past of violence--domestic or otherwise--a mental health problem, or are on the no-fly list because they are perceived as possibly terrorists, won't be able to buy a gun.  Does that mean they won't get a gun?  It does not. I understand that. But as I told my friend from Georgia, the moments of silence have not worked. They were appropriate, I understand, but they didn't work. We will also be voting this week on legislation offered by our whip, Mr. Clyburn, to close the loophole that contributed to the horrific mass shooting at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston in 2015.  Mr. Chairman, I urge the Senate to follow the House and pass the legislation we advance, and I call on the President to sign it without delay.  Mr. Chairman, let us not have a moment of silence for this legislation. Do not let it die. Do not let the hope that it provides die. Do not let us stand by one more time to lament the death of a constituent, a friend, a neighbor, a fellow citizen, who dies at the hand of a gun purchased illegally or by someone who should not have a gun.  This is not about taking away guns. It is about preventing guns getting in the hands of people who do bad things, and we can predict that they are a danger to others. Let us not have a moment of silence for this bill. Let us pass it. Let the Senate pass it. Let the President sign it. Let's make an effort at least to stop the carnage."

Let's look at what these bills would actually do. We had identified any number of problems with this bill that we were trying to improve, and every one of those was shut out, shut out by the Democratic majority who wanted to try to stifle the opposing side's debate because they think just saying background checks makes this a good bill.  Let's talk about what this bill will do to make criminals--felons--out of law-abiding citizens. If you loan your gun to a friend under this bill, maybe they are thinking of buying a similar gun to protect themselves and they want to go to a shooting range to see if this gun is the right kind of gun to protect themselves with, which they have a right to do under the Second Amendment of this Constitution, loaning your gun to that friend in that act would make you a felon subject to a year in jail and subject to a $100,000 fine, Mr. Chairman.  We tried to fix that. They shut that amendment out.  In this bill, if you loan your gun to a friend who maybe has been a victim of domestic violence--and one of my colleagues who is here in opposition to this bill is one of those victims of domestic violence. She had an amendment to fix this bill to say, if she has got a temporary restraining order against her boyfriend who has been beating her and she is afraid he is going to come back tonight, under one of the bills, if she goes to buy a gun tonight and the Fix NICS system isn't working, she may have 20 business days to get that gun.  Now, good luck if the boyfriend shows up to beat her up that night and she says: Don't worry, I am on day 8. I only have another 12 days before I can buy the gun. Will you come back so I can defend myself then?  Do you really think that is going to happen?  You know what that means to her.  So in the bill we said: What if you can loan your gun to her?  She goes to a friend and says: I know you have a gun. I don't have a gun. I am trying to protect myself because I have got a TRO, but I know he is probably going to come back.  Under this bill, you will be a felon, a year in jail, $100,000 fine. We tried to fix that, too, Mr. Chairman, and they shut that amendment out. That is what this bill does.  Oh, by the way, we are talking about law-abiding citizens here. If you go hunting with a buddy and you try to loan your gun to a buddy, Mr. Chairman, they say there is an exemption in the bill. But it is written so vaguely that you not only need to bring your hunting partner, you might need to bring your attorney to find out if loaning your shotgun to your friend makes you a felon under this bill.  These are law-abiding citizens. These are people who use guns to defend themselves, which is the basis of the Second Amendment. Our Founding Fathers believed every American has the right to defend themselves, because every day, on average, in this country guns are used by good people to defend themselves against bad people, and it is going to make it harder for them to get access to these guns to defend themselves. So, again, we tried to fix some of these problems.  Mr. Chairman, let me tell you about another problem we tried to identify and fix. If you loan your gun, you will be a felon."

But then we identified another problem. If someone who is in this country illegally goes to buy a gun and the system flags them, and it says: Wait a minute, this person is not even here legally. They are breaking Federal law trying to buy a gun. We said that we should notify ICE so at least our Border Patrol agents in the interior can deport them. They blocked that amendment.  So now a law-abiding citizen can become a felon under their bill, but someone who is here illegally trying to buy a gun in violation of the law can't be turned over to authorities. This is a bad gun control bill, and we ought to reject it."

I was asked to talk about some of the outrageous allegations that were made about this bill, and the chairman already cleared one up, and that is the $100,000 fine that we are hearing from the other side. It is $1,000, as was pointed out.  We also heard that this isn't constitutional. Well, the Constitution is pretty clear: Individuals have a right to bear arms. Nobody is disputing that. As a matter of fact, it was settled in District of Columbia v. Heller.  But also in that opinion were Justice Scalia's remarks that stated that government also has a responsibility and a right to regulate firearms. That is all we are doing.  We are saying that people who are felons, domestic abusers, dangerously mentally ill, a danger to themselves or others shouldn't be able to have guns. I don't think anybody can dispute that. And how do you find out if you don't do a background check?  My friends on the other side of the aisle said this won't work. We have heard it a hundred times: This won't work. Well, we have been working on this for 6 and a half years, ever since Sandy Hook. We have pleaded with the other side to work with us, have a hearing.  What are your ideas?  Absolute silence from them. Absolute silence.  This does work. We know that licensed dealers stop the sale of firearms to 170 felons every day and 50 domestic abusers every day because they are required to do background checks.  But in some States, that same individual can be found to be prohibited, walk outside and go to a gun show or go online and buy a gun without the benefit of a background check--and that is wrong.  Countless speakers from the other side of the aisle said this wouldn't have stopped this crime, this wouldn't have stopped this mass shooting, this wouldn't have stopped that mass shooting. Well, my friends, if that is your standard, if you will only support a bill that will stop every mass shooting, that will stop every death by a firearm, that means you want to get rid of all guns, and no one on this side of the aisle is saying that."

Before I do, I think it is important to acknowledge how polarizing this debate has become over the last several years. More specifically, I want this body to know that, as a human being, as an American, as a father, when I see the heartbreaking news of a mass shooting like the one we saw just 54 weeks ago in Parkland, it just breaks my heart.  With that being said, this bill that we are voting on today would not have done anything to stop that tragedy from happening, nor would it have prevented any of those recent mass shootings.  The 19-year-old murderer in Parkland passed a background check.  The man who murdered 26 innocent people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs also passed a background check, although he wouldn't have if the Air Force had passed along his criminal information like they were supposed to have done.  And the evil that took place in Sandy Hook wouldn't have been stopped by this bill either. The killer used his mother's guns to kill her and 26 others. They were bought legally.  Mr. Chairman, the simple fact is that criminals don't abide by the law, and this would only create traps for law-abiding gun owners.  However, there are actions that we can take, actions that we can do, that would make meaningful strides in combating the violence that we see today.  One example of something we could do, improve information sharing between law enforcement officials across this country.  Mr. Chair, to close, I disagree with the policy of this bill."

It doesn't negate the fact that too many people who shouldn't have guns, who are mentally unstable, who have committed crimes, and who are abusers get guns because they buy a gun at a gun show or not from a registered gun dealer and, therefore, do not have to undergo a background check.  Everyone who gets a gun should have to undergo a background check, with the few exceptions we put in the bill.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 8 is legislation that is long overdue for passage by this body and for enactment so that we can take a critical step overwhelmingly supported by the American people to protect us from gun violence.  We have had too many moments of silence, too many expressions of sympathy, too many deaths--39,000 deaths from guns last year--but little action here in Congress on this issue.  Today we act.

Twenty-five years later--and 300 million background checks that have blocked 3 million purchases to dangerous individuals--few if any today seriously suggest that the Brady law should be repealed.  I support the Second Amendment. Universal background checks prescribed in H.R. 8 are an attempt to ensure that firearms are procured, owned and used by responsible, law abiding citizens.  According to the Brady Campaign, about 1 in 5 guns now sold in America are done so without a background check. That's a significant loophole.  According to the CDC, there was a record 39,773 deaths from firearms in 2017--higher than in any other year--23,854 were self-inflicted and 14,542 were homicides.  To mitigate gun violence in America, H.R. 8 expands Brady background checks to transactions by private sellers not currently covered by the law.  Multiple school shootings have led to robust, comprehensive action at every level to make classrooms safer. I have visited many schools in my district--and I have found that while the threat is being taken seriously, no one policy, program or initiative can ensure the level of protection our students need and deserve.  Mr. Chair, no constitutional right is absolute including the Second Amendment. The First Amendment's freedom of speech, for example, has reasonable limits including the promulgation of slander and libel law.  To preserve public order, we accept reasonable restrictions on the freedom to assemble. Even freedom of religion isn't without some modest boundaries.  In like manner, universal background checks don't erode Second Amendment rights but do help ensure much needed protection from gun violence for everyone."

This common sense bipartisan legislation would expand the current firearm background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales nationwide.  Our nation is currently enduring a crisis that is putting families and communities at risk. Gun violence has become so commonplace in our society that we no longer seem to flinch whenever these events occur. Gun violence threatens national security and inflicts a toll. 125,000 people are shot every year and more than 36,000 people die as a result of these shootings. A 2018 report conducted by the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention revealed that there were 3,353 firearm-related deaths in my home state of Texas. 352 of these were children and teenagers under 19 years old. Texas unfortunately has played host to some of the most viscous recent mass shootings, such as the 2009 Fort Hood shooting, the Dallas police officer shooting in 2016, the Plano and Sutherland Springs Church shootings in 2017, and last year's Santa Fe High School shooting.  We have high levels of gun violence in this country because we have weak laws that are riddled with loopholes. This bill will not only eliminate those loopholes, but it will do so without infringing upon second amendment rights. Implementing universal background checks is supported by 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun owners.

TSA PreCheck identifies trusted travelers and, thus, allows expedited movement through airport security. In order to receive TSA PreCheck, one must submit an application, have an in-person interview, and go through a background check and fingerprinting. Fingerprinting is not required, currently, to purchase a gun; thus, a TSA PreCheck background check is more stringent. If an individual can pass this background check and be admitted to this Federal Government program, there is no reason why they shouldn't be able to borrow a firearm from a friend. They have already gone through a more extensive background check system than to acquire a weapon. The current background check does not require fingerprints; a TSA PreCheck does.  Membership to TSA PreCheck must be renewed every 5 years. Again, the TSA PreCheck process requires fingerprints and an in-person interview. The process, currently, for purchasing a gun requires neither of those under Federal law. It appears, then, that the TSA PreCheck process is a more extensive process.  H.R. 8 restricts not only the purchase, but also the everyday gun transfer for law-abiding citizens. This amendment and many other Republican amendments--I think I had five others that were not made in order--seek to give some relief to law-abiding citizens from this overarching and burdensome legislation.  In H.R. 8, we are not only talking about the purchase of firearms, we are talking about the transfer of firearms, which includes lending your firearm. The Democrats have proposed a bill that would criminalize millions of law-abiding Americans. Because this bill uses ambiguous, overarching, and vague language, it encompasses so many potential situations. This amendment seeks to give some relief.  If we are going to allow Americans to be given expedited and reduced screening in our most sensitive and secure environments in the U.S. airport getting on a plane, why wouldn't we allow them to lend a gun to their friend?  H.R. 8 criminalizes me and others just for handing someone a firearm who isn't a direct family member or in other very narrow situations. In fact, as I said yesterday, the language in this bill is so ambiguous. What is ``imminent danger''? There is no definition in the bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time."

                    "speech":"Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment because it is fatally flawed and would undermine the public safety impact of the bill.  The amendment would add an exception to the background check requirement for anyone who is a participant in the TSA PreCheck program by the Department of Homeland Security.  By exempting those who have obtained a TSA PreCheck from the background check requirement, the amendment would allow many dangerous people, including people with disqualifying mental health conditions and some criminal convictions, to obtain firearms without a background check.  The current background system, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, was designed specifically for background checks pursuant to the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.  The system, often called the NICS, contains the information that no other Federal database contains, and the TSA does not check NICS when determining a person's eligibility for the TSA PreCheck program.  Although participants in the TSA PreCheck program have had their criminal backgrounds vetted, the standards for approval and participation in the TSA PreCheck program are not the same and, in many cases, are more lenient than those which prohibit firearm possession and purchase.  For example, the NICS searches the records of people prohibited for mental health reasons during a firearms background check. These mental health reasons, though, are not part of the TSA PreCheck search.  As of January 31, there are more than 5.7 million of these mental health records in the NICS indexes, making it the second most populous category of prohibited records for firearm purchase.  Because the Department of Homeland Security does not have access to these mental health records for TSA PreCheck program purposes, individuals who have been adjudicated to be disqualified to own firearms for reasons of mental condition or have been committed to any mental institution may be accepted under the TSA PreCheck program but are not legally able to possess a gun. Under this amendment, they would be legally exempted from the background check requirement and would be able to get a gun, despite being legally prohibited from doing so.  The TSA bars people convicted of certain criminal offenses, such as rape or aggravated sexual abuse, from participating in the TSA PreCheck program only temporarily. It doesn't restrict people convicted of these serious crimes for more than 7 years, and it wouldn't bar people released from prison for these crimes within the last 5 years.  Under current law, these felony convictions prohibit possession or purchase of a weapon, but, under this amendment, people released from prison within the last 5 years for these crimes could get the weapons--could get the weapons.  The TSA PreCheck program does not have a minimum age requirement, and this amendment would allow people under the ages of 18 and 21 to purchase firearms illegally and without a NICS background check.  Furthermore, the TSA PreCheck program only requires a background check every 5 years, and the PreCheck system may not be advised that a firearms disqualifying offense has taken place after the initial PreCheck background check has occurred.  In other words, you get the TSA PreCheck, and if you are convicted afterwards, within 5 years, for a very serious crime, under this amendment, you could get the gun, although, legally, you shouldn't without a background check, and the TSA PreCheck program would not have picked it up. These shortcomings of the TSA PreCheck system make it an inadequate and dangerous substitute for a NICS background check. To prevent potentially prohibited purchasers from obtaining firearms, licensed dealers should conduct background checks on participants in the PreCheck program as they would with any other member of the public.  The blanket exception of this amendment for anyone who participates in the TSA PreCheck program would undermine the bill's ability to enhance public safety because it would enable people convicted of serious crimes, people adjudicated to have serious mental illnesses, to purchase guns without a background check, even though the TSA system would not pick them up.  The TSA system is not a substitute for the background check system. It doesn't pick up many of the crimes. It doesn't carry it forward. And it is not a substitute for this system.  To pass this amendment, which would allow people who have qualified under the TSA PreCheck program not to have background checks, would allow a lot of people who shouldn't have guns to have them. Therefore, I strongly oppose this amendment, and I ask that my colleagues vote ``no'' on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time."

Again, it requires a fingerprint background check and an individual interview. Neither of those are required right now.

                    "speech":"Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019. My amendment clarifies that those at risk of committing suicide would be exempt from the background check requirement in instances of imminent threats of death or great bodily harm.  Specifically, this legislation amends the bill to insert the line ``including harm to self, family, household members, or others'' to the list of instances when a person is exempt from the background check requirement and may temporarily transfer away a firearm for safekeeping.  The spirit of this long overdue legislation is to save lives, and I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, which will further achieve this goal by addressing the leading instance of gun death in this country, suicide.  Last year, nearly 40,000 people were killed by gun violence, with another 80,000 literally caught in the crossfire. Of those killed, over half, more than 20,000, people tragically died by gun suicide.  And the problem has grown. Nationally, over the past years, the past decade, the rate of suicide by gun death has increased 19 percent. This is a problem that grips our entire Nation.  In my home State of Pennsylvania, there has been a 24 percent increase in gun suicides over the past 10 years, claiming the lives of over 14,000 people. These are our friends, our loved ones, young and old, people for whom our hearts ache, people we wish we could hold just one more time.  I offer up a picture of a dear friend of my family, Ron.  Unfortunately, very few of us are left unscathed by this problem. While there are many factors that contribute to self-harm, the presence of a firearm in the home increases the risk of suicide. Not surprisingly, using a gun is the method that most often ends in death.  Guns are dangerously effective at what they are designed to do. That is why this amendment is so important. It ensures that those in crisis can temporarily transfer a firearm safely until the crisis has passed. It clearly defines that a person can temporarily hand over firearms to someone they trust while they work through this difficult time.  This clarity is needed because, in times of crisis, moments matter. It may literally be the difference between life and death.  We are here today at a historic moment to take action against the violence that plagues this country, our communities, and our loved ones. The Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019, with this amendment, will keep guns out of the hands of those who legally should not have them and also gives those who need a safe way to separate themselves from their guns a way to do so.  If we have the courage to pass this legislation, the courage here in the House and in the Senate and in the White House, it will do just that. It will save lives.

                    "speech":"Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the willingness of the amendment, I think, but I rise in that, again, this is something discussed at committee. It was an attempt to--it is basically a failed attempt to fix one of the shortcomings of this legislation.  I understand why they would bring it. I understand why they would want to fix it, because its existence indicates what we have been saying about the flaws in the bill, which we discussed at committee.  Like other floor amendments that are going to be offered, this is nothing more than trying to basically change the appearance of what is a flawed perception. The problem here is it addresses the undefined term of ``imminent'' used in the bill.  Mr. Chairman, it is well known, and I have spoken about it many times, that I am still currently serving as a United States Air Force chaplain. I have pastored for many years, and I have been on the other end of phone calls from those who were struggling and thinking of taking their life.  Suicide is not something that we can define very easily. It is not something that we can simply limit to: Yes, guns are effective. But any method that someone uses to choose to end their life is sad and a struggle for those of us who have dealt with this.  The term ``imminent'' here is problematic for those of us who have dealt with those who are struggling with suicide because imminent to them and imminent to a judge and imminent to someone who wants to take his life, and to law enforcement, indicates something precipitous that will happen in a very short amount of time, a very imminent act, something that is maybe going to happen, Mr. Chairman, even before I finish my speech. That is an imminent kind of act.  Imminent does not extend to 12 hours or 24 hours or even 46 hours. That would not fall under the definition of ``imminent.'' And I am not willing to let a prosecutor or a judge who may not like guns, who would actually say that was an imminent threat, and by transferring it for more than a short amount of time, you have then fallen under and fall under this.  Now, I would hope that would never happen, Mr. Chairman. But we have to be serious about this issue of imminence. For those of us who have dealt with this, there may be, and I have had times when people would come to me and they were thinking about harming themselves, but the imminence factor was not there. They were just trying to see if they could clear their head. It may be a week that would pass, and they came back and would say it was fine.  But in this issue, I understand the intent and the heart here, but it is a very weak attempt to fix problems that we had already pointed out in this bill. And it will still not fix the problem, because the problem is the imminent standard. That is the part that we are struggling with.  We can disagree about this, and I will respect the gentlewoman if she disagrees, and would expect her to. But let's remember, this is carried out, if, say--which I would hope would not happen--this bill actually becomes law. It then will present a problem for those who have to enforce it and those judges who would have to interpret it.  We have to remember that our actions here, we vote on words on paper, not aspirational ideas. Those are happy thoughts, not words on paper. The only thing that the courts can do is vote on words on paper.  I appreciate the gentlewoman bringing this. I support the intent, especially dealing with suicide, which many of us have worked on, and the tragedy that it leaves in the wake of so many. But please understand my opposition to this is it is still a flawed product because we have not dealt with the very issue of imminence in this legislation and this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time."

The amendment makes clear that the limited number of exemptions to the background check requirement include circumstances in which someone feels that they are a danger to themselves. They may temporarily transfer a firearm until the danger has passed. This is a limited and reasonable exemption that only applies to those who fear they will harm themselves, so that they may temporary surrender their weapon.  I listened to the gentleman from Georgia, and I appreciate he doesn't think that the amendment goes far enough or solves the underlying problems of the bill, as he sees it.

                    "speech":"Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 8 is a critical piece of legislation that I am proud to support. Congress needs to act to cut down on our Nation's widespread gun violence. We must close loopholes that give buyers and sellers a way around background checks. There is no reason vendors at gun shows or online should be exempt from the safety measures other merchants must obey. We should also vet sales between two people.  That is not to say that there should be no exceptions. My amendment carves out protections for people who face risk of domestic violence, dating partner violence, sexual assault, stalking, and domestic abuse.  The underlying bill, H.R. 8, already creates an exception to the background check requirement when there is a temporary weapon transfer, if the transferee is at imminent risk of death or great bodily harm. Our amendment is meant to make it crystal clear and explicit that this exception applies when the transferees are protecting themselves from an abuser. It does not expand the underlying exception; it offers one critical example of where it might apply. When I talked to Oklahomans across my district last year, they confided in me their concerns about gun violence. I promised to work towards policies that would protect them.  We need to protect our Second Amendment right, but there is no credible reason why we as a state and nation can't acknowledge there are steps we can take to save lives and find a path forward to do so.  H.R. 8 does just that. It increases safety without limiting our Second Amendment rights by implementing commonsense policy.  But when we take these commonsense steps, we need to acknowledge our power to create unintended consequences, and to prevent them.  That is why I am offering this amendment. In addition to my commitment to gun safety, I have talked about my devotion to helping protect women and families.  Between 1998 and 2017, the Oklahoma Domestic Violence Fatality Review Board found nearly 1,700 people were killed in our State because of domestic violence. In 2017 alone, 91 Oklahomans were murdered.  The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that nearly two in five Oklahoma women will face some form of domestic abuse or sexual violence during their lifetimes.  Oklahoma is consistently ranked in the top five States for women killed by men in one-on-one homicides.  Oklahoma domestic violence programs serve an average of 18,000 people annually, according to the YWCA.  Oklahoma is not an exception. These problems persist. One in four women and one in nine men experience intimate partner physical violence; these people deserve to be protected.  For us, that means many things, including strengthening and reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and investing in support services and family justice centers. But it also means we need to empower people to protect themselves.  That is why Congress should pass laws to strengthen background checks and create exceptions for those who truly need them.

When debate is cut short in committee, this is what happens.  They realize that good products were brought up, but yet they chose to push through a bill because they had a timeline.  We went through this in the Rules Committee. I get it. This is what is coming up. But, again, to put this in, ``great bodily harm,'' it is minimally helpful at this point. It goes back to the problem we had with ``imminent'' in the last one.  These are all things, frankly, that could have been--even in a bill that I would disagree with at the end of the day on this--this is, again, not something that is going to fix it. A victim of domestic abuse can live in constant fear of her abuser and feel threatened at all times.  Again, Mr. Chairman, I understand at least the attempt to fix something, because they understand that there were problems and they don't want to make it worse, but I have advocated all along that what this does help, it also hurts. And this is, again, just another attempt to do that.

In our effort to ensure the safety of our communities, however, we can't forget the needs of those at risk of domestic violence to protect themselves from abuse.  According to the Kansas Bureau of Investigation, in 2017 a domestic violence incident was reported every 23 minutes and a domestic violence murder occurred every 9 days in the State of Kansas.  In the United States, more than 12 million people experience some form of domestic violence by a current or former domestic partner every year.

The parents of one of my closest friends are technically stepparents, but you would never know it, because they are all so close and love each other so much.  The amendment also clarifies that gifts and loans of firearms among family members are still subject to the existing legal standard for all transfers.  Existing law states that no person may deliver a firearm to someone if he or she has a reason to believe that the person is prohibited from possessing a firearm.  Consequently, even gifts and loans among family members are not permissible if the transferor has a reason to believe that the transferee may use the firearm in a crime or is prohibited from possessing firearms.

It fixes one of the many flaws in the bill.  Again, Republicans had solutions to these loose ends all over the bill, but our debate time was stopped. But I do have just a question here. Although I am not opposing this amendment, it merely adds the exchange between stepparent and their stepchildren.  What about stepsiblings who also love each other dearly? But this doesn't include that. Stepgrandparents and stepgrandchildren? What about foster families or adoptive families?  It is a simple fix that, again, goes forward and, again, struggles.  But I do want to go back and address something, Mr. Chairman, that came up earlier, and it seemed to get an interesting response from my friends across the aisle, my colleague stated that the appropriate fine is $1,000, not $100,000. They cite the U.S. sentencing guidelines for this number, but I do have to remind the chairman that since the Booker decision, of course, the guidelines are only advisory. And we need not look to the advisory guidelines, but look at the statute the bill amends.  Remember, we do not vote on aspirations in this Chamber; we vote on words on paper.  18 USC 924(a)(5) contains the penalty for violating part ``(s) or (t) of section 922 shall be fined under this title, imprisoned for not more than 1 year, or both.''  18 USC 3571(b)(5) ``for a Class A misdemeanor'', which this is, ``that does not result in death, not more than $100,000.''  So it could be $1,000 or it could be up to $100,000.  I appreciate our confusion over this issue, but unfortunately, as I stated before, this is what happens when a bill is rushed to the floor, and it is why we oppose this legislation.  When we understand this, Mr. Chairman, again, you can offer amendments that make Members feel good, but feeling good doesn't heal you and feeling good will not make this better.  I will not oppose this amendment, but, again, I think in just the moments that I have had here, I raised enough questions about this amendment to take up those very issues that were spoken of about the love between stepparents and stepchildren. What about the stepsiblings? What about the stepgrandparents? That is still part of that device and not addressed in this.  And, again, going back to the issue of the fine: again, the statute and the bill itself are pretty clear; it is fined under this process and not the guidelines that are sentencing."

What we have found this day is that this bill has many problems because we chose to rush it to the floor because we had a deadline, and we cut off debate in committee.  We found amendments offered to fix parts of this bill that do not fix them but actually make them worse.  We have found out that the authors of the bill did not even know how much was going to be fined in the bill until we actually pointed it out.  Now we come to the biggest part: I have been here all day listening to: We have to keep criminals from having firearms. We have to keep criminals from having firearms.  I will say it once more, Madam Speaker: We must keep criminals from having firearms.  I am glad to let you know, Madam Speaker, we are now giving everyone in this body a chance to do just that.  A similar measure was promoted. What we are simply saying is that, if you have someone who is a criminal who came into our country illegally--criminal time number one--if they then try to buy or purchase a firearm which they are unable to do, that is the second strike as a criminal, and what we are simply saying is, if they do that, they will be reported to ICE.  Now, which Members in this body are opposed to notifying law enforcement when a person prohibited from purchasing a firearm attempts to do so? Are we against that? No.  I believe my friends across the aisle are not. I have heard it all day: We don't want criminals to have firearms.  But my question to you now, Madam Speaker, is--be very careful. If you vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, you cannot go back to your constituency, no matter what is said, and say: I voted to keep illegal aliens, those who should not have a firearm, from having a firearm.  We have heard it all day. And you can moan, you can talk, you can think about it, but, again, Madam Speaker, I understand the sympathy and the concern and the pain upon this bill, but let's not kid ourselves. The bill itself guts itself when it will not even allow a registry which the Obama administration said it had.  Let's actually get back to a point in saying, if there is something about this bill, give everybody an opportunity to actually keep a gun out of a criminal's hands and actually have that criminal punished for that by turning them in.  But, Madam Speaker and my colleagues, please listen to me right now. Hear me clearly. Hear me clearly. No matter what will be said in just a moment, no matter what the chairman or anyone else will say about this bill, if you vote ``no,'' you are voting to allow someone who should not have a firearm to get away with it and not be prosecuted for it.  Be very clear, Madam Speaker. You can try and make it look better. You can try and say: ``Well, it was not part of the bill. I have got to have the bill''; but never get away from the fact, Madam Speaker, if you vote ``no'' on this motion to recommit, you are making a choice to say: ``I guess some criminals can get away with trying to get a firearm.''  That is why this motion to recommit needs a ``yes'' vote. This is why we on this side stand for making sure that proper firearm safety is upheld while our rights are being upheld and, at the same time, looking to find real solutions, not perpetrating a fraud on those who are scared simply to pass a piece of legislation.  Madam Speaker, vote ``yes'' on the motion to recommit and actually keep guns out of criminals' hands.  Madam Speaker, I yield back balance of my time."

                    "speech":"Madam Speaker, let's remember what we are dealing with. We are dealing with the fact that current Federal law with respect to firearms background checks is dangerously limited and flawed because background checks are only required for sales by licensed gun dealers and that many, many people get a gun at a gun show or from someone else. Something like 20 percent, I think the figure is, or 25 percent of gun sales escape background checks.  So all kinds of people who may be criminals, who may be mentally ill, and who may be domestic abusers who shouldn't have guns get guns, and that results in lives forfeited. It results in people killed.  This bill goes a long way toward solving that by saying we are going to require background checks of everyone who gets a gun, with some exceptions, with some reasonable exceptions which are in the bill.  Now, along comes this motion to recommit, which is a total red herring having nothing to do with the purpose of the bill, and says that, if someone fails a background check because he is illegally in this country, you should report that to ICE.  First of all, if he fails a background check because he is illegally in the country, that means the system knows he is illegally in the country. It means they already know that.  So what is the point of reporting him? He has to be in the system as illegally in the country in order to fail the background check because of section (g)(5). So we already know that, and this is totally circular, number one.  Number two, this is just a red herring to try to mix up the immigration issue with the gun violence issue, and they really have nothing to do with each other.  Number three, for 8 years, we couldn't get a hearing--not a hearing in a committee--on this bill or on any real bill to stop the plague of handgun violence in this country.  Madam Speaker, 150 people killed in Great Britain, 95 in Austria or wherever, 39,000 in the United States--no one will tell me that Americans are 10,000 times as mentally ill as Europeans or Japanese. The problem is we don't have adequate protections on guns. This bill goes in the direction of doing it, and they want to sabotage the bill with a phony issue raised by this MTR.  Now, there is an issue. If people fail the background check for various reasons, then you can make a case it should be reported to local law enforcement agencies. Mr. Cicilline has a bill to do just that. I am going to yield to him in a second. But the fact is it has nothing to do with this bill. It is just an attempt to sabotage this bill.  If you believe that we ought to cut down on the plague of gun violence in this country, that we ought to save lives, that we ought to get rid of all these people who shouldn't have guns having guns, and that we ought to have background checks in sensible situations, then vote against the motion to recommit and for the bill.

There are women, men, and families all across America who are demanding that Congress do something. We are about to do this, and you raise a motion to recommit on a phony issue to try to muck this up with this gimmick. If you were concerned about reducing gun violence in this country and passing commonsense gun safety legislation, you had 8 years to bring a bill to the floor.  But if you are really concerned about this, I have good news for you. I have legislation, because, in fact, if someone buys a gun who is a prohibited purchaser, whatever their immigration status is, if they have committed a crime, then they should be arrested and prosecuted. Every single Democrat believes that.  So I have a piece of legislation that says, if that happens, notify the field office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the local law enforcement agency, and the State law enforcement agency, the agencies responsible for enforcing the criminal law, so they can arrest and prosecute that person.

Thankfully, the EPA is revisiting this regulation in an effort to provide flexibility and relief moving forward.  For many small oil and gas producers, these requirements contained in the original regulation are simply unworkable and overly burdensome.  For example, the regulation would even apply to wells that produce less than 15 barrels of oil and less than 90,000 cubic feet of natural gas per day. Because these wells produce at low volumes, the profit margin remains tight for the operators.  However, under the original rule, these low-volume producers would be subject to expensive upgrades, additional reporting requirements and administrative costs in order to comply with the regulation.  Madam Speaker, today I introduced H.R. 1391, the Methane Relief Act of 2019, which would exempt these low-volume wells from the rule's requirements. Doing so will allow for commonsense regulatory relief and certainty for these smaller operators which account for an important part of our domestic energy industry."

After 46 people were gunned down at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, I sat on this very floor in protest. My colleagues and I sat in solidarity with a very clear but somber message: No more. No more moments of silence. No more inaction while Americans had senseless deaths due to gun violence. No more would the entirety of solutions to gun violence be tweets with our thoughts and prayers.  It has been 2 years since the sit-in and, finally, the inaction has come to an end. Thanks to the brave survivors, the students, the advocates, and the family members, we have been able to pass commonsense gun safety.  Today is a new day, and we will continue this fight."

                    "speech":"Madam Speaker, I thank the majority leader and all of those persons in leadership who make it possible for us to have these opportunities.  I am especially proud to be here tonight because we have two resolutions that will be presented. These two resolutions have been presented before. One is H. Res. 154. This resolution is one that honors and praises the NAACP, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The second is H. Res. 155. It is a Black history resolution.  It is interesting to note that the NAACP was founded during Black History Month. The NAACP was founded February 12, 1909. The NAACP has a proud history, and I will say more about it in just a moment.  Next, I would like to talk for a brief moment about the resolution that we have for Black History Month.  Black History Month didn't start out as Black History Month. The Honorable Carter G. Woodson initiated what was called Negro History Week. Negro History Week was a time for us to acknowledge the accomplishments of African Americans, at that time called Negroes. We have metamorphosed through many titles, many names, from Negroes to African Americans.  Black History Month was something that Mr. Woodson found to come into being in 1976. This was done by President Joe Ford. As it has been designated as Black History Month, we have celebrated it as such across the length and breadth of this Nation.  Carter G. Woodson was a person with great vision. He obviously knew that in 1926, when this was initially brought to the attention of the public, there was not a good likelihood that you would be able to have a Black History Month. But he knew that, if you can start someplace, you might finish in a greater place. So he started in 1926 with Black History Week, and it has metamorphosed into a month.  You and I know that every day is a day that we should celebrate all history, and Black history is no exception. I am not a person who believes that we should have Black History Month forever. I think that Black history, properly incorporated and celebrated within American history and world history, would be more than enough. But today, we are honored to celebrate Black History Month and the NAACP as an organization that was founded during Black History Month.  I would like to say just a few words about this NAACP resolution in terms of the first time we brought it to the floor of the Congress of the United States of America.  When we brought it to the floor the very first time, the cosponsor of the resolution was Mr. Henry Hyde, and the person who controlled the time was Mr. Jim Sensenbrenner. Mr. Sensenbrenner, at that time, was the chairperson of the Judiciary Committee. I recall Mr. Sensenbrenner standing over to my right and making his commentary about the NAACP. He spoke with a degree of fervor that I thought was needed at the time.  Mr. Sensenbrenner, while he brought it to the floor and did direct the traffic, I would note that it was not an easy resolution to get past the House of Representatives. It did pass with consent of the House. It was agreed to, if you will.  Mr. Sensenbrenner and Mr. Hyde had a difficult time getting it through the House. I am proud that they did, and I am pleased that none of the Members at that time voiced objections to the resolution being agreed to. Mr. Sensenbrenner I will always remember as a person who was a champion for this resolution, and Mr. Hyde was the cosponsor of the NAACP resolution.  The NAACP is celebrating its 110th anniversary. This is probably the Nation's oldest and best known civil rights organization, founded on February 12 of 1909, the date of the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, the centennial of his birth.  It is interesting to note that Black History Month was considered because of Abraham Lincoln's birth as well, so the two resolutions have this in common, Black History Month and the NAACP's being celebrated and recognized today.  It was founded by a diverse group of persons who were outstanding citizens. I would also add that it was not founded by a group of persons all of whom were African American. I will call off the names for you to give you some indication.  Ida Wells-Barnett, the well-known W.E.B. Du Bois, Henry Moscowitz, Mary White Ovington, Oswald Garrison Villard, and William English Walling--all persons who were founders of the NAACP.  The NAACP, for the early part of its history, had a minority of minorities, meaning African Americans were not the dominant force within its leadership. They had persons who were carrying the torch of freedom such that African Americans could be a part of it. But it is interesting to note that, early on, the leadership was predominantly Anglo persons.  The NAACP, as indicated, is the oldest, largest, and most widely recognized grassroots-based civil rights organization in the United States. The active membership is in all 50 States, including State conferences of branches and local branches, as well as branches in prisons and chapters on college campuses and high schools throughout the Nation.  The NAACP has its national headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland.  The NAACP is here to ensure the political, educational, social, and economic rights of all persons and to eliminate racial hatred and racial discrimination.  The NAACP is committed to achieving its goals through nonviolence, including negotiation, litigation, and protestation.  The NAACP is well known for its litigation. The Honorable Thurgood Marshall, an African American to become Supreme Court Justice, was the chief litigator for the NAACP. Under his leadership, with the assistance of a good many other people, the NAACP was able to win many lawsuits before the Supreme Court. The lawsuit Brown v. Board of Education is one of the most notable lawsuits that the NAACP championed.  The NAACP has used political pressure, marches, demonstrations, and effective lobbying to secure the voice for those who are considered voiceless in the United States of America.  The NAACP has been fighting segregation in public schools under the leadership of Thurgood Marshall, as I indicated earlier, and its greatest victories, of course, include, as I indicated, Brown v. Board of Education.  The NAACP, in 2005, launched the Disaster Relief Fund to help hurricane survivors in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Florida, and Alabama to rebuild their lives.  So the organization has metamorphosed into one that does more than champion the causes of civil rights as they relate to persons being discriminated against. It also champions the causes of those who are among the least, the last, and the lost in our society: persons who have been locked out, persons who have been left behind, persons who but for the NAACP might not have a voice.  I was very honored to be a part of the NAACP's disaster relief help. I am also honored to have been a branch president of the NAACP in Houston, Texas.  The NAACP was instrumental in the enactment of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr., Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which generally and greatly expanded the legal definition of a hate crime. This was an important piece of legislation. I was honored to be here at the time we took up the legislation.  Hate crimes are still crimes that we have to not only acknowledge exist, but the law ought to have consequences for persons who commit these dastardly deeds.  Throughout its existence, the NAACP has led the charge to defend the constitutional right to vote. That is an important piece of commentary, the right to vote. The NAACP is still a part of the effort to assure every person the right to vote in this country.  The NAACP has taken on the challenge of dealing with the photo IDs that are required in an insidious way. It has also taken on the challenge of making sure that persons are properly registered so that they can vote, and also making sure that those who would thwart the efforts to register persons to vote are not successful in doing so.  The NAACP has led the effort to strengthen the Voting Rights Act and to protect the principle of one person, one vote. The NAACP led the charge in raising awareness about and challenging voter suppression laws in Federal courts across the Nation.  The NAACP board of directors unanimously elected Derrick Johnson as its President and CEO, who is doing an outstanding job. I am proud to be associated with him and the endeavors.  I am a proud member of the NAACP. I have been such for a good deal of my life. I am honored to have a life membership, to have a golden heritage membership, and to have a diamond membership.  I believe those of us who have benefited from the NAACP ought to be members of the organization that has made it possible for us to have many of the opportunities that we have. I always acknowledge my membership in the organization, and I encourage others to do so who happen to be members as well: the NAACP, a proud organization that we celebrate during this Black History Month.  The Black history resolution covers more than the NAACP. It talks about Black migrations. It emphasizes the movement of people of African descent to new destinations and new social realities. This focuses on, primarily, the migration of African Americans in this country. It focuses specifically on the 20th century through today.  It deals with patterns of movement, including the relocation of persons of African ancestry from Southern farms to Southern cities; from the South to the Northeast, Midwest, and West; and from the Caribbean to the United States. Black people have been in motion in the 20th century and up to this date, and this resolution acknowledges this. It also talks about the interactions with law enforcement that often result in some ugly circumstances, imprisonment and convict leasing.  Convict leasing is something that we should give a little bit more emphasis to.  In the State of Texas, we recently discovered a grave site containing 95 bodies. These 95 bodies were of persons who were victims of the State's law that allowed convict leasing.  Many times persons were charged with minor offenses and while they were incarcerated, they could be leased to private parties for the purpose of having them work as convicts. And many times--too often, I might add--the persons who were leased out, were not treated properly. In fact, they were treated poorly.  Many times they were not given proper food, proper clothing, and proper shelter; and as a result, many of them died at an early age. In this grave of 95 persons, there are persons who were thought to have been teenagers at the time of that death.  We are not absolutely sure they were all African Americans, but the suspicion is that a good many of them were. Some of them were likely to have been Anglos as well.  After finding their bodies in Sugar Land, Texas, on the site of a school, school property, the bodies were exhumed, and they were to be relocated to another place. And in so doing, a good many of the citizens, the activist community, decided that this was an inappropriate thing to do--the bodies being exhumed and reinterred at another location.  There was a serious meeting before the school board. And the school board and the county commissioners, the commissioners court decided that it would be appropriate to further study the possibility of inhuming these bodies in the place where they were exhumed.  And my hope is we would follow through on this and give them not only a burial site with a proper plaque to memorialize their being in this place, but also to do a little bit more and have some sort of structure or facility that would allow persons to acquire intelligence about what actually happened to these people, how they lived, and how they died, and why.  This country has come a long way, but, of course, we still have much more to do. But we want to make sure that we do not overlook the history associated with persons who were leased as convicts to private persons for the purpose of performing work for them.  This migration that I spoke of earlier, known as the Great Migration, was caused by a lack of economic opportunities because of harsh segregation laws in the south and because of the terror that was perpetrated against African American communities by the KKK.  The KKK, obviously, was active in the south; and the KKK, obviously, was in the business of terrorizing African American persons. And it is interesting to note that while this House has condemned a good many persons for their activities, I have not been able to find a record showing that the KKK has been condemned for its activities by way of a resolution that actually focuses on a person who has been associated with that organization.  The KKK has a horrible history in this country, and it is my hope that we in the House of Representatives will take up a resolution condemning this entity for what it has done.  I plan to bring such a resolution to the attention of the House.  This resolution on black history indicates that prior to 1910; more than 90 percent of African Americans lived in the south. And by the 1970s, 47 percent of all African Americans were living in the north and in the west.  This is why it is called the Great Migration. When you have this much of a population moving for opportunities, moving for reasons associated with concern for their well-being, that is a significant migration.  And during World War I, when slowing immigration from Europe created a labor shortage in the north, companies began recruiting African Americans to fill the assembly lines, to work in steel mills and railroads and factories. It was not unusual to hear persons talk about ``going up north,'' going up north so that they could have opportunities in the north that they were unable to acquire in the south.  African Americans who migrated to the north still faced racial discrimination in the form of redlining, in the form of racially based housing ordinances, in the form of higher rent based on race, and for the resurgence of the KKK, and the rising instances of race riots.  African Americans were not always welcomed with open arms when they sought to migrate to these new destinations.  African Americans created their own cities and neighborhoods, free of discrimination, where their culture expanded.  For example, in Harlem, New York City, that housed over 200,000 African Americans, there was a culture that was created there in Harlem. And we are proud to say that that culture still exists. Harlem has been a very important part of African American history.  Efforts were made to provide educational opportunities for African Americans, including the founding of what is now North Carolina Central University.  Greenwood, Oklahoma, is another part of the history that we ought to acknowledge. It was a part of Tulsa, and became the home of a thriving black business--a section also known as Black Wall Street--until the Tulsa riot of 1921, in which a white mob literally burned down Greenwood.  U.S. history has some parts of it that we are not proud of, but we do have to acknowledge.  In Houston, Texas, there is an area known as Freedmen's Town. And freed slaves were given the opportunity to purchase land and build their homes along the bayou, known as Buffalo Bayou in Houston, Texas. And this was at the end of the Civil War.  And over six decades, the town thrived with churches and schools and stores and theaters and jazz spots--clubs, if you will. This was a thriving area dominated by African Americans.  I would also like to mention another personality;  Judge Frank M. Johnson, who was said to be one of the most courageous judges ever to occupy a Federal bench; he was a part of the effort to integrate the south. There are many people who have praised him, including Dr. Martin Luther King.  He is the person who issued the order to require the constabulary to allow the marches to proceed across the Edmund Pettus Bridge as they marched from Selma to Montgomery.  He is the person who filed the order--along with the other judges--to integrate the bus line, that was called the Montgomery bus boycott. He opened the doors to persons of all hues, especially those of African ancestry who had been locked out.  Frank M. Johnson will ever be remembered as a champion of human rights. In fact, he will also be remembered as a person who did it under adverse circumstances, because he had to have, for many years, 24-hour security. His mother's home was torched at one time.  It was not easy to be on the side of African Americans in the early part of history.  Frank M. Johnson took such a stand.  We would also recognize Senator Edward Brooke, III, who became the first African American popularly elected to the United States Senate.  He was from Massachusetts, and he served there for many years. He was the first attorney general of African ancestry in any state.  In 1962, he cowrote the Civil Rights Act of 1968, which prohibited discrimination in housing. He was the first Republican to call for President Nixon's resignation in light of the Watergate scandal.  The history of African Americans in the north is one that is rich; the history in the south is one that is rich; but they all started, to a greater extent, with a migration that proceeded from the south to many destinations in the north, as well as in the west.  So today, we have a resolution that encourages the continued spread of knowledge regarding black history, and that it not be limited to one month, but that we do this throughout the entire year.  I am so honored that my colleagues have signed on to this resolution. We have had more than 60 colleagues to sign on to one, and I would hope that as we continue to present these resolutions, we will have more persons who will find favor with them.  In closing, simply this: The success that we have had as African Americans--if we look closely at our history--we will find that it was not something that was acquired by our own efforts alone.  Of course, we have done our part to extricate ourselves from some circumstances that were indeed unpleasant and very harmful and hurtful, but there were other persons who were there to be of assistance and help.  Many of the stations at the Underground Railroad had persons who were not of African ancestry that were there for us as we were traversing our way to freedom.  In many of the battles that were fought in the courtrooms, there were persons who were funding the litigation that were not of African ancestry.  The Spingarn brothers are such persons. The NAACP awards its highest medal annually in the name of the Spingarns.  When we have had few people to stand with us, the Jewish community has been there. When we have had few people to stand with us, the LGBTQ community has been there. When we have had few to stand with us, we have had persons of all stripes; Muslims have been there; persons of all faiths have been there. At the March on Washington, if you take a close look at that march, you will see persons of many hues, many stripes, persons from many walks of life.  So we are here today, proud to be here in the well of the Congress of the United States of America, but we understand that we didn't get here by ourselves, and we are proud to celebrate black history. But we are also proud to acknowledge that black history includes the history of a lot of persons who were associated with our efforts to acquire our freedom, our liberty, and the opportunities that we enjoy today.  Madam Speaker, I thank you very much for the time, and I proudly yield back the time such that you may continue with the business of the House."

The President should be commended for his personal commitment to persuading Kim Jong Un to pursue a different path.  By January 2017, it was clear the prior administration's policy of strategic patience had not worked. In retrospect, it was not very strategic to sit patiently while North Korea dramatically expanded its nuclear and missile capabilities. The Trump administration, in taking a different path, moved quickly to adopt the policy of maximum pressure, rallying international partners to respond firmly to North Korea's provocations. The President also demonstrated a willingness to engage the North Korean leader directly, breathing new life into our diplomacy to solve this seemingly intractable problem.  The President has gone the extra mile to demonstrate his sincerity in wanting to resolve this issue. It was smart to bring Kim Jong Un to Singapore and to Vietnam to expose the North Korean delegation to the kind of economic prosperity that could be possible if he were to choose a new path.  High-level diplomacy can carry high-level risk, but the President should be commended for walking away when it became clear insufficient progress had been made on denuclearization. Kim Jong Un now has a long train ride home, and he will have time to reflect on the future that is still within North Korea's grasp, but the President has demonstrated that such a future must be accompanied by real denuclearization.  Every country has a stake in North Korea's denuclearization. I hope China and other countries with influence over Kim Jong Un will do their part to urge him to return to the negotiating table and seize the opportunity to bring prosperity to the people of North Korea and peace and stability to the Korean Peninsula and to the region."

                "speech":"Madam President, on another matter, this week, the Senate has made progress in confirming President Trump's nominees. On Tuesday, Eric Miller became the 31st circuit court judge to be confirmed under this administration. Yesterday, we confirmed Michael Desmond to serve as Chief Counsel at the IRS.  Of course, this progress is only remarkable given the Senate Democrats' historic level of obstruction. As I noted yesterday, for example, Mr. Desmond's nomination earned near-unanimous approval from the Finance Committee in August of last year but only this week received a vote on the Senate floor. So many important roles are still vacant with well-qualified nominees who are ready and willing to fill them.  Later today, we will vote on Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the EPA. Mr. Wheeler has spent the last year as Deputy and now as Acting Administrator. He has wasted no time in proving he has what it takes to lead the Agency. In drawing on a wealth of experience that includes service as staff director of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee and a tenure at the EPA that first began back in 1991, Mr. Wheeler has proven his ability to advance pragmatic solutions to pressing environmental challenges. I hope each of my colleagues will join me in supporting yet another well-qualified nominee and vote to confirm him.  Later today, we will also have an opportunity to take care of one other long-overdue item--the nomination of John Ryder to the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority. Even after being reported out of committee twice on a voice vote, this well-qualified, uncontroversial nominee was nearly subjected to a needless cloture vote this week. I am glad that, instead, we will be voting to confirm Ryder and sending him on to work on behalf of the Tennessee Valley communities."

                "speech":"Madam President, on another matter, I have been spotlighting all week our Democratic colleagues' hard left turn toward socialism--their fixation on gaining more government control over more of our lives. With the Democratic Politician Protection Act, Washington Democrats want to control more of what Americans can say about them and how they get elected.  With the so-called Green New Deal, Washington Democrats want our government to spend more money than the entire gross domestic product of the entire world on new spending programs to forcibly remodel Americans' homes, take away our cars, dramatically increase energy costs, and disarm our economy while China roars straight ahead. You might think that right there is plenty of leftwing social engineering. You might think it is enough--oh, but they aren't stopping there, the Democrats. They are going after Americans' healthcare and their private health insurance plans.  Earlier this week, House Democrats introduced a bill that would take away every private insurance option that American families rely on and force everyone into a single, government-run system. Employer-sponsored coverage wouldn't just be discouraged, it would be illegal. They call this legislation Medicare for All. It is really more like ``Medicare for None.'' It completely explodes the Medicare system as it currently exists. The program our seniors have paid into for decades and now rely on, the Democrats want gone--wiped out.  Remember, by the time Americans turn 65, most have paid tens and tens of thousands of dollars into the current system through Medicare taxes. According to one estimate, Americans with average earnings who reached the retirement age back in 2015 will have paid a present value of more than $70,000 into Medicare over the years.  American seniors have counted on Medicare. They have planned around it, and they have paid into it with every paycheck. Yet now House Democrats have decided it is time to change the rules on them in the middle of the game. They want to tear down Medicare until the only thing left is the name and slap that name on a completely different system that a few House Democrats invented and that the Democratic Socialists of America is proud to endorse. The Democratic Socialists of America is proud to endorse that. Then the Democrats propose to take that new government system and pile every single American into it as a one-size-fits-all--long waits for treatment, higher costs, and an end to Medicare as we know it--no choice, no options, and no alternatives allowed.  More than 170 million Americans currently get health insurance through their employers. Surveys show that a majority is actually pretty happy with its own specific plans. Well, too bad. The Democrats want those families thrown off those plans. Within 2 years, their proposal would make private health insurance, as Americans know it, illegal across the board. It would be unlawful for employers to offer health benefits to their employees and their families. It is right there in the bill. It would be against the law for employers to offer healthcare to their employees.  Here is what it reads: ``It shall be unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage . . . [or] an employer to provide benefits . . . that duplicate the benefits provided under this Act by the government.''  How about that? We all remember ObamaCare's famous broken promise: If you like your healthcare plan, you can keep it. If you like the doctor you have, you can keep your doctor too. That was the pledge before the Democrats' policy was actually implemented. Not long after, the fact checkers named that promise their ``lie of the year.''  Well, this time around, my Democratic friends are not even bothering to pretend that families' lives would not be disrupted. A reporter asked one of our Senate colleagues who is running for President, ``So for people out there who like their insurance, they don't get to keep it?'' Her response? Listen to this. ``Let's eliminate all of that.'' This is one of our colleagues running for President.  All the plans American families like and rely on made illegal--illegal--by this bill, not just unaffordable, not just inconvenient, illegal, and all to clear space for a new government takeover.  So how much is this massive takeover going to cost? Well, under even conservative estimates, this proposal would cost more than $32 trillion over the first 10 years--$32 trillion over the first 10 years, more than the Federal Government spent on everything over the last 8 years combined.  Where is that money going to come from? Well, I think we all know the answer to that: massive tax hikes on the American people, cuts to services, rationing of healthcare, broken promises, and debt. That is where it is going to come from.  Here is what one economist found in the numbers.       The Federal Reserve's data only go back to 1929, but it's      unlikely that the government ever collected more than 20      percent of GDP in taxes. To fully fund Medicare-for-all, that      figure would have to rise to more than 30 percent of GDP.  Now, look, I am sure we will hear the class warfare rhetoric about soaking the rich and making a small group of Americans pay for all of this, but it will not be true. We all know it will not be true. The bill for this $32 trillion takeover would land squarely--squarely--on middle-class families. There is no way around it.  Even if the IRS confiscated every dollar of Americans' adjusted gross incomes over $1 million--took it all--if the IRS took every cent over $1 million, it wouldn't even pay for half of the proposal--wouldn't even pay for half of it.  Now, look, class warfare may be a favorite tactic across the aisle, but numbers are stubborn things. Math is math. The costs would have to fall on the middle class. Actually, they would fall on everyone, one way or another.  That economist put it this way, he said: ``The simple fact is that financing Medicare-for-all would require a dramatic shift in the Federal tax structure and a substantial tax increase for almost all Americans.'' Almost all Americans.  So let's sum it up. Washington Democrats want the American people to fork over a recordbreaking percentage of our gross domestic product in taxes for the privilege of having their healthcare plans ripped away from them, even if they are happy with what they have, and the middle class is going to pay for it. What a great deal.  All this, and I haven't even begun to explain how this takeover would cut Americans' access to care and degrade the quality of care. We have all heard horror stories from abroad about bureaucrats making decisions instead of citizens and long waits for treatment.  Last year in Canada, the median wait time for medically necessarily treatment from a specialist was 21 weeks--21 weeks. That is the average wait time for medically necessary treatment in Canada--more than double what it was up there just 25 years ago. In the UK, it is not just long waits patients have to contend with, it is flatout denials of care. In the first quarter of last year alone, Britain's National Health Service abruptly canceled 25,000 surgeries--canceled them.  Imagine that--being fully reliant on the government for healthcare, planning on a medically necessary procedure, and being told at the last minute the whole thing was called off. Welcome to socialized medicine. Needless to say, if some Democrats had their way, you wouldn't have to imagine much longer.  Before I conclude, I want to highlight one more thing. I suppose no far-left wish list like this would have been complete without radical policies on the issue of abortion, without trying to hurt pro-life Americans.  Sure enough, this legislation would shatter the longstanding consensus--consensus--that Federal dollars should not pay for abortions and force taxpayers to fund abortions nationwide. That has been the longstanding consensus. Talk about a perfect case study in the perils of a Federal takeover. Talk about a perfect example of why Washington Democrats should not get the power to twist American healthcare to suit their own radical views--$32 trillion, every family kicked off its insurance plans, no choice, no options for the middle class, just a huge bill.  The Democrats are so confident the American people will love their new government plan that they feel the need to make other kinds of insurance illegal, and Democratic Presidential candidates are rushing headlong to embrace all of this--watching them embrace all of this. Goodness. If this is one of their best and brightest new ideas, I would sure hate to see the bad ones.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, several hours ago, in the middle of the night here in the United States, we received word that the summit in Hanoi between the United States and North Korea would be ending prematurely. Unable to reach an understanding on either sanctions relief or denuclearization, President Trump decided to walk away from the talks without an agreement.  Though I don't know the details yet, and I look forward to speaking with Secretary Pompeo, I was pleased to see the President recognized North Korea's unwillingness to strike a comprehensive deal. President Trump did the right thing by walking away and not cutting a poor deal for the sake of a photo op.  Just like the President, I want a deal with North Korea that will bring an end to the conflict and change the course of the region. However, I have always been concerned about the possibility of a bad deal, especially with the other pressures currently on the President. A deal that fell short of complete, verifiable denuclearization would have only made North Korea stronger and the world less safe, and it would have squandered the substantial leverage our negotiators have now thanks to the bite of sanctions.  President Trump must now apply the lesson of North Korea diplomacy to our trade negotiations with China. President Trump must have the courage to do the same thing with China as he has done for North Korea. The President must be willing to hold the line and walk away if China does not agree to meaningful, enduring, structural reform of its unfair trading policy. President Trump should not fall into the trap of seeking a deal for the sake of a deal, especially now that talks with Pyongyang are on hold.  What he did in North Korea was right. He must do the same thing in China--hold out because he has the upper hand--until we get China to do the right thing. Just because an accord is, for the moment, out of reach in North Korea does not mean that the President should be any more eager to strike one with China if the terms are inadequate or unacceptable.  The President deserves credit for bringing China to the negotiating table with tariffs, but he must not squander that opportunity by cutting a deal that fails to achieve American priorities. Unless China promises to end its predatory cyber theft of American intellectual property and know-how, unless China promises to stop artificially propping up its businesses, unless China promises to end its practice of forcing American companies to give away their IP to their future Chinese competitors in order to do business in China, President Trump should walk away from the negotiations once again.  As important as North Korea is to national security, China is just as critical--maybe even more critical--to American economic security. President Trump and his team have a generational imperative to get this one right. They have a generational imperative not to squander the chance to achieve permanent reforms to China's economic relations with the world, changes that would finally put American investors, businesses, and workers on a level playing field."

Background checks are supported overwhelmingly by close to 90 percent of the American people--a majority of Republicans, a majority of gun owners. It doesn't take anyone's guns away. It simply says that if you are a felon, spousal abuser, or adjudicated mentally ill, you shouldn't have a gun, and it takes the means to make sure that happens.  Now there are so many loopholes in the background check law--the Brady law, which I was proud to lead the charge on back in the House in 1994. Now, some 25 years later, they have found ways around it through the internet and through gun shows. Just as it was the right thing to do to close the loopholes that existed in 1994 with the Brady law, it is the right thing to do to close those loopholes that have come about since the law passed. It simply updates the Brady law, which has saved tens of thousands of lives."

One of the great but positive ironies of Leader McConnell's stunt to put the Green New Deal on the floor is that it has inspired Members of both parties to talk about climate change--more than ever before, maybe--under the Republican leadership in the Senate.  Democrats are more than happy about that. We want to turn the spotlight back to the issue of climate change and keep it there, where it belongs. Climate change is an existential threat to our planet, not just in the future but right now. We should be talking about climate change nearly every day, and more than that, the Senate should be taking bold action to address it.  So I am glad at least Leader McConnell is talking about climate. He just says what he is not for.  So I will repeat the three questions I have asked Leader McConnell repeatedly: One, Leader McConnell, do you believe that climate change is real? Two, do you believe, Leader McConnell, that it is caused by humans? Three, do you believe Congress should take immediate action to address the crisis of climate change?  Until Leader McConnell puts something positive on the floor and starts talking positively, no one is going to pay much attention to his stunts and his gambits, but, certainly, we Democrats are energized to talk positively about the things we want to do to deal with this issue, and we will be positive and discuss positive proposals until we get something done in this Chamber.

                "speech":"Madam President, just in getting started this morning, I wanted to take a minute to mention the good news on economic growth we received this morning.  While headlines mentioned the very solid 2.9 percent growth number for 2018, if we use the measure that economists prefer, the news is even better--3.1 percent growth from the fourth quarter of 2017 to the fourth quarter of 2018. This is just more evidence that Republican economic policies are working.  We lifted burdensome regulations and passed a comprehensive reform of our Tax Code to put more money in Americans' pockets and make it easier for businesses to grow and expand jobs. Now we are seeing the effects.  Unemployment is low. January marked the 11th straight month that unemployment has been at or below 4 percent. That is the longest streak in nearly five decades. The number of job openings hit a record high in December, and, once again, there were more job openings than job seekers. Wage growth has accelerated. Wages have now been growing at a rate of 3 percent or greater for 6 straight months. The last time wage growth reached this level was in 2009. Median household income is at an all-time, inflation-adjusted record of $61,372. The list goes on.  What does all of this mean? It means more money in American families' bank accounts, more jobs and opportunities for American workers, more Americans feeling hopeful about their future.  Republican economic policies are making life better for American families, which is why it is particularly disturbing that Democrats are currently advancing policies that would not only destroy the economic progress we have made but would severely damage our economy for the long term."

                "speech":"Madam President, yesterday, I came down and talked about the so-called Green New Deal, which is a fantasy put forward by a number of our colleagues on the other side. I think 11 Democratic Senators have cosponsored that legislation, which the early analysis shows would cost somewhere between $51 trillion and $94 trillion over the next decade. To put that into more personal terms, that is $600,000 per family in this country--the cost of the Green New Deal.  My colleague from Illinois, the Democratic whip, was asked about it on an interview recently, and he responded by saying that he had read and reread the proposal and still doesn't know what the heck it is. Well, that is an honest answer. But I think what we do know is that this is a proposal that will dramatically, massively drive up costs for American families. It would be a disaster for the pocketbooks of the people of this country, which brings me to my topic for today.  On Tuesday, POLITICO released an article with this headline: ``House Democrats to release `Medicare for All' bill--without a price tag.'' That was the headline.  This is becoming par for the course for Democrats. First we get the Green New Deal resolution without a pricetag. Now we get Medicare for All, also without a pricetag. Why? Well, because there is no way to actually pay for these socialist fantasies. They sound nice, until you actually look at the staggering costs.  Imagine if you decided that you needed to repair the plumbing at your house, and the plumber came and suggested that not only should you repair the plumbing, you should rebuild the house from the ground up. Then he wanted you to sign on for demolition and reconstruction without telling you how much it would cost.  That is what Democrats are trying to do on a grand scale here. They want to overhaul large parts of the economy and rebuild them on socialist lines, all without telling you what it will cost or how they will pay for it.  Of course, while it is irresponsible, it is not surprising that Democrats don't want to discuss the pricetag for their fantasies, because there is no way to pay for these massive government takeovers without taxing ordinary Americans.  Democrats make vague suggestions that these programs can be paid for by taxing the rich. That is always the line. But the truth is that taxing millionaires at a 100-percent income tax rate would not pay for these programs. Taxing Americans making much less than $1 million at a 100-percent rate wouldn't pay for these programs.  The cost of these programs will never be borne just by millionaires. These programs will be paid for on the backs of working families in this country. That is the pure and simple reality.  A left-leaning think tank modeled a version of the Medicare for All plan proposed by the junior Senator from Vermont and found that it would cost a staggering $32 trillion over 10 years--$32 trillion--and it is possible that the House Democrats' plan could cost even more.  POLITICO noted in their story that, unlike the plan of the Senator from Vermont, the House Democrats' plan would also ``fund long-term care, a particularly expensive part of the health system.''  But moving away from the staggering pricetag, let's talk about what life would be like under Medicare for All.  For starters, of course, it would mean that Americans would lose their private insurance, even if they like their private insurance. Democrats have been very clear about this.  At a CNN townhall just this week, the junior Senator from Vermont was asked, ``Will these people be able to keep their health insurance plans, their private plans through their employers, if there is a Medicare for All program that you endorse?''  The Senator from Vermont's response: ``No.''  Another Democratic candidate for President, the junior Senator from New York, was recently asked:       Should ending private insurance, as we know it, be a      Democratic . . . goal, and do you think it's an urgent goal?  Her response:       Oh yeah, it is a goal. An urgent goal.  So if you like your health insurance, you definitely will not be able to keep it. You will be forced into the government healthcare plan, whether you like that plan or not. Then, of course, you will be facing long wait times and likely a limited choice of doctors and hospitals, and you will have fewer options if the government decides a particular treatment isn't cost-effective and shouldn't be covered.  Democrats can talk all they want about generous coverage, but what happens when they don't have the money for that generous coverage? We already know this program is likely to cost more than $30 trillion over just 10 years, and government programs aren't exactly known for staying under budget.  What happens if it ends up costing more or if the government can't even pay the $32 trillion that we know it is going to cost? Well, there will be still more taxes, undoubtedly, but also reductions in coverage and care.  Our Nation's current Medicare Program is going bankrupt. If action isn't taken, in 2026 Medicare will not be able to pay the benefits that are promised under current law. Yet Democrats are suggesting that we more than quintuple the size of the program and that somehow we will be able to pay for that.  If we ever do pay for Medicare for All, we will pay for it by taking the money from the American people through devastating tax increases that will permanently reduce Americans' standard of living and permanently damage our economy.  Like all socialist dreams, Medicare for All would quickly become a nightmare for the American people.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

I mentioned these reports earlier this week, but I want to update my friends in this Chamber that Democrats are in the process of preparing legislation that would defund this fake climate panel. We hope this legislation, like our resolution, will eventually be bipartisan because it shouldn't be partisan to oppose a group of handpicked climate deniers spreading the fossil fuel industry's propaganda under the imprimatur of the White House. It shouldn't be partisan to oppose the administration's setting up its own Orwellian Ministry of Truth on climate change.

                "speech":"Mr. President, second is the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be the next Administrator of the EPA--a question currently before the Senate. I opposed Mr. Wheeler's nomination to be the Deputy Administrator, and I will oppose his nomination to be Administrator as well.  I opposed Mr. Wheeler initially because I thought his career as a lobbyist working on behalf of big polluters and climate deniers was exactly the wrong kind of experience for a job at the EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency. He spent most of his career lobbying against the same environmental protections he now oversees, and his time at the EPA has done little to assuage my original concerns.  Mr. Wheeler has failed to take meaningful action on toxic chemicals, including the chemical PFAS, which has plagued my home State. He has downplayed the severity of climate change and undermined several EPA programs that seek to address it, including the regulation of poisonous mercury from powerplants, efforts to reduce carbon emissions from cars and trucks, as well as replacing the Clean Power Plan.  At a time when climate change is the No. 1 threat facing our planet, installing a man such as Mr. Wheeler as permanent Administrator of the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--is the wrong thing to do.  So as I said earlier this morning, Leader McConnell's move to bring the Green New Deal forward is nothing more than a stunt, but one of the great and positive ironies is that, finally, folks are talking about climate change again, more than at any time I can think of under this Republican majority.  If and when Leader McConnell brings his version of the Green New Deal forward for a vote, we will demand that Republicans first answer the core questions on climate change.  Again, three simple things: Do you believe climate change is real and happening? Do you believe human activity contributes to it? Do you believe Congress must act to address this pressing challenge?  If Leader McConnell and my Republican friends can't answer those three questions--run away from them--the American people will see right through the ploy. The American people will see that Leader McConnell and his party stand against science and against facts, ostriches with their heads buried in the sand as the tide swiftly comes in.

                "speech":"Mr. President, our Democratic leader has set three plain and very obvious questions about fossil fuel-burning carbon emissions and climate change that should be easily answered by every single Member of the Senate, and the fact that this is a problem is a clear indication of fossil fuel influence in this body--the regrettable extent of fossil fuel influence in this body.  It was not always this way. Here is a letter that a number of us came to the floor to talk about yesterday. The letter was written December 23, 1986. There had been hearings on climate change in the Environment and Public Works Committee, and a bipartisan group of Senators wanted some answers. They wrote this letter to what then existed, an Office of Technology Assessment for the Congress, inquiring about how serious they felt this was and what could be done about it, signed by Senator Stafford, Senator Chafee, Senator Durenberger, and three Democrats in 1986. I do not believe that a Republican Senator could be found to sign this letter today.  I got here in 2007, and for that year, and in 2008 and 2009, we had multiple bipartisan climate bills being discussed in this body. Over and over again, there were a Democrat and Republican who got together and worked to try to solve the climate problem--more than a decade ago. We have seen bipartisanship on this issue.  We have even seen, in 2009, this New York Times full-page advertisement signed by Donald J. Trump, which said that the science of climate change is ``scientifically irrefutable.'' Those were his words, not mine, in 2009, which said that if we don't act there would be ``catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet''--his words, not mine. That was 1986, that was 2007, and this was 2009.  Then something happened. Citizens United got decided by the Supreme Court or, to be fair to the Supreme Court, Citizens United got decided by five Republican appointees on the Supreme Court.  In my view, the fossil fuel industry asked for that decision, predicted that decision, and they were off like a sprinter at the gun when they got that decision. From that moment, all of that bipartisan activity on climate change here in the Senate ended, and it ended because the fossil fuel industry was allowed to spend unlimited money in politics. They found out how to spend unlimited dark money in politics. It is politically obvious that if one can spend unlimited money in politics, one can also threaten to spend unlimited money in politics. So between the unlimited spending and the unlimited, anonymous dark money spending and whatever they did in the way of threats and promises, it has been like a heart attack--flatlined--here in the Senate, since that moment. It is a tragedy.  In fact, if you go back to this letter for a minute, there were six signatories. We couldn't get six States to come to the floor yesterday because one of these States has two Republican Senators, and we couldn't get either of them to come to the floor.  I don't know what has happened to the Republican Party that they can't take this seriously even now--even as States like Florida are flooding on sunny days, even as States see wildfires they have never seen before, even as farmers are recording drought and flood conditions that are unprecedented, even as my State looks forward to 5 or 6 feet of sea level rise.  And then we got a clue as to what goes on here. This is a letter that was written on behalf of Andrew Wheeler, who is the slightly cleaned-up version of Scott Pruitt and who is pending before us to lead the Environmental Protection Agency. It ought to tell us a lot that the Republicans put up a coal lobbyist to represent the people of America leading the Environmental Protection Agency.  What tells you a lot also is this letter of support for this guy. Who is on it? These are these phony-baloney front group organizations funded by the fossil fuel industry that got together to write this letter:  The Heartland Institute. Koch-affiliated groups gave it $7.18 million, and $730,000 came from Exxon. Heartland is such a slippery, slimy group that they compared climate scientists to the Unabomber. That is the company that they travel in.  The Cornwall Alliance. Secret funding--we don't know, but they are always in this climate-denier fringe crowd. The founder doesn't believe in evolution. He said that tornadoes are a punishment from God, and that AIDS is punishment for being gay. You are running in great company with them, guys.  FreedomWorks is next. They received $2.5 million from Koch-affiliated groups, and at least $130,000 from the American Petroleum Institute.  The Competitive Enterprise Institute is next, with at least $2 million given from Exxon, and Koch-affiliated groups gave at least $5.2 million. Americans for Prosperity. This is basically the hit squad for the Kochs in politics. It is one of the largest dark-money election spenders, spending more than $70 million since Citizens United on Federal elections. They received a minimum of $12 million, that we know of, in funding from the Kochs and more than $23 million from the Koch-linked Donors Trust. Donors Trust, by the way, is a big enterprise whose sole purpose is to launder away the identity of big donors so that their money can flow without people knowing who is behind it.  Americans for Limited Government received at least $5.6 million from Koch-affiliated groups.  Freedom Partners is described as ``the Koch brothers' secret bank.'' It has spent more than $55 million in dark money on Federal elections since Citizens United and received at least $3 million from the Kochs, but, as usual, its funders are shrouded in secrecy.  Americans for Tax Reform. The American Petroleum Institute gave at least $525,000, and Koch-affiliated groups gave at least $330,000.  The Energy and Environmental Legal Institute received at least half a million dollars from Koch-affiliated groups.  CFACT received at least $580,000 in funding from Exxon and more than $8 million from Koch-linked groups.  Then, at the bottom is this little Caesar Rodney Institute, which is part of the larger State Policy Network, funded by the Kochs to spread their propaganda and poison into State legislatures.  This crew of fossil-fuel-funded, climate-denying front groups have received a minimum of more than $63 million from the fossil fuel industry, and this is why we have Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, lined up to run our environmental agency in this country.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to state the obvious--to state in clear terms what scientists have been warning us about for decades. The scientific data couldn't be any clearer. Climate change is real. Climate change is here, and we are causing its devastating impacts and disruptions. Unless we start to implement policies to curb our carbon emissions and to mitigate its impacts, climate change will continue to wreak havoc upon communities across the Nation and around the world.  These are facts. These facts present us with the greatest and most existential global challenge humanity has literally ever faced. There are not two sides to these facts. The Earth's five warmest years on record happened since 2014. It is not a coincidence. It is not an unexplained phenomenon. It is the direct result of both our actions and our inactions. Only the willfully ignorant refuse to acknowledge these facts and the gravity and urgency of what we face because of the fact of human-caused climate change.  Unfortunately, the current occupant of the White House and too many here in Washington can be counted in that camp. President Trump's decision to upend the Clean Power Plan and pull us out of the Paris climate accord was perhaps the most consequential representation of his inward-looking, isolationist view for America. It was a dangerous abdication of our Nation's leadership role on the international stage, and if we choose to accept his failure to lead here in Congress, we will continue down a path toward a very real and very costly climate disruption.  In the coming weeks, Majority Leader McConnell says he plans to call a vote here on the Senate on the Green New Deal resolution. I wish this were a genuine effort to address our climate challenges. Clearly, it is not. It is a political stunt by the majority leader to divide those who actually want to rise to the occasion and who actually want to address this crisis, rather than offer up any substantive solutions of his own.  The majority leader would have you believe that solutions to climate change are too costly or they are just too impractical to be taken seriously. I don't know about you, but to me, it is that view that is wildly out of touch and, frankly, dangerous.  President Trump and Republicans love to talk about the cost of climate action. What we should be focusing on is the much steeper cost of inaction and the economic benefits of America's leading the clean energy transition.  As an engineer, I am certain that our capacity to confront the challenges that we face, large and small, rests heavily on our ability to make policy that is actually driven by facts, by data, and by the best available science.  The latest data on climate change should be deeply alarming to all of us. Last fall, the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released a report based on the research of thousands of our planet's leading climate scientists. It laid out in stark terms how critical it is for us to find a way to limit the planet's warming. Unless we can reduce global carbon emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions by 2050, it will be nearly impossible to keep global temperatures below a rise of 3 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century.  I know that is a lot of numbers, but what those numbers mean in terms of real ecological, economic, and humanitarian costs is incredibly important. Global average temperatures have already risen by nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit, and that change is wreaking havoc on communities around the world.  One month after the U.N. released its landmark report, 13 Federal Agencies finalized the ``Fourth National Climate Assessment,'' a report mandated by Congress to study the evidence and the impacts of current climate change. That report provided clear, indisputable evidence that the destructive wildfires, the catastrophic hurricanes, and the extreme flooding that we have seen in just the last couple of years is directly linked to human-caused climate change. These disasters are costing us billions of dollars each and every year.  The Pentagon has correctly called climate change a threat multiplier, meaning that climate impacts will amplify the existing threats to our national security. These are massive problems today--right now--not in some far off future. We need to recognize what the science is telling us. We need to recognize that the impacts and the disasters that we have seen so far are just the beginning.  Things are only going to get more chaotic, more unpredictable, and more expensive unless we change our trajectory. That is going to require global cooperation. It is going to require scientific ingenuity, and serious, sober policymaking based on the facts in front of us to put us on a better path.  I am proud that a number of my colleagues are stepping up to think through what those actions, what those solutions, and what those policies should be. We can have a healthy debate about the best ways to achieve these reductions in our emissions, but we can't credibly dispute the science, what it is telling us, and the urgency of the need to act. These are facts. It is chemistry. Yet, instead of allowing us to productively debate those solutions, Majority Leader McConnell is planning to waste our time on a political stunt.  Since Republicans took control of the Senate, they have not brought a single bill to the floor that would address emissions--not a single one--and they have taken many actions that have actually made the situation worse. This is not the serious legislating that we were sent here to do. This is not problem-solving.  The Senate is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body. We are supposed to come together here on the Senate floor and in our committees and think through the greatest issues and challenges of our time. We are supposed to propose and debate policies to meet those challenges. I would welcome a long overdue debate on what policies would most efficiently and most effectively address our challenges.  I know that climate change often feels too big and too hard to fix, but, frankly, we all need to get out of that mindset because climate change is a problem we can solve. In fact, climate change is a problem that we must solve.  The good news is that we already have the technologies and the people to do it. Clean energy technologies have been evolving rapidly in recent years, and many of the clean energy technologies that seemed absolutely unrealistic only a decade ago have become the new normal. I see a future where my two boys will use a reliable, cheap, resilient electrical grid that is 100-percent powered by clean energy because of the technologies invented in this country and because of the technologies built and installed with American labor. We need to invest in actually deploying these technologies with the urgency necessary to make real progress. This should be a bipartisan priority, not only for its impact on curbing carbon emissions but because it will create millions of jobs in communities across this country.  Some States are already moving in this direction. In my home State, new wind farms and new solar generation are bringing in billions of dollars of private investment. They are creating thousands of new jobs. Without aggressive, forward-looking national policies, we will not move fast enough. The scale of this transformation will be gigantic. There is no doubt about that. But this great Nation is up to the challenge.  Thank you, Mr. President."

We know because the U.N. scientists at the end of 2018 issued a report saying that climate change is an existential threat to our planet. Our own U.S. scientists in the end of 2018 issued their own report. This is the Trump administration's scientists, much to his chagrin, who said: ``We must act to avoid substantial damages to the U.S. economy, environment, and human health and the well-being over the coming decades.''  These are earth-shattering science reports about the state of our planet. These are doomsday reports, which the scientists of our own country and the world are giving to us.

That is what this Senate will be voting on--a coal lobbyist to take over the environment of our country, as the scientists of our country tell us that we are facing an existential threat if we do not take urgent actions today.  Our majority leader yesterday called the Green New Deal ``foolish and dangerous.'' Well, with all due respect to my Republican colleagues, the only thing foolish and dangerous about the Green New Deal is to ignore the $400 billion in damages over the last 2 years from supercharged storms and wildfires, to ignore the tens of trillions of dollars in the damage that we will see from climate change in the United States by 2100 if we do not act, and the hundreds of trillions of damage across the entire planet if we are not the leader in creating a clean-energy revolution.  What is dangerous, I say to the leader, is sending our men and women in the military overseas to protect tankers of oil that are coming into our country from the Middle East. Superstorms, wildfires, rising seas, and other extreme weather events are the impacts of climate change if we do not act boldly to stop it. It isn't just dangerous; it is an existential threat to our planet, not from politicians or political scientists but from real scientists--``the'' scientists--the Nobel Prize-winning scientists of the whole planet and in our own country. They are telling us we are in danger, and this body has to take positive action to deal with it.  We have a ``Denier in Chief'' in the White House. We have a Republican leader who has brought climate bills to the floor while he has been leader, but they have been bills to make the climate even more dangerous--the Keystone Pipeline bill and drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil. The Republicans are today going to confirm a coal lobbyist to head the Environmental Protection Agency, which is the Agency charged with protecting the planet.  The reality is that the Republicans have no plan to deal with the climate crisis. That is why they want to short circuit this debate on the Green New Deal. Let's have a hearing. Let's hear from experts. Let's hear from scientists. Let's have the evidence in the U.S. Senate. Then we can decide--but, no, there will be no debate in the Senate on science. There will be no debate on the harm that is going to be done if we do not act. Instead, in the same period, there will be just an attempt to confirm a coal lobbyist to take over the Environmental Protection Agency and to derail any real debate on the Green New Deal. That is who they are.  Why is that? It is that the Green New Deal is dangerous. It is dangerous for the status quo to just continue to remain in place on climate change. It is dangerous for the Koch brothers and those who are used to killing every climate debate before it gets a chance to start. It is dangerous for those who want us to limp into a frightening future with no plan and no protections in place. It is dangerous for those who benefit from the continued devaluation of our workers, from the historic oppression of vulnerable communities, and from the continued destruction of the environment. That is who would think the Green New Deal is dangerous.  The Democrats want to support working families and support a safe climate future in which all communities are protected. We welcome debate on proposals for how to get there, but the science is clear on what we need to do and the magnitude of the response that we have to unleash in this country.  The Republicans may think the Green New Deal is just a resolution, but it is more than that. It is a revolution, and it cannot and will not be stopped. The science is driving this. It is an intergenerational concern that we are heading toward a catastrophe on this planet that could have been avoided, but we as a nation have stood on the sidelines and have allowed it to happen.  Ladies and gentlemen, this vote that we take as to whether Andrew Wheeler, a coal lobbyist, should be the head of the Environmental Protection Agency goes right through the heart of whether we are going to respond to the magnitude of this challenge. I do not know how anyone can vote for Andrew Wheeler given the science that has been presented to us, given the danger that we now know, given the catastrophe that is going to be created if we don't change course. This is just doubling down on a disaster. Andrew Wheeler is going to be the architect of the Republican plan to ensure that we do nothing about this climate catastrophe. The consequences could not be greater, but the political ramifications in the 2020 elections are going to be great as well. We will see a revolution that rises up across this country.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau asked: What is the use of a home if you don't have a tolerable planet to put it on?  We are here at a unique moment in human history when the planet is threatened. It is not just our local stream that has been polluted by some factory. It is not a river that is so toxic that it catches on fire. It is not just a small section of my home State that has been afflicted by some new disease in the forests. It is our entire planet that is at risk. So any Member of this Chamber who is not coming forward to help figure out how to address that is guilty of vast malpractice, legislative malpractice, and moral malpractice and incompetence because that is what a legislature is about. When there are big problems that we face, we come together. We don't ignore them. We wrestle with the best way to take them on. That is what this conversation is about.  Senator Carper's resolution says three things, the first of which is we have a real problem, and it is easy to demonstrate that. We can take a look at all of the information we have coming from every major scientific organization that tracks increasing heat on the planet, but maybe that is a little too complicated. Let's just ask a simple question. What have been the hottest years in human history? When have they been? Were they in the 1700s, in the 1800s, in the 1900s? When were those 5 hottest years? They were the last 5 years--2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018. This is no coincidence because that would be an astronomically unlikely thing to occur. We have enough science to know why this is occurring, not just that it is occurring.  It is occurring because we are generating carbon dioxide, and we are generating methane. They trap heat. We have been told, for the better part of a century, that this was going to be a problem, and the problem has arrived. It is not some theory. It is not some computer model. It is not some ivory tower. The facts are clearly evident. They are evident in our forests with longer and hotter fire seasons. They are evident in more powerful hurricanes than we have seen before because they draw so much more energy from an overheated ocean. We see it in the spread of diseases, like Lyme disease with the spread of tick populations. We see it with changing species. We see it with glaciers. We see it with melting permafrost. We see it with rising sea levels. We see it everywhere unless you are blind to the facts. We are not here to be blind. We are here to act. So we know the problem is real. That is the first point.  The second point is we know what is causing it--human activities, our putting methane into the air and putting carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, we know the third point, which is our responsibility to act.  So many of us have come forward and have said: Here is an idea. How about this? This will completely change the amount of carbon dioxide from the transportation sector. Here is an idea. This would really change the carbon dioxide generated by power generation, electricity generation. How about this? This would greatly reduce the carbon dioxide generated from heating buildings.  Yet, in that conversation, there is the sound of silence from the right side of the aisle. Do we hear multitudinous ideas? No. We hear none. That is where the legislative malfeasance and where the moral irresponsibility lies--in pretending that you can be a leader in this country, in this Senate Chamber, and not address this major challenge that is afflicting our planet. That is unacceptable. We don't need fake and phone debates on the floor of a resolution that hasn't gone through committee. We need real discussion and real engagement.  It was not that long ago that Republican leaders across this Nation were taking on this issue. H. W. Bush ran for the Presidency to take on climate change. When he got into office, he didn't end up doing a lot, but he ran on it and campaigned on it. Other leaders have said we have a responsibility to be good stewards of our resources. I have heard that from the Republican side of the aisle for my entire lifetime--good stewardship. So why the silence now? Why the failure to look at the facts? Why the failure to bring forward ideas? This is not OK. We need real debate, real discussion.  I have put forward ideas I would love to see debated, one being that we need to dramatically reduce the fossil fuels, which we own as a public, coming out of the ground. We have to lead the world, and we can't ask the rest of the world not to extract and burn fossil fuels if we are still profiting from doing so.  I laid out the vision--the 100-percent mission in all sectors--and how we can get there over the coming decades. It is a 300-page bill that is full of ideas. Maybe they are not all the best of ideas, but I encourage my colleagues to read them, to find ones they like, and to bring forward their ideas. Where do tax credits play in this conversation? Where do limits play on pollution? Where do incentives to transition to renewable energy come in? Let's have that debate as serious policymakers and leaders of this country who are responsible for our Nation and for the future of our planet.  Henry David Thoreau lived a long time ago, but he laid out the point that we are responsible for the health of our planet. Let's take that responsibility seriously. Let's engage. Let's debate every single idea. There are hundreds of them out there. Let's go through them. Let's forge a bipartisan plan. Let's not let any industry in America contaminate the process, the political process, through these dark donations. Let's not, any party in this country, be misled from addressing the serious issues before us because they are blinded by the hundreds of millions of dollars falling on their campaigns. Let's do what we have to do, what we have a responsibility to do. History will judge whether we have done that which cannot be delayed. That is our responsibility.  I thank the Presiding Officer."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as of now, there are zero climate proposals coming from Senate Republicans--none. So it becomes extraordinarily difficult to debate climate change when only one political party is committed to fixing it. I can't underscore this enough. I don't know if I can sort of stage direct the C-SPAN cameras, but if I can--if they would pan out--they would see an empty Chamber on the other side.  Look, if you don't like our proposals--if you don't like the investment tax credit or the production tax credit, if you don't like planting trees, if you don't like fuel efficiency standards, if you don't like mercury and air quality standards, if you don't like investing in high-tech research to find that next breakthrough or if you think climate change is a hoax, come down to the Senate floor and make your argument. Yet they are not even doing that. This is a planetary emergency--the most important moment in human history as it relates to the planet Earth--and the party in power is doing its best to make the problem worse.  Democrats want to invest in clean air, clean water, and smarter infrastructure. We have taken every chance we can to talk about climate and how to fix it. Senator Whitehouse alone has given 200 speeches on the Senate floor about the climate crisis.  The Republican response has been to try to make this silly, to score points about something that was posted on a Congresswoman's website and promptly removed and to make false statements saying Democrats want to ban cheeseburgers or whatever. That is because they don't want to debate this issue seriously because they don't have ideas on climate. Their only plan is to actively, aggressively make things even worse.  They need to make this debate about something--anything--other than what it is, which is a planet in crisis; weather getting weirder and worse, wildfires, coastal flooding, fisheries crashing. Pennsylvania farmers say they had the worst season they have had in 30 years because of all the rain they got last year, while farmers in the Midwest didn't get near enough. It is a rolling disaster happening right now.  In response, here is what the Republicans have done. They have put people who make their money from pollution in charge of regulating pollution. They have given oil and gas companies access to millions of acres of land and water that are supposed to be protected for things like conservation, hunting, hiking. They pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement, which means we are the only country on the planet not at the table when it comes to figuring out what to do about this problem.  They have made it easier for companies to put methane in the air or make cars that pump pollution into the air, and instead of just leaving coal companies alone, instead of saying, hey, let's let the market decide, they are actually looking to subsidize coal because now it is noncompetitive with wind and solar, in a lot of instances, but they actually want to subsidize coal so they can get another 10 or 20 years' worth of fossil fuel pollution. This is not what you would do if you were trying to stop climate change. This is what you do if you are trying to make it worse.  So let's take a closer look at some of the worst things on their list. First, you have to look at the people they have put in charge of conserving public lands and keeping air and water clean. This week, the Senate is voting on Andrew Wheeler to run the EPA. He is a coal lobbyist, and I know politicians are prone to sort of overstatement, rhetorical flourishes, but this guy is actually a coal lobbyist. He made his living working for coal. I don't know him. I presume he is an honorable fellow, but now we are supposed to believe he is the best person to keep coal companies in line, to make sure they follow the rules and don't hurt the air people breathe or the rivers they fish in.  If this were a movie about corruption in politics, this script would be thrown out because it was too obvious.  Then there is Ryan Zinke, who was supposed to protect public lands but instead opened up oil and gas leases at the Department of Interior, or the guy regulating Federal energy who denies that climate change is real, even though we can all see it with our own eyes. If you don't believe the science, you can at least believe your own experience. The weather is getting worse and weirder and more severe. He says carbon dioxide really isn't a pollutant at all.  So the nominees have been awful, but the policy is bad too. Republicans are trying to pull us out of the Paris Agreement that every other country in the world is part of. We are not even trying to lead on this planetary emergency, and it means that we give the leadership mantle to China to take the lead on how the world is going to fix this problem or make it worse, as if Americans should trust China to do what is best for our country.  Then there is the Republican effort to let polluting companies keep polluting. The whole reason the EPA exists is to make sure the air we breathe, the water we drink and swim in, the land we farm on and live on doesn't get polluted, but Republicans have taken control of the EPA to get rid of these protections, and they are telling the auto industry they no longer need to make cars that put less pollution in the air. They have gutted the Clean Power Plan so carbon pollution could be 12 times worse in the next decade--12 times worse in the next decade.  Researchers have found it would be better if we had no policy at all than if we do the things the Republicans want to do.  They have let energy companies off the hook for leaking methane and made it easier for super pollutants to leak into the air. Again, this is the kind of thing you might hear from a politician who is a little overheated, a little overly angry, maybe taking a few liberties with the truth.  This is literally what is happening. They literally put a coal lobbyist in charge of the EPA. That should be enough for someone on the other side to say: Gosh. I can't vote for a coal lobbyist to run the EPA. Now, I don't agree with the Democrats about climate change, but I can't pretend this thing doesn't happen to my home State. I can't pretend Alaska isn't melting or the fisheries aren't crashing or our farms aren't having great difficulty or that the floods in South Carolina and North Carolina and Florida aren't real, and so we can't put a coal lobbyist in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency.  There was a time when the EPA and environmental protection itself was not a partisan issue. Here we are in the U.S. Senate--which is the place to solve these kinds of problems over the course of this country's great history--and every time we come to the floor to talk about climate change, it is an empty Chamber on the Republican side. We have to do better as a country. We have to do better as a Senate. We have to solve climate change together. Future generations are counting on us to transcend partisanship and to have this great debate.  If Leader McConnell wants to bring a resolution, which he thinks is clever, to sort of divide Democrats, fine. We are not particularly worried about that. We are taking this opportunity to say: Great. Let's talk about climate change.  The first question to ask--the first question to ask--is, what is the Republican plan for climate change? Right now, the answer is very simple. They have no plan.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, today I am pleased to join with Senators Schatz, Merkley, Markey, and others who have spoken to highlight the need to act on climate change.  I said on the floor earlier this week that the Democrats may not yet agree on exactly how we must address climate change, but we all agree on at least three things: One, climate change is real; two, we as human beings are the primary cause of the climate crisis we face today, and it has been building for the last almost 100 years; and, three, the U.S. Congress--us, the House--should take immediate action to address the challenges of climate change.  That is why I am introducing a resolution today that says those three things: Climate change is real. Humans are leading to this crisis we face. We have an obligation in this body and the House to do something about it.  Democrats believe in our hearts and our minds that it is possible to have a healthy climate and a vibrant, growing economy, and anyone who says otherwise is preaching a false choice.  Sadly, with President Trump in the White House and this administration, many of our Republican friends across the aisle have chosen to ignore the clear science and threat that climate change poses to our children and to their children.  As we speak about climate change today, this Senate is considering the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead EPA. Under Mr. Wheeler's leadership, EPA is rolling back climate regulations that will lead to more carbon pollution in the air while increasing other air pollution that triggers asthma, lung disease, and, in some cases, death.  Mr. Wheeler claims these actions are needed to provide more business certainty. He believes industry is stuck in on old world order. I would just say to Andrew Wheeler, as Bob Dylan once said, ``the times they are a-changin.''  Things have changed a lot in the last 15 years. Industry knows where the future lies, and that future is in cleaner technologies. Companies are making investments now for the next 10 and 20 years down the road. They see where the global markets are going. They need to invest in clean energy or be left behind.  Yet, even when industries ask this administration to support climate policies that will help the bottom line of those businesses, in too many instances, Mr. Wheeler seems to turn a blind eye. In fact, there are policies that this administration could support today, right now; policies that would dramatically help our climate and our economy.  One of those policies is the ratification of something called the Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol. You say stuff like that, and my colleagues' eyes glaze over. So I want to take a minute to talk about what they mean.  The Montreal Protocol, ratified by the United States in 1988, is a global environmental agreement mainly focused on phasing down emissions that contributed to the hole in the ozone layer. It was not that long ago--about the time our pages here were born--that it was a burning issue.  Ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons--we call them CFCs for short--were often found in the coolants used to cool food in household refrigerators and the air-conditioners in our homes and in our cars. CFCs are also found in foams and solvents used in industrial processes.  If there was a poster child for a successful global agreement, I think the Montreal Protocol--which most people never heard of--has to be that poster child. This agreement has led to a 97-percent reduction in the global consumption of ozone-depleting substances with little, if any, economic disruption. Think about that.  Over the years, every administration since the Reagan administration has supported the Montreal Protocol and the four amendments associated with it.  However, it turns out a majority of the ozone-depleting substances are actually being replaced by something called HFCs, hydrofluorocarbons. Those HFCs are easy to use. They are efficient. They are safe for the ozone layer. That is good.  Unfortunately, there is a catch. The HFCs have a global warming potential that is thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. On the one hand, they are good for the ozone layer; on the other hand, they are a killer when it comes to carbon dioxide. So some really smart people decided to see what they could do about this, and what those smart people did is they came up with a follow-on product to HFCs.  It is estimated that left unchecked, HFCs could account for approximately 20 percent of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050, and that ain't good. So by using HFCs, we are fixing one global environmental problem--the hole in the ozone--but we are contributing to another, and that is just as serious.  To address this negative side effect, on October 15, 2016, in a place called Kigali, which is in Rwanda--that is why they call it the Kigali amendment or Kigali treaty--more than 170 countries agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol, including ours.  The goal of this agreement is to achieve more than an 80-percent reduction in global HFC production and utilization by 2047. It doesn't say you have to stop using it tomorrow. This is a phaseout and a phasedown. If we don't do anything by 2047, we will see an increase of about half a degree Celsius--that is almost a full degree Fahrenheit--in global warming by the end of this century. We can't afford to do that. Our planet can't afford to do that. Our kids, our grandchildren cannot afford for us to do that.  U.S. industry strongly supports the Kigali amendment because U.S. companies have already invested billions of dollars in order to be able to produce the next-generation technologies that are going to replace, over time, HFCs. Phasing down HFCs allows U.S. companies to capture a large portion of a global market that is--listen to this--$1 trillion in size, which will create 150,000 new direct and indirect American jobs in less than a decade.  These new jobs are expected to generate close to $39 billion dollars--$39 billion--in annual economic benefits for our country; again, in less than a decade.  Industry also believes ratification of the Kigali treaty will mitigate unfair Chinese dumping of HFCs in the United States, hurting our businesses.  Ratification of the Kigali amendment is a no-brainer, and even those who are skeptical about climate change ought to be able to admit that it would be great for U.S. competitiveness and good-paying American jobs.  This is a real win-win situation. If we don't seize the opportunity, we should have our heads examined. That is why we have some pretty strange bedfellows supporting the Kigali ratification.  There is a chart behind me. Among others, we have the National Association of Manufacturers, Natural Resources development folks, the spirit of enterprise, FreedomWorks, the American Chemistry Council, Business Roundtable, and Sierra Club."

                "speech":"Madam President, as strange as it seems, socialism is having a bit of a resurgence here in the Nation's Capital these days.  Why, you might ask, has this failed economic theory that is so destructive of individual freedom captured the attention of some of our friends in the Democratic Party? I admit, to me, it is somewhat of a mystery.  My guess is I am not the only one who assumed that every American has learned the lessons of history and that those lessons are common knowledge. Apparently not. One other possibility is that socialism is a stalking horse for other, less obvious goals. I will have more to say about what the Founders believed about the concentration of government power that would be needed to implement these utopian schemes at a later time. I also will return to the Senate floor at another time to talk about the well-funded efforts, including in the State of Texas, to advance the cause of socialism, unbeknownst to most of my fellow Texans.  Maybe self-identified socialists or democratic socialists--by the way, that is an impossible contradiction in terms. You can't be democratic and a socialist at the same time. Obviously, people put those two terms together to try to mask their true intentions.  Obviously, these self-identified democratic socialists have never learned what it is or what it stands for. Recent polling suggests that Americans have vastly different ideas about what socialism really means. A Gallup poll, for example, found that 23 percent of the people who responded understood that it means economic equality--though the definition of what equality looks like varies pretty significantly. About the same number of people said they didn't know or had no opinion of what socialism means. Roughly 17 percent understand it to mean government ownership or control of business and the economy.  There were a variety of answers, ranging from government-guaranteed benefits to communism, to people simply being social and getting along. That is what some people think socialism is. This confusion about what, exactly, socialism is has allowed its supporters to push this discredited idea back into the political mainstream.  The so-called democratic socialists are trying to convince the American people that bigger government and less liberty are the solutions to economic inequality. But they don't just want economic opportunity or equal opportunity; they want equal outcomes. They clearly want to put the government in charge of Americans' lives.  To be sure, they will not be honest about the means by which that equality would be accomplished under socialism. They use a lot of feel-good phrases to mask the consequences of their argument. They say things like ``give a voice to the voiceless'' or ``to achieve a more just society.'' What they don't tell you is that in order to redistribute economic benefits, you would have to marshal the power of the government to coerce the American people to give up the fruits of their labor in pursuit of socialist, utopian aims.  While socialists will not tell you what the government would have to do to force that redistribution, they like to point to Scandinavian countries as a model for socialism's success. But there are some problems with that.  They will say: Look at Denmark. They have free higher education, universal healthcare, and subsidized childcare, and they are doing great. So, they say, socialism works. But facts are stubborn things. For one, Denmark is not a socialist country. Just ask the Danish Prime Minister, who said:       Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is      a market economy.  The left argues: It is still a good model. We want that.  OK, so how are they paying for all of these programs? It is certainly not just from the top 1 percent of the wealthiest of Americans. It is the middle class too. Margaret Thatcher once said: ``The problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other people's money.''  Let's look at tax rates. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world. In the United States, tax revenue accounts for just over a quarter of the size of our economy. In Denmark, it is 50 percent--or double.  Let's also compare our two countries. The population of the country of Denmark is roughly 1/60th the population of the United States. In terms of landmass, it is about 16,000 square miles. Texas is almost 17 times the size of Denmark.  So if the model used in Denmark is, one, not socialism and, two, unaffordable, let's instead look for a better example of a country that has embraced socialism. I would suggest Venezuela would be a good candidate.  In the late 1990s, then-Presidential Candidate Hugo Chavez delivered impassioned speeches promising to lead Venezuela into a socialist paradise. He talked about the country's wealth being stolen by evil capitalists and greedy corporations and promised hope and change if he was elected. That sounds similar to some of the snake oil being sold by a number of radical Democrats today. By the way, you don't see caravans of people attempting to immigrate to socialist countries like Venezuela. It is just the opposite.  We now know that Chavez's promises were empty and dangerous, and while Venezuela certainly saw a lot of change, it wasn't the kind they wanted or the kind they expected. The government took over businesses; they shut down free markets; and they suppressed free speech. As a result, one of the richest countries in the world is now among the poorest. Basic commodities like food, medicine, and water are in short supply; freedom of the press has disappeared; crime rates have skyrocketed; and millions have fled.  Of course, it is no surprise that self-proclaimed socialists in the United States refuse to accept this as an example of socialism. But this is the truth. That is why socialism must be soundly rejected.  Sir Winston Churchill, who had an incredible gift for words, once said:       The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of      blessings. The inherent virtue of Socialism is the equal      sharing of miseries.  Clearly, misery would be a result of a current fad celebrating socialism, and we must firmly and clearly reject it.  In a society like ours, based on the free enterprise system, business owners compete for business and make decisions based on what the customer wants and needs, and this helps keep the cost of living low while offering consumers choice.  Competition and free enterprise are the opposite of centrally planned and administered socialist economies and the only economic system compatible with individual liberty.  In a socialist country, the government owns or controls everything. If you don't like it or insist on going your own way, you will be squished like a bug. Socialism forces citizens to be submissive to the government's plan--a far cry from the freedoms and liberties promised under our Constitution.  Most Americans don't want the government to run their lives. They want less government, which is to say they want more freedom. So while things like free healthcare or free higher education or free housing sound pretty good superficially, they are a fantasy and part of the agenda to move the United States toward a socialist, government-controlled economy.  Under our free enterprise system, people work to earn their living. The harder you work, the more you benefit and the better you can provide for yourself and your family. That is something we call the American dream. But with socialism, that kind of motivation doesn't exist at all. Why would you put in the extra effort? Why would you work longer hours when you will receive the same pay and benefits as everybody else? Why would you pursue an advanced degree and pour your heart into researching new medical cures when you know, at the end of the day, the person who chooses to do nothing will receive the same benefits you do? Well, you wouldn't. That is why socialism doesn't work.  In a recent Washington Post column, George Will defined today's understanding of socialism as this:       Almost everyone will be nice to almost everyone, using      money taken from a few. This means having government      distribute, according to its conception of equity, the wealth      produced by capitalism.  The problem is, as he said, the government will take and take until eventually there is nothing more to take. Once that happens, the economy will tank; jobs will dry up; taxes will get higher to pay for the benefits promised; and those utopian sentiments will not feel quite so good anymore.  The enemy of socialism isn't greed. It is experience. That is why there are no socialist success stories. Venezuela, the Soviet Union, Ethiopia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania--time and again, we have seen socialism fail. That has been the universal experience.  As President Trump said in Miami last week:       Socialism promises prosperity, but it delivers poverty.      Socialism promises unity, but it delivers hatred and it      delivers division. Socialism promises a better future, but it      always returns to the darkest chapters of the past.  Slapping the word ``democratic'' in front of the word ``socialism'' doesn't make it any less radical or any less terrifying. In fact, democracy and socialism are at war with each other.  This is not about lifting up the poor. It is about taking our freedom away and turning it over to our government overlords and taskmasters.  As so many seem to have forgotten the lessons of history, I plan to return to the Senate floor to discuss this disturbing trend further and remind the American people why socialism is the enemy, not a friend, of our country."

                "speech":"Madam President, I say to our colleagues that I stand before you today as a Vietnam veteran--5 years of naval service during the hot war in Southeast Asia, trying to make sure that the force of communism was stopped. I served another 18 years beyond that, right to the end of the Cold War, as a naval flight officer and retired as a Navy captain.  I am not a socialist. I am somebody who cares deeply about this planet. I am someone who believes it is possible to have clean air, clean water, better public health, and to foster economic growth.  As it turns out, there are a lot of companies in this country that believe the same thing. They believe the same thing. A lot of them build cars, trucks, and vans. They want a 50-State deal on fuel efficiency standards, CAFE standards, and tailpipe standards. They want a 50-State deal so they don't have to build a car for 13 or 14 different States and then a different kind of car or truck for the rest of the country. They don't want to do that. They want certainty and predictability so they can build one model for one car. They want to be able to be successful in competing in the world marketplace in the next 10, 20, or 30 years.  We need someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who believes that it is possible to have cleaner air and, frankly, to foster economic growth in the auto companies. That is what the auto companies want. They are not socialists. They are free-marketers.  There is something called HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons. It is a terrible pollutant for the environment. It is 1,000 times worse than carbon for our global warming challenges. There are a bunch of American businesses that have new technology to replace HFCs. They want to be able not just to develop it, but they want to able to sell it all over the world. The marketplace is $1 trillion, and we are holding it back.  Unfortunately, the person whom we are going to be voting on here today to be our EPA Administrator is part of holding us back because he will not agree to a treaty that the administration wants to put forward. It is crazy.  Those companies that developed the follow-on products to HFCs--Honeywell, Chemours, and others--are not socialists. They are business people. They want a piece of the international market, and they want to do good things for the climate at the same time.  I just want to say to my colleagues: We can do both. We can have clean air. We can have clean water. We can have strong economic growth. We need somebody running the EPA who actually believes in that too. I am sorry to say here today that right now I don't believe it is Andrew Wheeler, and I say that with no joy.  Thank you very much."

                "speech":"Madam President, throughout the country and in the great State of Illinois, a host of environmental issues are plaguing Americans. From air pollution, to groundwater contamination, to the increases in climate change-related harm that we are already facing, there is no more crucial time to have strong national leadership on environmental issues than right now. However, in the midst of all these issues comes the nomination of Andrew Wheeler--a former lobbyist for corporate polluters--to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.  If there is one major thing we have learned from the Clean Air Act, it is that regulations save lives and money. Regulations that ensure clean air mean fewer premature deaths and health issues, as well as fewer asthma attacks in children and health-related missed work days. However, the EPA under this administration that is now led by Acting Administrator Wheeler, consistently works to roll back clean air and water rules. This exposes the most vulnerable members of our society--including children and the elderly--to toxic and deadly chemicals. The people in Illinois are no exception. We are facing several environmental issues in Illinois that require immediate action by the EPA, and so far, I am not satisfied that EPA is doing everything it can and should be doing under Mr. Wheeler's leadership.  The Sterigenics facility is causing is a public health threat in Willowbrook, IL due to emissions from cancer-causing ethylene oxide. The EPA's own risk assessment from 2016, showed that ethylene oxide exposure increases the risk of cancer more than what was previously thought. However, given this information, the EPA has still not taken sufficient actions to protect people of Willowbrook who are exposed to this gas. Concerns about ethylene oxide exposure is not limited to the people of Willowbrook--it is also of concern to the people of Gurnee and Waujkegan, IL who also have plants that use ehtylene oxide in the middle of their towns. Every time I have spoken with Acting Administrator Wheeler about this issue, I have been disappointed by the lack of urgency to do anything more than monitor and collect more data. When it comes to the facilities in Gurnee and Waukegan, the EPA won't even commit to monitor and collect data, even though I have joined my colleague Senator Duckworth in requesting that monitoring begin immediately. The EPA is 4 years overdue to begin the process to promulgate new standards for this gas, even though they know the increased cancer risk. So I, along with my colleague Senator Duckworth and my colleagues in the House, introduced legislation to require the EPA to promulgate new rules for ethylene oxide. However, the EPA's failure to act to limit toxic chemicals being emitted into neighborhoods does not end with ethylene oxide. There is manganese pollution on the Southeast side of Chicago. Manganese exposure results in serious neurological effects, such as learning difficulties, lower IQ scores in children, and manganese poisoning--a condition that resembles Parkinson's disease. There are several facilities on the Southeast side of Chicago that emit manganese, and EPA is now monitoring these facilities after my colleague Senator Duckworth and I pressed EPA to do so. These facilities contaminate both the air that people breathe and the soil that children play on.  Although the EPA knows how dangerous this neurotoxin is and how high the concentrations are, they will not commit to strengthening manganese standards or take immediate action to clean up sites with soil contamination. We need someone at the EPA that will be aggressive in enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.  We also need an EPA Administrator who recognizes how urgent it is to address climate change. The Trump administration's own Department of Defense issued a report last month identifying national security threats to defense missions, operations, and installations, due to climate change. Yet Acting Administrator Wheeler continues to undermine independent science for climate change by appointing members to the EPA's Scientific Advisory Board who are biased by industry or actively deny that climate change is a problem. How can we expect the EPA to lead efforts to address climate change if its leadership doesn't believe it requires immediate action?  I would also like to mention one more thing before I close. This administration promised farmers, biorefineries, and fuels stations that they would ensure stations could sell E15 fuels this summer. The EPA is coming close to failing to fulfil that promise. I hope the EPA will work with me to ensure stations are able to sell E15 fuels this summer.  We need someone leading the EPA who will put the health and well-being of the people of this country above the profits of corporate polluters. We need someone who is willing to protect families and communities from toxic chemicals in our air and water by fully enforcing the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. And we need someone who will lead the charge to address climate change. I am not convinced that Acting Administrator Wheeler will do these things. As a result, I cannot support his nomination. I hope he proves me wrong."

                "speech":"Madam President, I rise today to express my opposition to confirming Andrew Wheeler to serve as Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  His lobbying activities and tenure, first as Deputy, then as Acting Administrator, show that he should not be leading the EPA in a permanent capacity.  We are at a crossroads for action on climate change. The United Nations issued a special report in October, warning of the catastrophic consequences of allowing global warming to surpass 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The report warned that human activity has already caused about 1 degree of warming and that we need to drastically cut emissions--45 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050--to stay below 1.5 degrees.  The EPA is the strongest institution we have in the United States to combat climate change in terms of technical expertise and legal authority. Unfortunately, I fear that, if the EPA remains under the leadership of Andrew Wheeler, it will continue dismantling critical regulations and rolling back previous efforts to address climate change.  Andrew Wheeler is a former coal and fossil fuel lobbyist. Despite a duty to serve the public's interest, he has instead worked to push a counterproductive agenda of deregulation at the EPA.  During Mr. Wheeler's EPA tenure, the Trump administration has aggressively moved to undermine numerous greenhouse gas emission regulations. This includes President Obama's landmark Clean Power Plan, performance standards for new power plants, and methane emission standards for the oil and gas industry.  I am most concerned that Andrew Wheeler is overseeing the Trump administration's efforts to roll back our national program for motor vehicle emission standards, an issue that I have worked on for decades.  Under the current program, fuel economy standards for new cars and SUVs are set to exceed 50 miles per gallon by 2025. To date, these standards have saved 550 million barrels of oil, $65 billion in fuel costs for American families, and 250 million metric tons of carbon dioxide.  The success of these standards comes, in part, from the fact that they have been implemented as a single, coordinated national program under the authority of the EPA, the Department of Transportation, and the State of California.  The Department of Transportation implements the Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act, which was signed into law in 2007 following a bipartisan legislative effort over the course of many years. I was proud to work together with our former colleague Olympia Snowe of Maine and many others from both parties to strengthen the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards for the first time in three decades.  This law requires fuel economy standards to increase by at least 10 miles per gallon by 2020. Beyond 2020, the law requires standards to be set at the maximum feasible level based on available technology, which the administration is trying to avoid doing for 2022-2026.  For its part, the EPA implements complementary vehicle emission standards under the Clean Air Act. That law also recognizes California's longstanding authority to regulate its own air pollution and allows other States to choose to follow California's standards in lieu of Federal requirements, as 13 States have now done.  Today these standards are collectively implemented as a single national program under a 2012 agreement between the Department of Transportation, the EPA, and the State of California that applies through model year 2025.  Unfortunately, the Trump administration is working to tear up that agreement and weaken Federal standards starting in 2022. Last week, the administration announced it would refuse to negotiate with California to salvage this program. Instead of seeking consensus, the EPA, overseen by Mr. Wheeler, is proposing to challenge California's longstanding authority. These actions are unjustified and will only create chaos and uncertainty for the automobile market.  Under Mr. Wheeler's watch, the Trump administration has also continued to roll back or undermine many other important EPA environmental health and safety regulations.  From attempts to undermine effective Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, to evading the EPA's commitments to set safe drinking water standards, to failing to fully implement the Toxic Substances Control Act, it is clear that Mr. Wheeler will only continue his efforts to dismantle the EPA from within.  I was a proud supporter of the bipartisan Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, which passed in 2016. This bill amends and updates the Toxic Substances Control Act, which is the Nation's primary chemicals management law. Thousands of Californians rely on it to safeguard against exposure to toxic chemicals we encounter every day.  EPA is charged with protecting all Americans from undue and harmful exposure to existing and newly introduced chemicals. However, under the Trump administration, the EPA's safety reviews of toxic substances has fallen far short of the intent of this sweeping, bipartisan toxic chemical reform legislation.  One example of a chemical that I am very concerned about is asbestos. As a result of the administration's lack of action, my colleagues in the Senate and I introduced legislation in 2017 that would have amended the Toxic Substances Control Act to require the EPA to identify and assess all forms of asbestos and ultimately ban this known carcinogen.  This bill was named after Alan Reinstein, who passed away in 2006 at the age of 66 from mesothelioma, a disease caused by exposure to asbestos. Delays in banning asbestos have meant that as many as 15,000 Americans die each year from exposure.  During Wheeler's tenure, the EPA has resisted calls to eliminate exemptions for asbestos in the current Chemical Data Reporting rule, a reporting requirement under the Toxic Substances Control Act, to comply with its mandate to prevent unreasonable risks to health and the environment presented by asbestos.  Despite knowing the health risks for decades, asbestos is still used in a wide variety of construction materials that the public unwittingly comes into contact with every day.  Andrew Wheeler's tenure at the EPA, both as Deputy Administrator for the EPA and as Acting Administrator, has shown a clear disregard for the EPA's mission to protect the public and the environment. I urge all of my colleagues to oppose his confirmation.  Thank you."

                "speech":"Thank you very much, Madam President.  Madam President, we are going to vote in just a few minutes to confirm Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. There is no one better to serve in this role, and I would know. Andrew worked for me for 14 years in both my personal office as well as in my capacity as chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee.  He was with the committee back when President Trump nominated Andrew as Deputy Administrator. I said: There is no one more qualified. There is no one more qualified anywhere in America to handle this job than Andrew Wheeler.  He has been Acting Administrator for the last 7 months. Let's keep in mind that he was the most qualified person 7 months ago, and now he has had 7 months on the job, and he has done a really great job. He has been the Acting Administrator.  It didn't really start when he came on board with any of the governmental Agencies. He has always been concerned about nature and the environment. The guy was an Eagle Scout.  In fact, I remember the discussions of people who were with him when he was actually climbing Mount Kilimanjaro. It was with a group of people who were interested in nature and the environment. This came early on with him. So he has the ability to lead the Agency.  I have always enjoyed following his career. After earning a law degree at Washington University in St. Louis, he joined the EPA as a special assistant in the Agency's Pollution Prevention and Toxics Office in 1991. I am talking about 30 years ago. This guy has been there for a long time. For all practical purposes, he has grown up in that particular discipline.  He was an EPA employee for 4 years, transitioning to the George H. W. Bush administration and then the Clinton administration after that, where he earned three Bronze Medals for commendable service along the way.  By the way, I doubt if there are too many people in this Chamber who know what that is. So I am going to read it to you.  The Bronze Medal is given for ``significant service or achievements in support of the Agency's mission or for demonstration of outstanding accomplishments in supervision and leadership.''  That is Andrew Wheeler. He received three of those.  I know you have heard a lot of people opposing him. Regretfully, there are a lot of people opposed simply for the reason that this is a nominee of the President. We went through this with Mr. Kavanaugh. We heard all of these things, and people now look back, and many of them regret that they said the things that they said.  It is awfully hard to be critical of Andrew because he is such a nice guy.  He left the Agency. He brought the sense of service and leadership with him to the U.S. Senate, where I had a front-row seat because he worked for me for 14 years.  He just did really tremendous work. There were never any complaints about him. He knew what he was doing. Again, with a 31-year background, there is nothing that he doesn't know about the mission.  Andrew started in my personal office as chief counsel and transitioned to staff director for a Senate subcommittee. I was a subcommittee chairman at the time on the subcommittee called the Clean Air, Climate Change, Wetlands, and Nuclear Safety Subcommittee. He was the one who did all the work, and I took the credit, but it worked.  In 2003, when I became the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Andrew became our chief counsel. Over the next 6 years, he would eventually become staff director and we worked closely together on highway bills, energy bills, the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, and the Clear Skies Act.  I can remember when this was taking place because someone who was a very close friend of mine and is no longer here, Barbara Boxer from California, worked together on these things. It was really kind of funny. Philosophically, we were opposed to each other as much as two people could be, but we accomplished everything. We accomplished the things that other people were not able to accomplish.  It is only natural that the President would nominate Andrew to be the Deputy Director at that time of the EPA. That was last April. He was confirmed in a bipartisan vote.  I will always remember that he gave a speech over at the EPA. It was kind of a welcome speech at that time. That was the day that he was confirmed as Deputy Director of the EPA. I think every single employee was in there, really, to kind of pay homage to him. It is a big deal. Here is a guy who started 30 years ago at the bottom. He is just a normal person in the bureaucracy, and all of a sudden--not all of a sudden, it took him almost 30 years to do it--he climbs up to become Deputy Director. So he was really a model. He was a model to those 200 or 300 people.  Andrew didn't even know this as he was making his initial speech, but I watched the looks on their faces, and the model that he was for them was that there is room at the top. Here is a guy who climbed all the way up, and he reached the top.  He knows what it takes to ensure that our environment is cared for within the laws passed by Congress. He will ensure that all stakeholders are heard, and he will provide certainty and stability for the regulated community. That is a switch.  One of the reasons I ran for Congress in the first place many years ago was the fact that I was a builder and developer and I was overregulated. I know what it is like firsthand. He will be a good steward of the environment without punishing our States, without punishing our farmers, and without punishing our job creators just for the sake of it. Those days are behind us.  Andrew has worked on these issues for his entire 28-year career, and I am honored that he chose to spend half of his 14 years working for me. So I have directly benefited from his service. The U.S. Senate has benefited from his leadership, and now America will benefit as well.  Let's vote Andrew in and put him to work."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in a few minutes, we will be voting on the President's nomination of John Ryder, of Memphis, to be a member of the Board of the Tennessee Valley Authority.  To those of us in the seven State region that the TVA serves, it is a very important institution. Its job is to provide large amounts of reliable, low-cost electricity, which is the basis for how we live and how we work. It has a lot to do with our ability to attract jobs. Its job is to provide that energy in a clean way so we can see our mountains and so we meet the emissions standards in our metropolitan areas that allow us to attract and grow more jobs.  The TVA is fulfilling its mission very well. It is heading toward a position in which it will be about 40-percent nuclear in its production of electricity, about 20 percent in natural gas, and about 20 percent in coal or a little less than that. It will have pollution control equipment on all of its coal plants. Most of the rest is hydroelectric power, and a little bit is renewable. In short, it has one of the cleanest portfolios in the country, and it is continuing to do that and is producing a lot of low-cost, reliable electricity.  We are very fortunate to be in a region in which, as we look down the road 5, 10, or 15 years, we will be able to say to people who are thinking of moving themselves to Tennessee or moving their businesses to Tennessee or growing them there that they will be able to get a lot of reliable, low-cost electricity--all that they need. In addition to that, they will be able to see the Smoky Mountains because the air is a lot cleaner now that they have such a clean portfolio.  So John Ryder's appointment is a very important appointment, and he is a well-qualified man for that position. He is one of Tennessee's best known lawyers and has been for a long time. Since the late 1980s, he has been listed as one of Tennessee's best lawyers. He is well respected by everyone who knows him.  Senator Corker and I recommended him to President Trump, and we know him well. Senator Blackburn, who is Senator Corker's successor, has a high regard for John Ryder. All of us appreciate his willingness to serve, and we look forward to the voice vote we are going to have in a few minutes that will place him on TVA's Board. The Board has just selected a new chief executive officer. TVA is the largest public utility in the United States, perhaps in the world. It is an important assignment, and it is one I am delighted to recommend him for.  There is one other thing, but I will not dwell on this because I spoke on this Monday night. Unfortunately, Mr. Ryder has been on the Senate's calendar for 9 months. He was nominated by President Trump a year ago. The problem has not been with Mr. Ryder because, as I said, President Trump nominated him after he was thoroughly vetted by the FBI. The Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee considered him, had a hearing, and reported him unanimously to the floor. Yet, for 9 months, he waited there.  One reason is, the Democrats have consistently obstructed the ability of Senator McConnell and the Republican majority to help President Trump form his government. The Democrats have required 128 times that Senator McConnell, the majority leader, file cloture motions to cut off debate to advance a nomination like Mr. Ryder's.  Now, this is not a Cabinet position. This is not a lifetime judge. This is the part-time Board of an important institution. He is one of 1,200 Presidential nominees that any President has who is subject to confirmation by advice and consent. It is the kind of nomination by which, if a committee unanimously reports it to the Senate, we will normally approve it by voice vote. Yet, on this vote, Senator McConnell was forced to file cloture a week ago. Then we had to wait an intervening day. Only then could we come to this vote.  This is not the way the Senate is supposed to work, and this obstruction has to stop. Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford have introduced a resolution, which has been reported to the Senate by the rules committee, that would cause us to adopt a rule very much like the one we adopted in 2013, when I worked with a large number of Democrats and Republicans for the sole purpose of making it easier for President Obama--and his successors--to promptly confirm the men and women whom he chose to form a government.  It received 78 votes. What we did at that time was simply say: You still keep the cloture motion, and you still wait an intervening day if you need it, but we reduce the postcloture time--not for Supreme Court Justices, not for circuit judges--simply for sub-Cabinet members and for district judges. We would reduce sub-Cabinet members to 8 hours and district judges to 2 hours.  On Monday night, I invited my Democratic friends to work with me in 2019 the way I worked with them in 2013. In a bipartisan way, let's make sure the Senate can do what it has historically done--to have promptly considered and voted up or down, with 51 votes, the nominees of any President of the United States for the 1,200 positions that form the government.  There have been some conversations. I hope Senator Blunt and Senator Lankford will continue to have those conversations with the Democratic Members, but there are nine Democratic Senators, by my count, who are seeking to be the next President of the United States. I hope they can look 20 months down the road and realize that just one Republican Senator could do to them, if one of them were to become President, what the Democrats have done to President Trump. It would be very difficult for the next Democratic President, if there were to be one, to form a government. We don't want that to happen. That diminishes the advice and consent role of the Senate. It fills up the government with appointees who are acting and whom we don't know, and they are not really accountable to us. That is not the way this place is supposed to work.  So I renew my invitation to my Democratic friends to work with me the way a number of us worked with them in 2011, in 2012, and in 2013. Let's change the rules in the right way. Let's basically adopt virtually the same rule we adopted in 2013 and allow this President and any President to get prompt consideration and up-or-down votes of their nominees.  I congratulate Mr. Ryder on his confirmation. I am grateful for his willingness to serve, and I am sorry he had to wait so long for the opportunity. The people of Tennessee and the seven State region will be much better off for his service within this important institution.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the confirmation of John Ryder, as a member of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority, occur at this time."

                "speech":"Mr. President, President Trump has been in Vietnam this week, meeting with the North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un. I applaud the President for his efforts to improve the U.S. relationship with North Korea.  There is not a more difficult relationship anywhere in the world at this time than that relationship. But I am glad he chose not to seek a deal just for the sake of a deal.  As he returns from his summit with the North Korean leader and turns his attention back home, I want to make a respectful suggestion, and that is this: that President Trump ask his lawyers to take a second look at existing funding authorities that the President has to consider construction of the 234 miles of border wall that do not require a formal declaration of a national emergency.  I support what the President wants to do on border security, but I do not support the way he has been advised to do it. It is unnecessary and unwise to turn a border crisis into a constitutional crisis about separation of powers when the President already has congressional funding authority to build the 234 miles of border wall that he requested in his January 6 letter to the Senate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record following my remarks the text of the President's January 6 letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee.  Mr. President, there has never been an instance in which a President of the United States has asked for funding, Congress has refused it, and the President has then used the National Emergency Act to justify spending the money anyway.  If President Trump can build a wall when Congress has refused to provide the funding, then the next President can declare a national emergency and tear the wall down or declare climate change an emergency and stop oil exports and offshore drilling. There is no limit to the imagination of what the next leftwing President could do to harm our country with this precedent.  After an American revolution against a King, our Founders chose not to create a Chief Executive who could tax the people and spend their money any way he chose. The Constitution gave that responsibility exclusively to a Congress elected by the people, and every one of us U.S. Senators has taken an oath to support that Constitution.  Separation of powers is a crucial constitutional imperative that goes to the very heart of our freedom.  I don't know how the late Justice Antonin Scalia would have decided a case on this matter, but I do know what he said about separation of powers, and this was what Justice Scalia said:       Every tin horn dictator in the world today . . . has a Bill      of Rights. That's not what makes us free. . . . What has made      us free is our Constitution. . . . The word ``constitution''      . . . means structure. That's why . . . the framers debated      not the Bill of Rights . . . but rather the structure of the      federal government. The genius of the American constitutional      system is the dispersal of power. Once power is centralized      in one person, or one part [of our government], a Bill of      Rights is just words on paper.  That was Justice Scalia.  The President can avoid this dangerous precedent completely. He can use the congressional funding authority he already has to build the 234 miles of wall that he asked Congress to approve in the January 6 letter that I submitted for the Record.  Here is how this would work. On January 6 of this year--last month--in his letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee, the President requested $5.7 billion to build 234 miles of new physical barrier on the southern border.  Then, on February 14, a couple of weeks ago, Congress passed the Homeland Security appropriations bill, which provided $1.375 billion to build 55 miles that the President had asked for.  On February 15, the day he signed the Homeland Security appropriations bill, President Trump announced that he would use two additional sources of funds that had already been approved by Congress, which could be used to fund the border wall.  The first was $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund. The second was up to $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities and to block drug-smuggling corridors across international boundaries.  The President is authorized to do this because of a provision in law that allows him to transfer up to $4 billion among the accounts of the Department of Defense. That is $4 billion in a Department of Defense budget of about $600 billion.  These three sources of funding that I just mentioned add up to about $4.5 billion or $1.2 billion less than the $5.7 billion that the President requested in his January 6 letter.  So where does he get the rest of the money? He can get it by transferring $3.7 billion instead of $2.5 billion from the Department of Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities. Then the President would be able to build the 234 miles of wall he requested on January 6, and he would not need to declare a national emergency.  To be specific, this means the President would use $1.375 billion from the Homeland Security appropriations bill plus $601 million from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund plus $3.7 billion from the Department of Defense accounts to support counterdrug activities, which would add up to equal his full $5.7 billion request to build 234 miles of border wall.  If my analysis is incorrect, I hope that the President's lawyers will tell me.  Using funds already approved by Congress avoids the constitutional crisis of separation of powers. Using funds already approved by Congress avoids establishing a dangerous precedent, which could be misused by subsequent Presidents. Using funds already approved by Congress avoids taking money from military construction projects specifically approved by Congress for such activities as military barracks and hospitals. And using funds already approved by Congress avoids months or years of litigation, which could make it unlikely that the full 234 miles are ever built.  It may be a couple of weeks before the Senate votes on a resolution regarding the national emergency declaration, so we don't know yet exactly what we will be voting on. There is time for the President's lawyers to take another look and determine whether we can both build the 234 miles of border wall that the President has asked for and avoid this dangerous precedent. Then the Senate could both support the President's border request and be faithful to our oath to support a Constitution that creates separation of powers as a crucial check on Executive power that goes to the very heart of our freedom.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: "

                "speech":"Mr. President, just a couple of short weeks ago, we finally finished the fiscal year 2019 appropriations bills, and I greatly appreciate those who worked with us to get that done.  I want to talk today about the need to reach a new 2-year budget deal. We have to do that so the Appropriations Committee could then begin to work in earnest on the fiscal year 2020 bills.  We have shown that we can move the appropriations bills quickly, but we have to have the budget deal. In fact, unless we will get a budget deal, sequestration returns in fiscal year 2020. That would mean steep cuts in programs that invest in America and support working families.  It means we would have to make cuts in our defense programs for the next fiscal year--cuts of $71 billion. This is real money. There would be a 10-percent cut in funding to support our troops and to invest in military readiness.  It would also require that we cut $55 billion for nondefense programs in the next fiscal year. That is a 9-percent cut. The reality is, it means less investment in infrastructure, education, housing, or agricultural programs. It means less money for veterans' healthcare, protecting our environment, or combating the opioid epidemic.  These cuts are not just hypothetical numbers on a piece of paper. They affect real people and real families. They affect people in my State. They affect the people in the State of the distinguished Presiding Officer. They affect people in the 50 States represented by all 100 of us.  Of course, the worst part about that is the cuts will come at the same time we are facing significant increases in important programs that we have no control over.  For example, we have to fund the decennial census. The Constitution requires us to have this census, and we have to fund it by $4 billion if we are going to follow what the Constitution of the United States requires us to do in conducting the 2020 census.  We have all talked about veterans' healthcare. We have had a significant increase in the healthcare costs for veterans, and we have to have significant increases in the budget if we are going to adequately fund their health.  The VA MISSION Act, which provides additional private care options for veterans, becomes effective in June of this year. That is going to cost at least an additional $3 billion, and estimates could climb significantly higher. That is on top of the $3 billion increase for VA medical care that we have already enabled through advance appropriations.  Then we are going to need an additional $1 billion to ensure that an estimated 5 million people who receive affordable housing assistance can stay in their homes. In addition to these increased costs, we expect to lose nearly $4 billion in receipts and cost savings in other programs compared to this year.  This may sound like just a whole lot of numbers. It is more than that. It means we have $15 billion right off the bat that we must account for above this year's levels. Of course, I am sure there will be more increases that we will have to address.  As vice chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I know how hard Chairman Shelby and I worked with Republicans and Democrats to get through the bills we had this past year. We got them done, but it was not easy staying within levels. We have to have a 2-year budget deal. We have to negotiate it now. If we wait until the very last second to pass these bills, it will cost the taxpayers a lot more money because the Departments cannot plan. We are not going to bury our heads in the sand and pretend it is going to fix itself.  Of course, again, in the Appropriations Committee, we try to work in a bipartisan way. But we cannot responsibly do our job in the absence of cap levels that allow us to meet the needs of the American people.  Again, this is not just an accounting issue. This is the security and the well-being of the greatest Nation on Earth. It is not rhetoric; it is reality.  The budget deal has to be based on parity if we are going to pass it. It has to have equal treatment for defense and nondefense programs, as we have had in the past.  We have to invest on both sides of the ledger if we are going to create a strong national defense, a strong economy, and a healthy citizenry of the United States.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to all Senators that was received yesterday from over 300 retired admirals and generals who agree with this premise.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: These admirals and generals, many of whom I know and a lot of whom I do not, have been here with Republican and Democratic administrations, but they are all people who have served our Nation and care about our Nation. They are part of a coalition called Mission: Readiness, Council for a Strong America. They call on Congress to negotiate balanced investments in both defense and nondefense programs.  They wrote: ``As members of Mission: Readiness, we recognize the fact that the strength of our military--and our Nation--is dependent on the strength of our people.''  We have certainly seen this. You can go back to the time of World War II, when Harry Truman found that we could not find the people we needed in our military because of things like malnutrition or a lack of education; we needed to improve the nutrition programs in our schools. This is not rhetoric; it is reality.  These admirals and generals want a strong United States of America, just as I do and just as every single Member of this body--of either party--wants.  If the press reports are accurate, the President is planning to send up a budget on March 11 that not only fails to provide a constructive path forward, but it is going to be dead on arrival. If press reports are accurate, the President will, yet again, propose deep cuts to nondefense programs, even though Congress has rejected President Trump's cuts for the last 2 fiscal years. Every Republican and every Democrat knows that you have to have a balance between defense and nondefense programs.  President Trump also proposes large increases for defense programs, paid for using a budget gimmick that his own Acting Chief of Staff, Mick Mulvaney, would rail against when he was in Congress. He says he will move large portions of the defense base budget into the Overseas Contingency Operation, or OCO, account so that it will not count against the budget caps. Mick Mulvaney and most Republicans and Democrats have said we cannot do this. It is not a recipe for success.  OCO is meant for costs associated with military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. It is there to address crises overseas. It supports our men and women deployed and in harm's way.  The OCO account should not be used as a slush fund to pay for the everyday operations of the Department of Defense or to avoid a real debate on the budget caps.  To suggest we should move billions in the base defense budget into OCO at a time when the President is actively reducing our troop presence overseas shows what a disingenuous move it is.  I went back in my notes, and I found a letter written by then-Congressman Mick Mulvaney--now the acting Chief of Staff for President Trump. He wrote this in March of 2014. It is strikingly relevant today, 5 years later. Then-Congressman Mulvaney wrote a letter signed by numerous Members. He opposed a $10 billion increase in OCO, calling it is a ``misuse'' of funds and an attempt to ``circumvent the caps'' for things unrelated to overseas combat at a time when war operations were ``winding down.'' He opposed the gimmick. He argued for greater transparency and discipline in the budget process.  He said he would not want any President--well, of course, in that case, it was President Obama--to have this power. Now he is Acting Chief of Staff of another President, and we are told the President may propose an increase of $105 billion, more than doubling OCO funding, as we are withdrawing troops. That is not the way forward.  Let's have an honest conversation, Republicans and Democrats together, about our needs as a nation. We have to do the hard work to set new caps. It is not easy. Every one of us will have to cast difficult votes. Well, so what? We are elected to a 6-year term. There is not a single Member of this body who, at one time or another during their campaigns, did not say something to the effect of ``I am willing to cast tough votes.''  Well, let us have it, this onerous conversation. Let us do the hard work to set new caps. Let us cast those difficult votes. Let us show the people who elected us they did the right thing. Let us invest in the programs. Let us strengthen our military, grow our economy, improve our infrastructure, and build the future of this country we love. Let us not use a budget gimmick to frustrate that debate. Trust me, the American people will see through that kind of a gimmick. I am ready to have those conversations. I want to move forward with the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bills. Let's get the work done the American people sent us here to do. If we have to stay a few evenings and if we have to stay a few weekends, let's do it. It is for the greatest Nation on Earth. Let's do it. I urge leadership on both sides of the aisle, in both Chambers of Congress, to begin these negotiations now.  Then we have to take up, with urgency, a disaster package. In the last 2 years, we have had the deadliest disaster seasons in recent memory--Hurricanes Michael, Florence, Irma, and Maria, the California wildfires, volcanic eruptions in Hawaii, and typhoons along the Pacific coast. These communities, States, and territories need our help.  When Tropical Storm Irene hit Vermont in 2011, I found out firsthand how devastating natural disasters can be. Roads were washed away, towns and villages were cut off from vital services, and people's homes were destroyed.  The day after Irene, I went around the State of Vermont with our Governor and with the head of our National Guard in a helicopter, landing in small towns. Many times the only way you could get into these towns was by helicopter because roads were gone and the bridges were gone.  You would see bridges, like a child's toy, twisted and a mile from where it was supposed to be. A farmhouse that had been on the north side of the river was now upside down on the south side of the river. We were in the middle of the State, and we knew it was critical. The Federal Government provided assistance to help recovery because we are part of the United States of America.  The people of Puerto Rico and others that have been so badly damaged, these are Americans. We should stand together to help them. I am sorry we were not able to reach agreement to include a disaster package in the fiscal year 2019 minibus we passed just 2 weeks ago. We were so close to an agreement on a package--so very close, Republicans and Democrats alike. It would have addressed the needs of all impacted communities.  It broke down because the President insisted we eliminate disaster assistance for Puerto Rico. I guess he thought tossing rolls of paper towels for the people is good enough. Puerto Rico is part of the United States. It is not, as the White House described it, an island surrounded by water, I guess, as compared to those other islands. It is a part of the United States. These are American people. They have served in our military. They help us in our medical facilities. They are Americans, and they cannot be left out.  Hurricanes Maria and Irma--they had two hurricanes--devastated Puerto Rico. They destroyed the island's homes and infrastructure. They caused the deaths of an estimated 2,975 people. It was one of the deadliest hurricanes our country has ever seen, certainly in my lifetime.  Now, we provided Puerto Rico assistance in past disaster bills, but they have so many unaddressed needs that have to be met. Many people, even after the hurricane, are still living in temporary housing. Roads, bridges, and communities still need to be rebuilt. One of the largest infrastructure projects to be undertaken on the island is the rebuilding of Puerto Rico's energy grid, which needs more assistance.  Most importantly, in the absence of supplemental assistance, we estimate that 140,000 Puerto Ricans, U.S. citizens, are going to lose nutrition assistance at the end of March.  We are the United States of America--United States of America--and this is the U.S. Senate. We are supposed to take care of all our citizens when they have crises. We do not pick and choose based on with whom we are politically aligned.  I voted for disaster relief for States that were predominantly Republican and other States that were predominantly Democratic, but I don't look at it like that. I look at the fact that they are part of the United States of America, and they had a disaster. They should be helped.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 268, a comprehensive disaster package that provided over $14 billion to help all States and territories impacted by recent disasters to help them recover and rebuild. I worked closely with the House on this bill. I believe it will address the needs of all disaster-impacted communities.  On Tuesday, Senators Perdue and Jones and others, working very hard, introduced a similar but not identical bill. I am taking these bills with me this weekend. I am going to review them carefully. I thank the bipartisan group of Senators--Senators Perdue and Jones and others--for bringing the issue back to the forefront of the Senate. I am certainly committed to working with my good friend Chairman Shelby. I also worked with Republicans and Democrats in the House Appropriations Committee. I want a package that can pass both Chambers in addressing the needs of all States and territories hit by recent disasters.  I certainly urge the majority leader, Senator McConnell, to commit to bringing this to the floor as soon as possible. With that, I see other Senators on the floor.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, in the context of the ongoing negotiations with North Korea, there has been a lot of discussion today in the media about Otto Warmbier.  Otto Warmbier was a young man from my hometown of Cincinnati, OH. This is an emotional issue for me because, through the process of trying to bring Otto home, I got to know his family very well.  He was a young man with a lot of promise, 22 years old, and a college student at the University of Virginia. He had gone as a tourist to North Korea. He was pulled out of the line at the airport.  Here he was, a kindhearted college kid, found himself a prisoner in North Korea. He was there for about 18 months. His detainment and his sentence were appalling; unacceptable by any standards. At some point soon after being sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, from what we know, Otto suffered a severe brain injury. What happened? We may never know the details, but we do know one thing, and that is he was severely mistreated.  Who did the North Korean Government tell about the fact that he had this brain damage? No one. Unbelievably, for the next 15 months of his life, they kept this a secret. They denied him access to the best medical care he deserved, which of course we would have provided.  I was in communication with the North Korean Government during this time through their offices at the United Nations in New York. They didn't even tell us about the terrible mistreatment he had suffered and the condition he was in. They refused repeated requests for consular access that normally would have been provided to someone who has been detained, regardless of their health situation. This included denying requests, of course, from me, from others in this body and other bodies of Congress but also from the Obama administration, the Trump administration, the Red Cross, also from the Government of Sweden, which typically acts for us in North Korea as a consular service. I say that because while I support engagement with North Korea--in fact, in my experience with Otto Warmbier, it makes me even more convinced we need to have communication because we had no good lines of communication.  I support the ongoing talks with North Korea, specifically about denuclearization. I want to make clear that we can never forget about Otto. His treatment at the hands of his captors was unforgivable, and it tells us a lot about the nature of the regime. We can't be naive about what they did to Otto, about the brutal nature of the regime that would do this to an American citizen.  Of course, it is not just about Otto or other visitors. It is about how the people of North Korea are treated, many of whom also have had their human rights violated. No one should have to go through what the Warmbier family has gone through. They have been incredibly strong, by the way, through this whole ordeal. I watched them channel their grief into something constructive, exposing some of the human rights abuses in North Korea, as an example. Throughout this ordeal, I have stood with Fred and Cindy and their entire family. I will continue to, but I also want to say today, as we discuss these broader issues with North Korea, let's keep Otto Warmbier at the front of our minds. Let's be sure he is high on our agenda and in our consciousness as we deal with North Korea and, again, understanding, because of our experience with Otto, the brutal nature of this regime."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I will now talk about the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations' hearing we had today.  I am here to talk about China and the impact it is having on the U.S. education system. I chair the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which is a subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. My colleague Tom Carper, on the other side of the aisle, is the ranking member. We worked together on bipartisan--I believe you would say nonpartisan investigations.  We had success working on the opioid crisis in coming up with legislation to stop fentanyl from coming through the mail, the deadliest of all the drugs. We also had success in pushing back against human trafficking, leading to actually shutting down the website that trafficked more women and children than any other one, backpage.com.  Today we looked at something that is also very important for our country; that is, understanding better how these Confucius Institutes work. We issued a bipartisan report today talking about how there is a lack of transparency in how American colleges and universities manage their Confucius Institutes. These are located at more than 100 colleges and universities around the country. These institutions in America have received more than $150 million in support from the Government of China for these Confucius Institutes since 2006.  Confucius Institutes are enterprises that engage in the teaching of Chinese culture and language, and they are at universities and colleges around the world. These Confucius Institutes are designed, funded, and primarily staffed by the Chinese Government. The Chinese Government bills them as an opportunity for cultural exchange, and the funding comes from them. It is an appealing prospect for many U.S. schools trying to meet their demand for language instruction, but we need to be careful.  There needs to be more transparency in how these institutes operate in the United States, and there needs to be more reciprocity so the United States can also provide its cultural institutions in China. That is not happening now because China has systematically shut down comparable U.S. State Department public diplomacy efforts on college campuses in China.  Let me be clear. I do support cultural exchange--we all should; it is a good thing--with China and with the international community more broadly, but there needs to be reciprocity, and there needs to be appropriate engagement without, in this case, the Chinese Government determining what is said and what is done on U.S. campuses.  The law must be followed. That is why transparency is so important.  This morning we held a hearing following an 8-month investigation into this issue. Based on our findings, let me focus on these two issues of transparency and reciprocity--transparency in how colleges and universities manage the institutes which are controlled, funded, and mostly staffed by the Chinese Government and the lack of reciprocity in how China does not permit U.S. State Department programming in China.  Our report details how China, known for its one-sided dealings in trade--not having a level playing field in trade--also does not have a level playing field with regard to these cultural changes.  Our report documents how U.S. officials had expressed concerns about China's influence through its Confucius Institutes. Recently, the FBI's Assistant Director for Counterintelligence testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the Confucius Institutes are ``not strictly a cultural institute'' and that ``they are ultimately beholden to the Chinese government.'' The State Department has labeled Confucius Institutes ``China's most prominent soft power platform.''  Higher education groups have also expressed concern. The American Council of Education, the National Association of Scholars, and the American Association of University Professors have all recommended that U.S. schools fundamentally change how they manage Confucius Institutes or consider shutting them down.  Other foreign governments have already acted. For example, the UK Conservative Party Commission on Human Rights called for the suspension of further agreements until it can complete a more comprehensive review of potential threats to academic freedom at the Confucius Institutes in the United Kingdom.  The Canadian Province of New Brunswick recently announced that it would cease its Confucius Institute operations, citing academic freedom concerns and that the program provides a ``one-dimensional'' view of China. Finally, an Australian State, New South Wales, is currently reviewing the Confucius Institute program, citing that it exposes children to propaganda.  These concerns are well-founded. Past statements by Chinese officials make clear the purpose of Confucius Institutes. For example, in 2011, a former member of the Chinese Government explained:       The Confucius Institute is an appealing brand for expanding      our culture abroad. It has made an important contribution      toward improving our soft power. The ``Confucius'' brand has      a natural attractiveness. Using the excuse of teaching      Chinese language, everything looks reasonable and logical.  The Director General of Confucius Institute Headquarters has also commented on how the program controls messaging about controversial topics. She said in 2014:       Every mainland China teacher we send . . . will say Taiwan      belongs to China. We should have one China. No hesitation.  So with regard to issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and Tiananmen Square, the Confucius Institutes stay away from those issues that are considered controversial.  We know that Confucius Institutes exist as one part of China's broader, long-term strategy, but China has invested heavily in them, giving about $150 million to U.S. schools just in the last decade. China's other long-term initiatives include its Made in China 2025 plan, which is a push to lead the world in certain advanced technology manufacturing. The Thousand Talents Program is another state-run initiative designed to recruit Chinese researchers in the United States to return to China for significant financial gain, bringing with them the research knowledge gained at U.S. universities and companies. We plan on continuing to examine the U.S. Government's responses to these issues as well.  Confucius Institutes, by the way, do not stop at colleges and universities alone. China has also opened more than 500 Confucius Classrooms programs at U.S. K-12 schools. In fact, the Confucius Classroom program is a priority for the Chinese Government. A document obtained by the subcommittee during our investigation details a plan to expand Confucius Classrooms by seeking ``top-down policy support from the state government, legislative and educational institutions, with particular emphasis on access to the support from school district superintendents and principals.''  Over the last 8 months, we interviewed U.S. school officials, teachers, and Confucius Institute instructors. We also reviewed tens of thousands of pages of contracts, emails, financial records, and other internal documents obtained from more than 100 U.S. schools that were either active or recently closed Confucius Institutes.  Since our investigation started, more than 10 U.S. schools announced they would be closing their Confucius Institutes. We found that Chinese funding for Confucius Institutes comes with strings attached--strings that can compromise academic freedom. The Chinese Government vets and approves all Chinese directors and teachers, events, research proposals, and speakers at U.S. Confucius Institutes. Chinese teachers sign contracts pledging with the Chinese Government that they will follow Chinese law and ``conscientiously safeguard China's national interests.''  Some schools actually contractually agreed that both Chinese and U.S. law will apply at Confucius Institutes in the United States on their school campuses. Think about that. American universities are agreeing to comply with Chinese law on their campuses. This application of Chinese law at these schools can result, of course, in exporting China's censorship of political debate and prevent discussion of politically sensitive topics.  As such, numerous U.S. school officials told the subcommittee that Confucius Institutes were not the place to discuss topics like the independence of Taiwan, Tibet, or the Tiananmen Square massacre. Put simply, as one U.S. school administrator told us: ``You know what you're getting when something is funded by the Chinese government.''  Investigators from the Government Accountability Office also spoke with U.S. officials, who acknowledge that hosting the Confucius Institute could limit events or activities critical of China, not just at the Confucius Institute but also elsewhere on campus.  In response to the growing popularity of Confucius Institutes, the United States initiated its own public diplomacy program in China through the State Department. The Chinese Government effectively shut it down. Since 2010, the State Department has provided $5.1 million in grant funding for 29 American Cultural Centers in China. Through this program, a U.S. school would partner with a Chinese school to set up a cultural center, which would enable Chinese students to better understand our country, our culture.  The Chinese Government stifled the program from the start. Seven of the 29 American Cultural Centers never even opened. Of those that did open, they needed permission from the Chinese partner schools, sometimes including local Chinese Communist Party officials, just to hold events. Eventually, because of the obstacles, the State Department stopped funding the program altogether. There are four programs remaining. They are all going to be phased out entirely by this summer.  We heard some very interesting testimony today from the State Department--testimony that details the academic environment in China that has made it impossible for us to have the kind of freedom they enjoy over here. The State Department testimony aligns with the findings of our investigation.  For example, while the State Department conducts various public diplomacy programs in China, the Chinese Government has increasingly impeded access to some segments of Chinese society, including Chinese schools and universities. All Chinese institutions, including universities, have a foreign affairs officer or a ``gatekeeper'' that is an internal governmental office that manages contact between the non-Chinese entities and the institution. Any Chinese institutions that wish to interact with foreign government officials must obtain approval first from this gatekeeper.  The State Department even told us that the Fulbright Program, a prestigious and longstanding student exchange program, is impeded as Chinese authorities have prevented Chinese alumni of the Fulbright Program from forming a Fulbright Association, a standard practice in other countries. We even heard directly from an American educator who was detained by the Chinese police and questioned extensively about her involvement with a State Department grant. While the Department of State said they conveyed to the Chinese Government that it expects reciprocal access for U.S. diplomats in our programs, it is not happening. Obviously, more needs to be done.  While the State Department is mostly known for its overseas diplomatic efforts, it also has oversight responsibilities right here in the United States with regard to these Confucius Institutes. The State Department conducts field site reviews to ensure that foreign nationals who come to the United States on these Exchange Visitor Programs have visas that are appropriate and that they are here for the stated reason.  There are roughly 100 Confucius Institutes at colleges and universities in America, yet the State Department has conducted field visits only to two of them. At those two, they found serious problems. At the Confucius Institute, the State Department revoked more than 30 visas for Chinese visitors who were supposed to be working at the university that sponsored their visa but were actually teaching in the K-12 environment. They also discovered evidence of ``fraudulent paperwork and coaching'' that was a ``deliberate attempt to deceive'' investigators, according to the State Department.  The Chinese director coached the Chinese teachers to tell the State Department they were working on research programs that they really weren't working on at the university's campus.  State also told us it does not collect the visa information specifically related to the Confucius Institute, so we don't know how many Confucius Institute teachers there are or where they are. Again, they visited only 2 schools out of 100, and in those they found serious problems with regard to the State Department's responsibilities on visas.  Our investigation also identified failures at the Department of Education that have contributed to a lack of transparency and oversight at schools that take money from foreign governments. If a U.S. school receives more than $250,000 from a single foreign source in 1 year, it is required by law to report that data to the Department of Education, which, in turn, publishes it on its website. The Department of Education, however, has not issued any guidance on foreign gift reporting for 14 years, the same year that China opened its first Confucius Institute, and our investigation was able to find that 70 percent of the colleges and universities that should have reported receiving funds for Confucius Institutes from China did not; 70 percent are out of compliance. When a school fails to report a foreign gift, the Department of Justice can force the school to comply, but only at the request of the Secretary of Education. The Department of Education has never referred this type of case to them--never.  We received two important commitments at the hearing this morning. One is the Department of Education has committed to issuing new guidance to the more than 3,000 schools it oversees. This guidance is important to ensure that schools know that they are obligated to report receiving these foreign government funding sources. They also agreed to step up their enforcement on the law on reporting foreign government funds from Confucius Institutes.  The State Department committed this morning to do more to ensure visas are being properly used at Confucius Institutes around the country. Again, they conducted only two site reviews. They have to do more, and they said they will. We are going to follow up on that.  As with all of our investigations, we are developing legislation aimed at addressing the problems identified here today. I want to call attention, as I conclude, to a news report that came out just a couple of days ago. The Chinese Communist Party's central committee and the Cabinet published a document stating that the Confucius Institutes will remain ``a key government policy.'' Specifically, the news report plans to ``optimize'' the spread of Confucius Institutes. While it is unclear what ``optimize'' means at this point, any legislation must try to anticipate the potential rebranding of Confucius Institutes or other efforts that may seek to avoid the transparency, disclosure, and reciprocity that is needed if these programs are to continue on our campuses.  Thank you.  I yield the floor."

In that short time, Bruce wasn't short of legislative achievement, from negotiating the balanced budget agreement of 1997 to blocking the privatization of Social Security in 2006, from shepherding health reform through the Senate to passing the financial rescue bill after the crisis in 2008.  One of our most distinguished Senators would be proud of that record. Their name would be in lights. Bruce did all of that and much more in his, as I said, quiet, steadfast, brilliant dignity.  I have never sat on the Budget or Appropriations Committees, so when I became leader, having his experience and wisdom was incredible. I have met no one who could take these complex issues and put them in terms that even someone like myself could understand, not being an expert on those things. He was able to understand the big picture and never get caught in the minutia, although he knew the minutia extremely well.  When you ask Bruce's opinion on a matter, he presents it so succinctly and persuasively that you know it is the right answer in a matter of minutes, until he decides to play devil's advocate against his first opinion and convinces you of the opposite because he is one of those staffers who has never had an ax to grind. He said: Let my Senators know both sides, and let them decide.  But we knew both sides so well and so lucidly because of Bruce's ability to take these issues and help us understand them.  He can juggle so many variables in his head at once. He can weigh the pros and cons. He has an instinctive knowledge of how to deal with the tradeoffs, and he can keep it all in a simple way.  He is a modest man. He has sat at the same desk in the Capitol for 14 years. Every day, he brings his lunch--peanut butter and jelly sandwiches--and he leaves the office at almost the same time every night to have dinner at home with Janis, his beloved wife.  Senators get the spotlight and the credit when our initiatives succeed, but so many initiatives would never have succeeded without Bruce King. Bruce, through the years, deserves an ocean of credit for his work. He would never claim a drop of it because he is a humble man.  For all his expertise, he is humble, kindhearted, and thoughtful. Everyone likes him. In all the years he has worked here, I never heard a single person say a single bad thing about him. That is a pretty good tribute in a place like the Senate.  Bruce's departure will be a loss to his friends and colleagues and to the Senate as a whole and, of course, to my office.  There is only one bad thing I can say about him. He switched his allegiance from the New York Mets to the Nationals. The good news is that he will be able to catch some more games with Janis, his son Aaron, and his daughter Liana.  Bruce, you are a blessing to our office, to the Senate, and to the country. We wish you the best.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, to the Democratic leader and Bruce, who is on the floor, congratulations on behalf of all the Republicans in the room.  Come down to Atlanta and watch the Braves play the Mets. We would be happy to have you anytime. Thank you for your time here. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Two things happen at this time of day every day in the Senate and only two. The first is that the last person having their say finally gets up and says it, which means that you all have to listen to me for a minute. When the last person speaks, they don't tell you anything new. They tell you what everybody else said in a different way. You get to hear a small speech about that.  The other thing that happens is that Sheldon Whitehouse comes to the floor and talks about global warming. That happens every day. Sheldon hasn't been down here. I don't know if he is sick. I don't know where he is. I am going to replace Sheldon for a minute.  Every day goes by, and we ought to talk about climate change and things like that. I am going to talk about disaster relief, which ties right into climate change. I am not a global warming guy, except to say I think it is going on. It has been going on since the planet was created. It will be going on long since we are gone. How tough it is depends on our dealing with it--how we sequester carbon, how we manage carbon, and how we have businesses and industries find new ways to fuel their industries and fuel their mechanisms, and things like that.  Tell Sheldon when you see him that I came down to talk about how we do need to address these things. It is all of our responsibility. We can address it in a positive way, just like we did in the Montreal Protocol, where 25 years ago we got rid of fluorocarbons that were drilling a hole in the atmosphere and causing us to have terrible cancer of the skin.  Tell Sheldon I have listened to him. I heard some of his great speeches. Mine is not nearly as close to how good his are. I wanted to make sure a day didn't go by without our saying what Sheldon says.  I want to talk about the disaster bill that Senator Leahy, only a few minutes ago on the floor, talked about, and I want to talk about the urgent job we need to do in the Senate.  We had terrible disasters in the South and Southeast 3 years ago. We had hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes. Billions of dollars were lost in South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, and other locations. We failed to meet the disaster demands that we have to help those farmers and ag producers and business and industries to get back on their feet.  We now have a dire crisis. We have an emergency in the Southeast. It is time we got the disaster bill that we have been trying to pass for a year passed. We had it as a rider twice. We had it as a rider on the bill that was going to end the shutdown. At the last minute, it got negotiated out of the picture, not because it was a bad bill but because nobody would leave it in there and it did free up some money.  We have until March 15 to get it done. If we don't, there are going to be farmers in most of the Southeast who are going out of business. Industries that this Nation depends on will be terrible. You will pay way too much for your food. I don't know about you, but if you don't have nutrition to go with the energy you need, you don't have anything.  I am here to plead with every Democrat and every Republican that when we get the bill to the floor--and it will be some time before March 15--to support the disaster relief bill for the Southeastern United States and for Puerto Rico. The Democrats wanted so badly to add Puerto Rico to it, and the President signed off on that part. So we don't have a problem with the executive branch. I ask you to support all of the other provisions in it to see that those who were so badly damaged get their relief.  Let me tell you what that relief is. I am not talking about a handout. As an example, I am talking about the pecan industry that is housed in my State of Georgia. It is a tremendous industry in Asia. It is a tremendous export in the United States, with a tremendous balance of payments which contribute to our country. Well, 70 percent was wiped out. It takes 15 to 20 years to replace a pecan orchard. They have to start growth from a seedling to be a full, maturing tree to produce the crops to get to the marketplace.  Some of our crops are annual crops. A lot of them are long-term longevity crops. It is very important that we get them back on their feet. We will reclaim our place in the marketplace, but if we don't, somebody will take it away from us. Maybe it is Egypt, maybe it is India, or maybe it is somebody else.  I am down here to say that climate does change and we can do something about it by addressing carbon. And the economy changes. We can do something about it by helping industries.  When disasters come, if they are not responded to quickly and resolutely, they end up causing big losses to everybody in business, in productivity, and in our industries.  I want to ask everybody on the floor to please join me--hopefully, before the 15th or at least by the 14th of March-- to support the disaster bill that passed. Senator Shelby, Senator Leahy, myself, Senator Perdue, and Senator Rubio, and many others worked very hard on this to bring it together to get the pieces that were missing in place.  I want to thank, particularly, Senator Shelby and Senator Leahy for the time they and their staff have given us in the last couple of weeks to try to recover from the vote 2 weeks ago, when we lost what we thought was a solution to this problem.  Mr. President, I appreciate the time on the floor.  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Delaware."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I want to recognize the wisdom and insight from my friend and colleague from the great State of Georgia. We have unmet disaster needs in this country. I look forward to working with him to achieve the relief of the disaster impacts on the Southeastern United States and other States. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about climate change--to talk about something that is a pressing and real problem that affects everyone in this country, and, in fact, in our world. It is a challenge that we can't afford to ignore any longer because the health of our families, our economy, our environment, and even our national security, quite literally, depend on our ability to address it and address it promptly.  After a year of recordbreaking extreme weather in 2018--when we saw rising average temperatures fuel California's deadliest wildfire season on record, when Florida was faced with the strongest hurricane ever to reach that State's panhandle, and when farmers in Delaware and across the country faced challenges due to severe flooding and drought--it is clear that we can't afford to sit back and do nothing about climate change while the American people pay the price.  The costs of our inaction are real--real in human suffering, real in disaster recovery spending, real in lost economic opportunity, and real in the burden borne by our Armed Forces around the world.  Yes, there is a clear link between climate change and national security. The Pentagon has consistently pointed to climate change as a real national security threat that will make the military's job around the world harder. National security leaders from across administrations, both Republican and Democratic, have warned that climate change acts as a ``threat multiplier,'' increasing global instability and weakening fragile States as climate change leads to more extreme weather events and scarcer food and water resources.  In many ways, these findings echo themes about climate change that we already know--that it is already happening, that it continues to get worse, that it is going to cost us dearly, and that we can do something about it. It is that last point that I want to focus on. We can do something to stop the disastrous impacts of climate change, so long as we recognize it and work together in a bipartisan way to develop, take up, debate, and pass meaningful legislation that can make a difference.  Democrats have a broad range of bold and new policy proposals and of tested and fully developed policy proposals to address climate change. Many of them are bipartisan.  I wanted to come to the floor today to talk through 4 different bills that I have cosponsored--some that are relatively new and some considered across several Congresses--that are positive, constructive steps forward we can take to address climate change.  The first, and probably my oldest bill in this field, is called the MLP Parity Act--a catchy name, I know. It has five Republican colleagues who have cosponsored it now over three Congresses. This bill expands to renewable forms of energy, to carbon capture and sequestration, and to renewable and so-called clean energy a popular and long-established tax tool for financing energy projects that the oil and gas and pipeline sectors have enjoyed for decades. It would level the playing field. It would stop picking winners and losers in terms of energy tax policy. It would be, literally, an ``all of the above'' energy financing strategy. If enacted, it would be the first permanent change for the financing of clean energy projects in the U.S. Tax Code--potentially, worth billions of new private investment in renewable forms of energy.  It is also cosponsored by the Republican chair of the Energy Committee, Senator Murkowski, the Republican chair of the Banking Committee, Senator Crapo, and three other colleagues from across the country. We have five Democrats and five Republicans. It has had a hearing in front of the Energy Committee and a hearing in front of the Finance Committee in previous Congresses. This is the sort of solid, scored bipartisan bill that would be a meaningful step forward in addressing climate change.  Senator Lindsey Graham and I have introduced the IMPACT for Energy Act to create a private foundation to support cutting-edge energy research and technology commercialization. Why would we do this? What am I talking about?  Well, a guy named Bill Gates, one of the greatest inventors and innovators in American history, wants to deploy private investments and foundation investments alongside the Department of Energy, in partnership with a lot of other individuals, to significantly accelerate the cutting-edge research being done at our National Laboratories through the Department of Energy.  This is a tool that several other Federal Agencies already have. It is a so-called private foundation that allows them to marry up private sector dollars--foundation dollars--with Federal dollars to leverage greater impact. This private foundation can go out and raise that additional money and add it to the energy R&D already being funded by the Federal Government.  I also want to applaud the hard and bipartisan work of my colleagues, led by Senators Murkowski and Cantwell on the Energy Committee, on a comprehensive energy bill with a wide range of policy ideas that can move us forward. It has several components that I contributed and that would help to address climate change. I very much hope that in this Congress we can finally take up this bipartisan bill and see it signed into law.  Last, but in some ways most importantly, I want to mention a bill I offered at the end of the last Congress with my friend and former colleague, the Senator from Arizona, Jeff Flake. Despite our very different ideological, cultural and contextual backgrounds--we are from different States, from different faiths, and from different perspectives on the role of government and society; he is a real conservative, and I am a progressive Democratic--we still managed to come together and introduce a bill that addresses the cost of ignoring climate change and the impact it will have on the people in our home States.  We offered the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. It is a commonsense bill to achieve significant and sustained emissions reductions and to help to mitigate the worse impacts of climate change. Our bill would accomplish this by using a free-market approach to pricing carbon pollution that would spur economic growth and put money back in the pockets of American taxpayers. Similar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by a bipartisan coalition. I look forward to reintroducing this bill in this Congress.  The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act should be the centerpiece of a robust, bipartisan climate agenda because it aggressively tackles emissions while optimizing economic growth and income for working families. We estimate that our bill would reduce emissions by 90 percent by 2050, while creating as many as 2 million net new jobs in the next decade.  I believe this is an efficient way to use market forces to address the very real problem of climate change while creating jobs and opportunities for American workers. Frankly, an outright ban on nonrenewable sources would be inefficient and disruptive to workers from all sectors, but, in particular, across the building trades and other vital sectors of employment. In contrast, sending a strong market signal in favor of lower carbon or carbon-neutral energy would spur investment and growth in these technologies by the private sector and lead us toward a lower carbon future through competition.  We don't need to choose between clean energy and economic growth or between combating climate change and creating jobs. These two goals are not permanently and mutually exclusive. They can go hand in hand if we craft the right policies. Still, we cannot move abruptly away from an economy that relies heavily on fossil fuels without having a real and coordinated plan for the very people--the millions of Americans--whose jobs will ultimately be impacted by that transition.  Fortunately, a gradual transition to a clean energy future can also be an effective job creator. In 2017, the renewable energy and energy efficiency sectors alone employed 2.8 million Americans. If we place a price on carbon and then let the market work, we will create jobs across a wide range of industries, occupations, and geographies.  As we work to deal with the effects of climate change by moving to a cleaner energy and infrastructure economy--an economy that is more resilient--we will need to rely on workers who are already in place in many of these industries. We will need building trades professionals to construct and maintain our new resilient and clean energy infrastructure. We will need manufacturing workers to build these more energy-efficient products. We will also need scientists and engineers to help research, develop, design, and deploy these new technologies. These workers bring real experience and skills to the table, and we must ensure that these skills translate into new, good jobs and that the workers in these new jobs are able to organize for fair competition, for fair compensation, and for fair work conditions.  We can't tackle climate change alone. The United States is the largest historic emitter of carbon dioxide, but our emissions have been declining in recent years. Meanwhile, China has whirred past us, and China and India and other countries are rapidly catching up in their carbon emissions. We need an approach that incentivizes these countries to reduce their emissions as well. The United States is a world leader in science and technology and innovation. We need to develop and advance new technologies--carbon-neutral technologies like small, modular nuclear reactors and carbon capture and sequestration--that we can export. Then we need to find ways to encourage countries like China and India to modernize and industrialize while also reducing their emissions.  There is good work taking place in this area, and there are good solutions we can act on together. We need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a serious, thorough, deliberate, and thoughtful way. We need to be prepared to adapt to the ongoing impacts of climate change. We need to make sure American workers and families aren't left behind or are burdened by Federal climate policy.  This administration, unfortunately, strikes me as taking us backward. We are voting on an EPA Administrator in this Chamber who is failing to take action on climate, even on action that is widely supported by industry. Our President just proposed a National Security Council initiative to counter the consensus around climate change and refute the idea that greenhouse gases are harmful to the environment. I shouldn't even need to say this, but that just isn't how science works.  That is why, here in the Senate, we need to take the opportunity to lead and to have voices from both parties in Congress and in this country who want to take bold steps to address the climate. The hard part is going to be squaring these big, bold ideas with political reality. That is hard, but there are ways we can do it. Instead of being silent, we should bring this conversation to the forefront. Instead of debating whether climate change is real, we should be passing bipartisan bills, like the ones I have mentioned today, that can meaningfully address climate change and improve our economy.  Climate change is a serious threat to our economy, to our security, and to our way of life. We need leadership from all parts of our society and government to tackle it, and we must do our part in the Senate. I look forward to having conversations across the aisle, to working together, to identifying real solutions to the challenges before us, and to creating new opportunities for America's workers.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I have often said healthcare is not political. It is personal, and there is no part of healthcare that is more personal than the decision if, when, and under what circumstances to have a child and who decides the medical course of action in a serious medical crisis.  These decisions need to be made by women, their families, and their doctors. They should not be made by politicians who are more focused on their own political advantage rather than medical tragedies facing pregnant women at the end of pregnancy who want desperately to have a child.  Our Republican friends know very well that nobody--and I mean nobody--in this Chamber supports infanticide. No one. In fact, in 2002, Congress voted unanimously--100 Members, including myself--to reaffirm that it is illegal, period. Suggesting otherwise is insulting and, frankly, disgusting, and it is beneath the dignity of the U.S. Senate.  How dare the majority pretend to care about the health of women and children. If the Republican majority cares about the health of moms and their babies, why are you continuing to try to take their healthcare away? The President and the Republican majority have tried again and again and again to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  Let me remind you that before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could, and most of the time did, refuse to cover maternity care as basic healthcare for women, leaving parents with bills of tens of thousands of dollars for an uncomplicated birth.  As a member of the Senate Finance Committee, I was proud to author the provision requiring maternity care in the Affordable Care Act. I remember the debate. I remember a very specific debate with a former colleague from Arizona, and I remember Republican efforts to strip that provision to cover maternity care from the Affordable Care Act. Fortunately, they were not successful. Now the administration is legalizing and offering junk insurance plans that treat being a woman as a preexisting condition again.  One study found that none--none--of the newly approved plans cover maternity care. Maternity care is not a frill. It is basic healthcare for women, and if we are seeing more and more of these healthcare plans being put on the market, where women assume they are going to be covered and once again will not be, that is outrageous.  Why aren't we passing a bill to guarantee that prenatal care and maternity care are covered for moms and babies as essential healthcare in every insurance plan? I assure you, this medical care is essential, and until parts of the Affordable Care Act began to be unwound by the administration, it was viewed as essential care for every woman.  How dare you pretend to care about the health of women and children while voting to dramatically slash Medicaid and healthcare for low-income working families. When you gut Medicaid, you are keeping moms and babies from getting the healthcare they need. In fact, Medicaid provided prenatal care and maternity care for 43 percent of American moms and babies born in 2016--43 percent. Why aren't we voting to strengthen Medicaid? Why aren't we voting to strengthen Medicaid healthcare for moms and babies? Why isn't that being brought to the floor?  A few years ago, the Senate Finance Committee reported out a bill that I led with Senator Grassley called the Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act. This bill would create a set of maternal and infant quality care standards in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. The goal is simple: improving maternal and infant health outcomes. Shouldn't we all want to do that?  Let me be clear. We have no uniform quality standards right now across the country for almost half of the births that occur every year. The Quality Care for Moms and Babies Act will help make sure every mom--every mom--gets the best pregnancy care possible and every baby gets a healthy start. Why isn't that a top priority for action in the U.S. Senate, to protect the health of moms and babies?  Let's also be clear. We have a real healthcare crisis that we need to address in this country. In most of the world, fewer and fewer women are dying from child birth but not in the United States. In fact, our maternal mortality rate is climbing. More women are dying, and our infant mortality rate ranks a shameful 32 out of 35 of the world's wealthiest nations. The United States of America is 32 out of 35 countries--wealthiest countries in the world--in the number of infants that are dying in birth. That is something we need to have a sense of urgency to act on.  There are a lot of things on healthcare. There are a lot of things to improve outcomes for children and moms and give them a healthy start and a healthy life that we should be doing right now, as well as stopping the administration from undermining basic healthcare for women and children. It is time to stop the cynical political stunts and start protecting--really protecting--the health of moms and babies.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I am glad to join Senator Stabenow, who was on the floor just now, to respond to the shameful lies and gross exaggerations that have been claimed by some on the other side of the aisle.  Earlier this week, we voted on legislation that some of my colleagues claimed was needed to outlaw infanticide--the killing of babies. How absurd. It is, and has always been, illegal to kill any human, including infants.  So what was in that legislation we voted on earlier this week? To honestly discuss the bill, we need to have a factually and medically accurate conversation about abortion.  A healthy fetus becomes potentially able to live outside the womb at about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Very few abortions occur after that--less than 1 percent--and generally are performed either because the fetus has a fatal condition or the pregnant woman's life or health is at severe risk. These are heartbreaking situations involving very wanted pregnancies--hardly the time for the heavy hand of government to reach into our wombs.  Under this bill, doctors will be required to resuscitate infants born with fatal conditions, even if the parents did not want these measures that could prolong their infant's suffering and instead wanted to spend the limited time they had with their baby comforting their child and holding them close.  How dare anyone pretend to know what care is best for these families instead of trusting them and their doctors to decide. How dare Congress interject itself into a decision we have no business deciding for others. Yet this is exactly what this bill would have done.  I encourage my colleagues to read stories from women who have been speaking up about their experiences with abortion later in pregnancy. These stories are usually found on the internet as well as in the national press, as more women feel under attack and are coming forward to tell their stories. Perhaps, in hearing from these women, my colleagues will realize what these women need is compassion, not condemnation.  Stories like that of Dana Weinstein, who bravely told her story to CNN. Years ago, Dana and her husband learned at 31 weeks that their daughter's brain had a severe defect. Doctors told the couple their daughter would not be able to suck or swallow and would most likely suffer from uncontrollable seizures upon birth. They heard what a resuscitation order would entail. They listened to what an existence, short-lived or otherwise, would look like. They were briefed on hospice care.  After the diagnosis, the kicks in Dana's belly, which had given her so much joy, became unbearable. She feared her daughter was seizing and may be suffering. Ultimately, Dana and her husband decided to get an abortion. For this baby they loved, it felt like--in their words--``a more peaceful path for her passing.''  These are the stories. Compassion and understanding are what is needed in these instances, but instead of compassion, what my colleagues have offered this week is inflammatory political rhetoric and shaming and intimidating women and their providers who care for them in an attempt to score partisan points.  President Trump--never missing an opportunity to score partisan points--weighed in on Twitter claiming that Senate Democrats ``don't mind executing babies after birth.''  Today former Governor Scott Walker said to a crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference that ``people are taking already-born babies from the hospital and aborting them there''--a comment that doesn't even make sense.  Republican National Committee chair, Ronna McDaniel, chimed in at the same conference, calling the choice that women like Dana make murder. These charges are false, incendiary, and this sort of language is intended to incite the Republican Party's base. It emboldens violence against abortion providers--violence which nearly doubled from 33 reported death threats or threats of harm in 2016 to 62 in 2017, according to the National Abortion Federation.  The hard truth is, the Republican Party hurts women. One of the ways they are doing this is by working as hard as they can to set up barriers or to eliminate entirely safe and legal abortions wherever they can.  They demonize women who face the heartbreaking situation of needing an abortion later in pregnancy, oftentimes for medical reasons.  They want to cut off crucial healthcare dollars to providers who even discuss abortion with patients. This is a gag rule that this administration is seeking to impose.  They create loopholes to allow businesses to exclude coverage for contraception for workers, and to make sure that these and all of their other efforts stick, they pack the Federal courts with a line of aggressively anti-choice judges to uphold Federal Agency actions and State laws restricting abortion access.  Doing the bidding of these rightwing ideologue supporters like the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, Donald Trump has sent us judicial nominee after nominee with records of attacking a woman's right to choose as laid out in the Supreme Court's opinion in Roe v. Wade and restated in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.  These nominees come before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which I serve, and parrot the line provided for them by the Trump administration. When asked if they will respect precedent and uphold Roe v. Wade, they say they will ``follow the law.'' Then, when they get confirmed, they are in a position, with their lifetime appointments, to do exactly the opposite.  The prime and most dangerous example of this kind of bait and switch is Brett Kavanaugh--a notoriously rightwing political lawyer appointed by George W. Bush to the second highest court in the United States--the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit.  Kavanaugh was not even on Donald Trump's original so-called short list of possible Supreme Court nominees--not the list released before the 2016 election and not the first list released thereafter. No, Kavanaugh only found a place on that list after he wrote a harsh dissent in a case involving a young refugee's right to an abortion.  A minor, then 17 years old, was being kept in the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services because she had entered the United States without documentation. Where she was held in Texas, in order to access abortion services, a minor must have parental consent or receive permission from the judge. This is called a judicial bypass--to proceed without that parental consent.  In this case, called Garza v. Hargan, the young woman did go through the process of going to court and receiving a judicial bypass. She had people willing and able to transport her and to pay for the health services she needed, but the radical Trump appointee in charge, well known for his anti-abortion views, decided it would be in her best interest to find adult sponsors for her first, presumably to help her make a decision, but the Texas court had already decided she could make her own decision, and she did.  She challenged the Trump appointee and his Agency, and ultimately a majority of the DC Circuit agreed with her that she had the legal right to an abortion and the Federal Government could not delay any further.  Brett Kavanaugh, sitting on that circuit, disagreed and wrote a dissent, which must have captured the attention of those in charge of Donald Trump's Supreme Court short list because not long after his name appeared on that list.  What did he write to earn his place on the list and eventually a nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court? He wrote a dissenting opinion that falsely characterized the Garza case as one about parental consent, which we know was not so because a judicial bypass was already in place.  He wrote the dissent using the code words of the extreme anti-choice and anti-women wing of the Republican Party. He accused the majority on that court of creating ``a new right for unlawful immigrant minors in U.S. government detention to obtain immediate abortion on demand.'' He was wrong. There was no new right being created.  He falsely claimed that by permitting the abortion ``[t]he majority's decision represents a radical extension of the Supreme Court's abortion jurisprudence.'' He was wrong again. The majority decision was correct under Roe v. Wade.  He wrote it was not an undue burden for this young woman to be prevented from getting an abortion until a sponsor family could be found for her. This was not even a legal argument, but he based his dissent on it. That is the dissent that moved Brett Kavanaugh to the head of the line on the short list for a nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he sits.  So when he came to the Judiciary Committee for a hearing, some Senators--myself included--were rightly skeptical that he would respect precedent if confirmed. At his hearing, Ranking Member Dianne Feinstein asked Judge Kavanaugh about Roe v. Wade and its status as settled precedent. He testified that Roe was ``settled as a precedent of the Supreme Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.''  He further went on: ``Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirms Roe and did so by considering the stare decisis factors. So Casey now becomes a precedent on precedent.''  It sure sounds like someone who will apply the precedents of Roe and Casey and others who rely on them, doesn't it? That is not so.  The very first opportunity he got, Brett Kavanaugh, as Supreme Court Justice, voted against following precedent. Not 4 months after his confirmation, Justice Kavanaugh voted in the minority in a Supreme Court case called June Medical Services v. Gee to allow a restrictive, anti-abortion law in Louisiana to take effect.  This law would have so restricted access to abortion that only one provider would have been left in the entire State of Louisiana of 4.7 million people. Even Chief Justice Roberts voted with the majority to block the law. That is because it was clear from recent precedent in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt that such restrictions don't meet constitutional standards.  Justice Kavanaugh's cavalier attitude to the burden that he would put on a woman's ability to exercise their constitutional right is no surprise. His callous disregard for the way unwanted pregnancies can change the lives of women and children is not unexpected, and his willingness to hew to the party line of his supporters and ignore the assurances he gave the Senate is simply par for the course with Trump judicial nominees. This is what they do. It is an abuse of power, and women across the country are paying for it.  Why do my colleagues across the aisle use this Chamber, time and again, to bring forward political shams that shame and retraumatize women who face profoundly heartbreaking situations? The will of over half of this country is 67 percent of Americans support Roe v. Wade and access to safe and legal abortion. Sixty-seven percent of Americans support a woman's right to choose.  How is it that Republicans continue to bring forward bill after bill and amendment after amendment that goes against a constitutionally protected right of women--of women? This is why I say Republicans hurt women.  I am proud of the vote I cast in opposition to the sham bill we voted on this week. My vote was rooted in fact and understanding about what an abortion in later pregnancy actually means. It was rooted in the understanding that when faced with these difficult situations, these decisions are best left to a woman and her doctor. These decisions should not rest with the U.S. Senate.  My vote was cast with a clear understanding that if unchecked or unchallenged, this administration and this Senate will continue to assault a woman's right to choose and chip away at it bit by bit, where it will end up being a nullity, and that is what they want.  I will continue to stand in opposition to attacks that seek to limit the personal freedom of women across the country and what would be more of a personal freedom for a woman than to exercise control over her own body?  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to discuss why I voted in opposition to the confirmation of Andrew Wheeler for the position of Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.  Clean air and clean water are not only vital to our public health; they are at the very heart of our economy. Nowhere is that more apparent than in my home State of Michigan, where we are blessed to be surrounded by the Great Lakes, a source of drinking water for more than 40 million people and the lifeblood of our State's multibillion-dollar fishing, shipping, and tourism industries. That is why I spent my entire career in public service fighting to protect our environment.  In the Michigan State Senate, I worked to ban oil drilling under the Great Lakes to preserve our most precious source of drinking water. When I represented the city of Detroit in the House of Representatives, I fought to end harmful air pollution coming from piles of petcoke that left homes coated in dust while being breathed into the lungs of residents.  In my first term in Congress, I supported landmark climate change legislation that sought to drastically reduce deadly greenhouse gas emissions that are continuing to warm our planet at an unsustainable rate. In the U.S. Senate, I led the charge to protect the Great Lakes from pipeline spills and pressured industry to cut down their deadly sulfur-dioxide emissions that give Michigan communities some of the highest rates of asthma anywhere in the country.  I have championed these vital efforts because protecting our environment in Michigan is in the best interest of everyone, and I will never let up on that fight. There is so much more work to do and even more pressing challenges ahead of us. We cannot afford to turn back the clock on clean energy innovation or refuse to address climate change, and that is, unfortunately, what we can expect from the EPA now that Andrew Wheeler has been confirmed. His entire career has been devoted to undermining public health and environmental protections.  As Acting EPA Administrator, he is personally responsible for the most significant efforts to roll back our Nation's bedrock environmental laws in the Agency's history. He oversaw the proposed rollback of Clean Water Act protections that safeguard drinking water for tens of millions of people. He is leading efforts to weaken standards on the largest sources of greenhouse gases and to reduce protections against climate change. When he was a Senate staffer, he drafted the so-called ``Clear Skies Act,'' which was directly intended to undermine the Clean Air Act.  As a lobbyist for Murray Energy, Wheeler represented a company that didn't just knowingly violate environmental laws but consistently put its own employees' safety at risk by undermining basic protections for coal miners. He has even undermined the widely supported mercury and air toxics standards. These commonsense standards would have protected people, particularly children, from a well-known neurotoxin that impairs fetal brain development and reduces children's ability to learn.  Every single one of these actions has a direct bearing on human lives and has put people at risk. In Michigan we have witnessed firsthand the visceral and painful human costs when public leaders fail to keep our drinking water and our air quality safe. Just ask the people of Flint whom they would want to have in charge of protecting their drinking water. I can tell you it certainly is not Andrew Wheeler. The city, the State, and the EPA all contributed to the crisis that poisoned thousands of children through lead exposure, and now those children will suffer lasting consequences for the rest of their lives.  While I am proud that the Senate was able to come together to provide initial Federal funding to help Flint replace its lead pipes, the community needs continued support going forward. I am committed to doing everything in my power to ensure that the people of Flint are made whole, and that included my opposing this nomination. We cannot allow the failures of leadership that led to Flint's devastating crisis ever be repeated again.  The people of Michigan and of every State deserve to know that their air is safe to breathe and their water is safe to drink. Yet communities across my State and around the country are facing another emerging drinking water crisis. This time it is from toxic fluorinated chemicals, known as PFAS, that are currently unregulated by the EPA. Rigorous testing has found that 1 out of every 10 water systems in my State has unacceptable high rates of PFAS chemicals. Families across the State have been exposed to these dangerous chemicals that have been linked to cancer, thyroid and heart problems, and even autoimmune issues. But under Wheeler's leadership, the EPA has failed to take aggressive action to list PFAS chemicals as hazardous waste and to establish strong and forcible limits to protect drinking water and to limit exposure to these toxic substances.  While I work to bring Senate action to this issue through legislation and hearings, the Wheeler-led EPA thinks action can wait. Michigan families certainly deserve better. My constituents are understandably concerned about their drinking water, and they are rightfully skeptical about who will be at the helm of the Agency charged with keeping water safe.  Since Wheeler has failed to exercise the leadership needed to address the environmental concerns we face on a national level, it is clear that he is completely unprepared to lead the Agency charged with tackling the global crisis of climate change. We must confront climate change. I have been advocating for action since before I ran for Congress. It is an issue impacting our economy, our health, our safety, and our national security. I am committed to continuing to work with my colleagues to find innovative and achievable solutions to address climate change, but we also need a leader at the EPA who can find commonsense ways to address this very serious threat, to protect our environment, and to ensure that our country can remain economically competitive. We need a leader who will fight to protect the people and the interests of my State. Given his abysmal record, it is clear that Andrew Wheeler isn't the right person for the job, and that is why I voted against his confirmation.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as you know, I try to come down to the floor every week to talk about someone in my State who is making a big difference in Alaska, a big difference in their country, and a big difference in what I believe is the best State in this country. That is just my opinion. I am sure the Presiding Officer thinks his State is the best in the country, but that is why we are all here in the Senate.  Of course, Alaska is beautiful, particularly now as the snow is on the ground and the Sun is out. It is back out and high in the sky. It is also nearly time for the Iditarod--the last great race--something, I am sure, Senator Murkowski and I will be talking about on the floor in the coming weeks. It kicks off this weekend.  We know it is a beautiful and amazing State, but what really makes Alaska such a great place are the people--the people who work tirelessly for causes they believe in.  Many people don't know this, but Alaska is also incredibly diverse. In fact, Anchorage--my hometown and the State's largest city--is home to the country's three most diverse census tracks, racially and in terms of nationalities. By the way, the fourth is Queens, NY.  I will just give you an example. Last week, we had this great event called Bridge Builders. It was in Anchorage. There were all of these different ethnic communities in Anchorage coming together. I spent a lot of time there on Saturday.  We are very proud of our diversity. We are proud that more than 100 languages are spoken in our schools. Think about that if you want to talk about diversity. We are proud of the foods and the cultural events. We are proud of the unique tapestry that makes up Alaska.  We are very proud of our history, and we are also blessed to have people who work diligently for all of us to keep history alive. I can think of no better way to cap off Black History Month than to recognize someone who, for years, has been fiercely determined to unearth a very important part of Alaska's history--actually, a very important part of America's history--one that transpired in my State but that greatly influenced our Nation during a very critical time.  I want to introduce you to Ms. Jean Pollard. She is our Alaskan of the Week. Jean has brought back the story of the African-American Army Engineers of the 93rd, 95th, and 97th regiments who were in the U.S. Army during World War II and stationed in Alaska during World War II.  More than 3,000 of these brave soldiers were integral in Alaska in building what we call the Alcan Highway--the Alaska-Canada Highway--one of the 20th century's greatest engineering feats.  Let me tell you about Ms. Pollard. Now a retired schoolteacher, she grew up in Georgia. When she was a teenager, her father, who was in the Army, got transferred to Alaska. Like all Alaskan students--like our good students, our pages in the Senate--she took a class on her State's history--Alaska history--in high school.  During the class, she learned about how the Army built the Alcan Highway in 1942 to help defend Alaska and America from invasion by Japan. A lot of people don't know this. Yes, Alaska was invaded and occupied by the Japanese military during World War II in the Aleutian Islands. I am going to talk about that a little bit more.  She learned about this in high school. It was a good story, but the most important element she was taught in high school was actually left out. The highway was only able to be finished because of the more than 3,000 African-American soldiers who built it.  So after getting a master's degree in education and a minor in history and after being a teacher for decades, Ms. Pollard only learned the entire story herself when she was sitting home one Friday night watching a PBS documentary about the building of this incredible highway.  What did she learn? Again, let's go back in time. It is March 1942, 3 months after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. As the war effort was heating up, construction began on a 1,700-mile-long vital link connecting the great State of Alaska--it wasn't a State then; it was a territory--to the lower 48 for the war effort.  Soon a massive mobilization followed--about 10,000 Army troops. Huge trucks, civil engineers, food, tents, you name it, were deployed to start building this road.  Then, in June 1942, the Japanese invaded Attu and Kiska Islands in the Aleutian Islands chain of Alaska, adding a new sense of urgency to the completion of the road.  These soldiers worked day and night--200 bridges, 800 culverts, through some of the most rugged terrain on planet Earth, mountains, rivers, no rest, hard, backbreaking work--and they were able to complete this 1,700-mile road that still exists today--some of you may have driven it--in less than a year.  When the road was being built, the military was still segregated, and African Americans in the Army--much like in the rest of the country--were treated as second-class citizens. They were assigned to the toughest jobs on this project, using the worst equipment. In the summer, it was full of mosquitoes, black flies, mud, and swamps.  Winter comes early in Alaska. According to the historian, Lael Morgan, the winter of 1942 was considered one of the worst winters on record since 1906 in terms of how cold it was--and, trust me, it gets cold in Alaska--and how much snow there was.  The Black troops were required to build winter barracks for the White soldiers, while the African-American troops lived in tents. When the snow fell, they couldn't get supplies, and some nearly starved to death, Lael wrote. It is reported that some even succumbed to injuries due to the cold--fatalities due to the cold.  They did so much of the hard work. However, the contribution of these great African-American soldiers and heroes were completely almost scrubbed from all of the history books. Nobody that Ms. Pollard spoke to--social studies teachers or history professors--knew anything about this history.  In Ms. Pollard's words: ``They stole that history.'' The history books wouldn't write it. It was wrong, and she knew she had to make it right so she went to work.  As a teacher herself and a lifelong learner, she knew that bringing the story to the school system was key to keeping our history alive--accurate history. Eventually, she called the historian I spoke about, Lael Morgan--a former Alaskan who was then living in Maine and happened to be featured in that documentary that Ms. Pollard watched on that Friday evening.  Lael decided to help in a big way. Incredibly, a year later, she sold her house in Maine and headed up the Alcan Highway to Alaska. Together, and with the help of a team of others Ms. Pollard recruited, they amassed enough material to give to the school system to set the history right.  Now schools across Alaska are putting this story--this real story--into their curriculum, and now she is trying to get it required as part of a course that the university students in Alaska who are studying education have to take.  She and her team put calls out across the internet for anyone who was involved in or had a relative involved in building the highway. She was able to track down three members of the African-American Army Engineers who were still alive. She flew to interview one of the soldiers who was 100 years old. Another one, who lives in Louisiana, traveled to Alaska in 2017 for the 75th anniversary of the highway's completion.  Recently, Ms. Pollard mentioned the names of the soldiers she spoke to back then. There was a soldier from Virginia, SGT Reginald Beverly, who, unfortunately, has now passed away. The soldier in Louisiana who came to Alaska in 2017 is Private Leonard Larkins. He has 10 children. The Alaska Highway Project will be bringing him and his three sons back to Alaska on August 3 to help him celebrate his 99th birthday.  I am in the process of drafting a Senate resolution to recognize all of the members of the African-American Army Engineers who helped build the Alcan Highway, which was so critical to protecting our Nation and Alaska.  Ms. Pollard describes herself as feisty. Others might describe her as fiercely determined. When the Alaska State Legislature, at her urging, passed a resolution commemorating these African-American soldiers who built one of the greatest engineering highways in the world, she was sitting behind some of the State legislators.  She heard one whisper to another: Have you met this Jean Pollard?  The other said: Yes, she calls me several times a day about this bill.  Julie and I were just with Ms. Pollard this past weekend, as I mentioned, at the Bridge Builder event in Anchorage--my wife Julie and I. She is very passionate, very persuasive, and we are very proud of her.  Ms. Pollard and the team that created the Alaska Highway Memorial Project are on another mission to erect a memorial in a park in Anchorage. They have the design, and they certainly have the will with her driving it, and I have no doubt they will get it done to memorialize this great engineering feat by American heroes who were not treated well by their country.  Like the story of how Ms. Pollard brought important history back to our State, the story of building the Alcan and of the civil rights in the military also has an uplifting message.  On October 25, 1942, less than 8 months after they started, two soldiers, one African American and one White, shook hands after completing this highway. Six years later, President Harry S. Truman ordered the Army desegregated, 16 years before the passage of the Civil Rights Act. Many historians now cite the work and the experience on this Alcan Highway project, and the African-American soldiers and White soldiers working together on a really difficult challenge, as also helping make that possible--civil rights, 16 years later.  The Federal Highway Administration calls the Alcan Highway the road to civil rights. Isn't that a great depiction?  So, Ms. Pollard, thank you and your team for bringing that history back to us. I am proud to have talked a little bit about that important history for Alaska and America on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Congratulations for being our Alaskan of the Week.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, the White House recently unveiled the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, W-GDP, an interagency plan to increase women's global labor force participation and advancement in the workplace, improve access of women entrepreneurs to market opportunities, and remove barriers to economic growth for women.  I support the initiative, although not based on the erroneous claim of some in the White House that it is the first women's initiative ever launched by the United States. On the contrary, I and many other Members of Congress and previous administrations have supported such efforts for many years. However, there is still a lot of work to be done, and I hope W-GDP builds on those efforts.  Too many of this administration's actions have fallen far short of the President's rhetoric or have been the antithesis of what he promised, so while I am ready to do what is necessary to support W-GDP, I worry that this initiative may be part of the same story. From human trafficking at the southern border, to processing asylum applicants, to combating HIV/AIDS, this administration purports to be serious about addressing global problems while implementing policies or proposing budgets that bear no resemblance to effective solutions and in many cases would make the situation worse.  For example, while the objectives of W-GDP are laudable, it is being implemented by the same White House that sought to cut the budget for the Department of State and foreign assistance programs by roughly 30 percent in fiscal years 2018 and 2019, cuts that would have decimated funding for programs that address the needs of the world's poorest people, for water and sanitation, maternal and child health, education and employment opportunities, to stave off poverty and disease that disproportionately afflict women and girls. In fact, the President's budget did not include a single dollar for W-GDP.  This administration has also waged war on reproductive health, reportedly directing the omission of reporting on reproductive rights in the State Department's annual Country Reports on Human Rights, and one of President Trump's first acts after his inauguration was to reinstate the Global Gag Rule. In fact, egged on by extremists in his administration, he expanded it to condition funding for every nongovernmental organization, NGO, implementing any health programs for the United States overseas, even if their programs have nothing to do with reproductive health. In other words, if an NGO spends millions of dollars in India to combat HIV/AIDS, but spends $1 of its own private funds--not U.S. taxpayer funds--to provide counseling on abortion, it is ineligible for any U.S. Government funding for either purpose. Such a policy would be unlawful in our own country.  So while I support W-GDP, I caution all those who defend women's rights and support economic opportunities for women to not be distracted by one initiative this administration launched on the backs of the Congress's rejection of President Trump's budget and to call on the White House to adopt a more consistent, comprehensive approach to supporting women around the world.  With that in mind, I hope the White House will speak out forcefully and consistently about the institutionalized and systemic persecution and discrimination of women in Saudi Arabia and other countries whose autocratic and corrupt governments this White House has embraced. If the White House expects to be taken seriously about women's empowerment, it cannot remain silent about governments whose laws and policies treat women as property and that imprison women's rights activists.  This is not the only area in which the administration is purporting to support vulnerable populations while its short-sighted policies are having the opposite effect.  In a November 30, 2018, op-ed in the Washington Post, Ivanka Trump announced that the administration had decided to limit the number of waivers for assistance for countries that are identified in the State Department's annual Trafficking in Persons Report as failing to meet minimum standards for combating human trafficking. She also noted the administration's pledge of $45 million to a fund to end modern slavery, funds that, as is true for W-GDP, the President did not include in his budget and from an account the White House proposed to cut.  I agree with the goal of holding governments accountable for failing to meet minimum standards for preventing trafficking in persons, but informed people know that cutting funding for health, education, environmental conservation, counterterrorism, and governance programs does nothing to prevent human trafficking, while it undercuts our ability to make progress on other issues of national interest.  Yet that is exactly what the administration has done. By belatedly approaching human trafficking as if nothing else matters and limiting use of the waiver authority Congress provided, administration officials have spent months tying themselves in knots over which programs to continue and which to suspend. The result is that implementing partners are running out of money, services are not being delivered, and important programs are shutting down.  The Trump administration needs to stop governing by sound bite. If the White House is serious about addressing human trafficking and other complex challenges, it should work with Congress to secure the necessary funding and apply the law in a common sense manner that is consistent with our national interests."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I want to briefly discuss the situation in Egypt, a country where unchecked repression has come to define the government of President el-Sisi.  The 2011 Egyptian revolution brought hope of a democratic future for the country, but it has failed to materialize, subverted by aspiring autocrats. After winning historic democratic elections in 2012, the Morsi government sought to consolidate its control, issuing a declaration to provide the President with sweeping authorities and eliminating checks on Executive power. The response was another popular uprising and a military coup led by then-Defense Minister Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.  Although cheered by some who favor President el-Sisi's crackdown on the leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood and anyone suspected of being affiliated with it, his Presidency has become a model for autocratic rule. His police have arrested human rights lawyers, journalists, civil society activists, and opposition politicians. Anyone who criticizes the regime or calls for a more democratic system is threatened, arrested, and accused of ``terrorism'' or some other vague crime against the state. Once detained, they have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse while they wait for months or more often years before being subjected to sham trials that make a mockery of due process.  Earlier this month, President el-Sisi's government took another step to consolidate his rule. Egypt's rubberstamp Parliament approved constitutional amendments that would enable el-Sisi to remain in power until 2034, 12 years beyond the end of his second and final term. Other amendments would enable el-Sisi to tighten his control of the judiciary, create a second Parliamentary chamber dominated by Presidential appointees, and expand the authority of the military to codify its role in civilian political life. Egypt today is a civilian government in name only. The military, led by el-Sisi, effectively wields total control.  In 2011, we all hoped the Egyptian people had a brighter, albeit challenging, political future ahead of them, but 7 years after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak, the el-Sisi government is erasing any remaining hope for democracy in the country. The calls of those who flooded the streets under Mubarak and Morsi for greater political freedom and civil liberties, less corruption, and more accountability are treated not as visions for Egypt's future, but as threats to el-Sisi himself.  Regrettably, it seems that the only constant in U.S.-Egyptian relations over the last several decades, besides Egyptian Government repression and billions of dollars in U.S. military aid, is the reticence with which successive U.S. administrations have confronted this issue. There always seems to be an excuse for why now is not the time to insist on meaningful progress to advance democracy and human rights by our ally Egypt. If not now, when? What line would the Egyptian government have to cross for the Congress and the administration to recognize the threat that a brutal military dictatorship poses to stability in Egypt, and to our long-term interests in the region?  Every U.S. administration has engaged, in varying degrees, in quiet diplomacy to address human rights abuses and corruption overseas and issued public statements or withheld foreign aid to encourage progress. Diplomacy, if backed up with consequences, can achieve results, but successive Egyptian Governments have gambled that, at the end of the day, we will look the other way in the mistaken belief that doing so serves U.S. security interests, and by and large, that has been the case.  It is interesting to compare the Trump administration's selective condemnation of government repression in other countries, where the number of political prisoners is a fraction of those in Egypt, to President Trump's pronouncement that President el-Sisi as a ``great guy.'' What a sad commentary on what this country purports to stand for.  We must acknowledge what history has repeatedly shown, that upholding our values is the best way to protect our interests. That does not mean cutting off all aid and walking away from Egypt. That kind of reactionary approach is equally short-sighted. What it does mean is that we need a more principled, measured, and consistent policy and make clear that our aid is not a blank check--that Egypt's leaders are not above the law; that freedom of expression is universal; that due process is a right; that torture, cruel and inhuman treatment are forbidden under international law; and that governments should be accountable to their people.  At a time when President el-Sisi is seeking to manipulate the legislative process to cement his hold on power for life, senior officials at the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon need to stand up for what is first and foremost in our national interest: the principles that define us as Americans.  I hope all Senators will join me in encouraging the Trump administration to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors and realign our policy toward Egypt with our values."

I was pleased Beth Tanzman, the executive director of Vermont's Blueprint for Health, agreed to be a witness at today's hearing to share the innovative approaches Vermont has taken to combat opioid use disorders. Ms. Tanzman has also served as Vermont's deputy commissioner for mental health and also directed adult mental health services for Vermont's Department of Mental Health.  While certainly not spared from the opioid epidemic, Vermont is ahead of much of the country in many ways: Our State openly identified the problem, and our former Governor, Peter Shumlin, dedicated his entire State of the State address in 2014 to constructively seek ways to not just help addicts get clean, but to halt this scourge in its tracks. Public health leaders, addiction specialists, doctors, and State leaders came together and implemented a system to integrate substance abuse treatment with primary healthcare.  Ms. Tanzman's testimony focused on the system developed through this collaboration, known as the Hub and Spoke Model. The plan helps support those in recovery with nine regional hubs, offering daily medication assisted treatment for those with complex addictions, and spokes, where patients receive follow-up care, counseling, and general wellness services. This framework has allowed Vermont to virtually eliminate wait times for treatment, which can be enormous barriers for individuals needing help.  Every State in the Nation has seen the impacts of opioid abuse. Ms. Tanzman's testimony was informative and offers an important perspective for other States struggling with treating addiction. I ask unanimous consent to that her testimony from the Appropriations Committee hearing this morning be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: "

                "speech":"Mr. President, February marks the anniversary of the massive, peaceful protests against Bahrain's repressive regime in 2011. Bahraini citizens, men and women of all ages and backgrounds, demanded more accountability from their leaders and more agency in their lives.  Instead of sitting down with the protestors as leaders in Oregon or Washington, DC, often do, Bahrain's rulers unleashed the country's security forces on them. I am afraid that it has now become a rather sad tradition of mine to remind the Senate of these events, and so before February gives way to March, I just wanted to offer a few words on why this issue continues to resonate.  Bahrain held elections in November 2018, but they were hardly on the level. ``The Economist'' termed them ``unfair.'' The head of Human Rights First called them ``fake elections.'' The Project on Middle East Democracy and Americans for Democracy & Human Rights in Bahrain said they were a ``sham.'' The list goes on.  This should come as no surprise to anybody paying attention to development in Bahrain because the regime banned opposition parties from participating altogether. That is not exactly a recipe for a free, fair, or legitimate outcome.  Indeed, the regime has spent the past couple years detaining, intimidating, and silencing the political opposition.  But don't take my word for it, that's how Amnesty International characterized the situation before the November elections.  The repression extends far beyond the ballot box. Human rights advocates say the regime has arbitrarily stripped hundreds of individuals of their citizenship in the past few years.  Human Right Watch indicates that the regime closed the last remaining independent newspaper in 2017. Freedom House says the regime continues to bully journalists and to persecute those who are critical of the regime.  Bahrain is a longtime U.S. ally in a tumultuous region. My intent with these annual statements is neither to insult the Kingdom nor to demand the administration cut ties.  No, the point of these statements is to make it clear that I believe the United States should always promote basic rights and values and further, that I believe the United States must--must--hold its friends and partners to a higher moral standard.  I was concerned that the previous administration did not do more to push Bahrain's rulers on this point, but I am deeply disappointed that the Trump administration seems hell-bent on setting a new low.  The President himself has made clear that he views the world through a transactional lens and is willing to overlook rights violations in the name of arms sales or greater defense cooperation.  So it is hardly surprising to read that Trump administration officials fail to raise human rights concerns with their Bahraini counterparts.  This must change. I hope it will change. And I hope that the influx of new members of Congress following the 2018 midterm elections will cause it to change.  Today I renew my call on Bahrain's monarchy to stop brutally repressing peaceful protest, to release political prisoners like Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and Nabeel Rajab, and to offer Bahrainis a greater voice in their country's future."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the service and achievements of Ms. Chris Correale, director of harbor development for the Maryland Port Administration, upon her retirement.  Chris Correale is the ultimate example of a public servant whose expertise and efforts while unknown to the majority of Maryland's residents, have been critical to Maryland's economy and environment.  An expert in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers processes, Chris has spent more than 25 years crafting and implementing innovative and collaborative Federal and State beneficial reuse projects that kept the Port of Baltimore's shipping channels open and improved the environment in the Chesapeake Bay. From dredging, construction, beach replenishment, habitat restoration, and permitting, Chris has been the visionary behind the development of projects that have significantly improved the infrastructure, environment, business climate, regional partnerships, and economic development opportunities throughout the State of Maryland.  At the Maryland Port Administration, Chris ensured the Port of Baltimore's channels are in top condition for maritime traffic serving the port. She oversaw the planning and policy of what to do with the dredged material, she secured State and Federal funding for the port, and she coordinated multi-agency management of the port's aids to navigation systems.  Prior to joining the Maryland Port Administration, Chris had a distinguished career as the chief of the operations division of the U.S. Army Corps' Baltimore District. By overseeing the Baltimore District's navigation program, Chris was instrumental in the operations, maintenance, protection, and restoration of Maryland's ports, military installations, levees, Federal channels, island habitats, and reservoirs.  Chris's retirement is a loss for the State of Maryland. Her vision, expertise, and extraordinary social skills have enabled her to successfully navigate the Federal, State, and local forces to bring so many critical projects to fruition. She has significantly improved the infrastructure, environment, and business climate throughout the State of Maryland, and she will be missed. Therefore, it is my honor to recognize the contributions of Ms. Chris Correale to the State of Maryland and thank her for her years of valuable service."

                "speech":"Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act along with two members of the Select Committee on Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator Warner, in addition to Senator Kennedy and Senator Jones, who also serve with me on the Senate Banking Committee. In response to data breaches of various companies that exposed the personal information of millions of customers, our legislation asks each publicly traded company to include--in Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, disclosures to investors--information on whether any member of the board of directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if not, why having this expertise on the board of directors is not necessary because of other cybersecurity steps taken by the publicly traded company. To be clear, the legislation does not require companies to take any actions other than to provide this disclosure to its investors.  In Deloitte's 11th Global Risk Management Survey of financial services institutions, published last month, ``sixty-seven percent of respondents named cybersecurity as one of the three risks that would increase the most in importance for their business over the next two years, far more than for any other risk. Yet, only about one-half of the respondents felt their institutions were extremely or very effective in managing this risk.'' According to the 2018-2019 National Association of Corporate Directors Public Company Governance Survey, only 52 percent of directors ``are confident that they sufficiently understand cyber risks to provide effective cyber-risk oversight,'' and 58 percent ``believe their boards collectively know enough about cyber risk to provide effective oversight.'' Indeed, Yahoo, in its 2016 annual report, disclosed, ``the Independent Committee found that failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security Incident. The Independent Committee also found that the Audit and Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately informed of the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 Security Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident here refers to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account information for approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoo's network in late 2014.''  This is particularly troubling given that data breaches expose more and more records containing personally identifiable information. Indeed, according to the Identity Theft Resource Center, the number of these types of records exposed by data breaches in the business industry grew from 181,630,520 in 2017 to 415,233,143 in 2018 and in the medical and healthcare industry from 5,302,846 in 2017 to 9,927,798 last year. Across all industries, the number of records containing personally identifiable information exposed by data breaches rose 126 percent, from 197,612,748 in 2017 to 446,515,334 in 2018.  Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether publicly traded companies are prioritizing cybersecurity and have the capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber related attacks. Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues through improved SEC disclosure.  In testimony given to the Senate Banking Committee last June, Harvard Law Professor John Coates, who also practiced securities law as a partner at Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, expressed support for our legislation by stating that ``[the Cybersecurity Disclosure Act] is well designed. It does not attempt to second-guess SEC guidance and rules regarding disclosures generally, or even as to cyber-risk overall. The bill simply asks publicly traded companies to disclose whether a cybersecurity expert is on the board of directors, and if not, why one is not necessary. To be clear, the bill does not require every publicly traded company to have a cybersecurity expert on its board. Publicly traded companies will still decide for themselves how to tailor their resources to their cybersecurity needs and disclose what they have decided. Some companies may choose to hire outside cyber consultants. Some may choose to boost cybersecurity expertise on staff. And some may decide to have a cybersecurity expert on the board of directors. The disclosure required would typically amount to a sentence or two.''  While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence. Through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence perspective, I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of our national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy becomes ever more dependent on technology and the internet.  Indeed, General Darren W. McDew, the former commander of U.S. Transportation Command, which is charged with moving our military assets to meet our national security objectives in partnership with the private sector, offered several sobering assessments during an April 10, 2018 hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He stated that ``cyber is the number one threat to U.S. Transportation Command, but I believe it is the number one threat to the nation . . . in our headquarters, cyber is the commander's business, but not everywhere across our country is cyber a CEO's business . . . in our cyber roundtables, which is one of the things we are doing to raise our level of awareness, some of the CEO's chief security officers cannot even get to the see the board, they cannot even . . . see the CEO. So that is a problem.''  In my view, this is a real problem because, if we are attacked, the first strike will likely not be a physical one against the military but a cyber strike against the infrastructure of movement, logistics, and other critical assets in the civilian space.  With growing cyber threats, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our Nation's cybersecurity before there are additional serious breaches. This legislation seeks to take one step towards that goal by encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to their investors and customers on whether and how their boards of directors and senior management are prioritizing cybersecurity.  I thank the bill's supporters, including the North American Securities Administrators Association, the Council of Institutional Investors, the National Association of State Treasurers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, the Bipartisan Policy Center, MIT Professor Simon Johnson, Columbia Law Professor Jack Coffee, Harvard Law Professor John Coates, K&L Gates LLP, and the Consumer Federation of America, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins, Senator Warner, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jones, and me in supporting this legislation.

                "speech":"Mr. President, before the Presidents Day recess, I announced that I would introduce legislation if the tax extenders weren't included in the legislation that we passed at that time that would keep government open.  Today I am following through on that promise with a bill that I am introducing with Finance Committee ranking member Senator Wyden of Oregon.  It is fitting that I am taking this step in the same month as Groundhog Day, as the subject of my remarks is something that Congress has had to deal with too many times already.  Next to me is a depiction from the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' which is about a man named Phil who must relive the same day over and over until he gets everything right. While we still need to break the cycle of repetitive short-term extensions, the right thing to do right now is to extend these already-expired provisions for 2018 and 2019.  As I have said before, the tax extenders are a collection of temporary tax incentives that have required extension on a very regular basis in order to keep them available to the taxpayers. Currently, there are 26 provisions. At one time there were as many as 50-some. We have done away with some of them and made some of those laws permanent, but these 26 provisions expired at the end of 2017. They need to be extended, as well as three others that expired at the end of last year.  Today we are in the middle of filing season for 2018 tax returns, and taxpayers affected by these expired provisions need a resolution so that they can file. I want to stress that I want to find a long-term resolution so that we don't have to have temporary tax policy, but it is critical we make it clear to the taxpayers that these provisions are available for the 2018 filing season and extending them for this year will give us room to take a needed long-term view of this temporary tax policy.  Many of the tax extenders are intended to be incentives, and to be successful, then, these incentives need to be in effect before decisions can be made. That is why we should provide extensions for at least 2 years, to maximize that incentive effect. But it is also important that we extend these provisions for 2018, even though the year has obviously already ended. We have developed a very bad policy and a very bad habit of extending these tax provisions year after year, and people and businesses have come to expect that the extension will happen.  As a result, decisions were made by various businesses in 2018 based upon the expectation of extension, and that is a reasonable expectation because we have done it over decades. In other words, people did what we wanted them to do in their business decisions when these provisions were created. We should not retroactively punish these businesspeople for Congress's inaction.  Today, a diverse group of organizations, including the National Biodiesel Board, the American Trucking Associations, and the National Corn Growers Association, among others, sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting that the expired provisions be extended through 2019 as quickly as possible. I want to quote a few sentences from that letter:       Providing taxpayers with a predictable planning outlook as      it pertains to tax rules is conducive to increased private      sector investment and economic activity. Accordingly, we      respectfully ask that you act to retroactively extend these      expired tax provisions through 2019 on the first appropriate      legislative vehicle.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete letter be printed in the Record.       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be      printed in the Record, as follows: Mr. President, another very important point I want to make has to do with the question about whether an extender package should be offset or not. Around here, the word ``offset'' means if you have tax provisions that might lose revenue, then do you have other revenue coming in to take its place? The House has decided that is what you should do--pay as you go, or PAYGO, as they might call it. It is a rule of the House.  I have a long record of promoting budget responsibility, and I am as concerned about the deficit and debt as anyone. However, we also have bipartisan precedent for treating the extension of temporary tax policy, like these extenders, just as we treat the extension of annual spending policy. In neither case do we need offset for such extensions. In other words, it is all right to spend more money or continue to spend the same amount of money after a program has expired, and you don't have to offset it when you have tax law that has been on the books for a couple of decades, and it is sunset. Why should you have to sunset that? There are a few people around here who think it is all right to spend money without offsets, but it is wrong to do tax policy unless you have offsets.  There are a few specific items in this legislation that I want to take time to mention. Significant work has already been done to provide long-term solutions on two extenders--the short line railroad tax credit and the biodiesel tax credit.  The bill I am introducing extends those credits at their current levels for 2018 and 2019. I want my colleagues to know that I still remain committed to enacting the compromises that several of our colleagues and I worked with the stakeholders to achieve.  The bill also includes an extension of a proposal adopted last Congress that would extend the 7.5-percent floor for itemized deductions of medical expenses. Without this provision, the floor on deductions will be 10 percent for 2019. This means that without this provision, individuals with chronic illnesses and high medical expenses would have to pay more for healthcare before that excess can be deducted in the expenses on their 2019 tax returns.  This proposal is a very important priority for one of our best colleagues, Senator Collins. She deserves a lot of credit for getting what has turned into a bipartisan proposal to help many Americans facing catastrophic medical expenses.  Finally, the legislation includes provisions to assist Americans who have been affected by natural disasters in 2018. This package includes proposals that we have adopted in prior years to help Americans recover from natural disasters across our country. For example, the package would allow increased access to retirement funds and relax restrictions around charitable giving. I am sure everyone here would like to help people affected by these natural disasters as soon as we are able to.  I don't want my comments today to imply that each tax extender should be permanently extended, but the right thing to do now is to provide extensions for at least 2018 and 2019. In the long term, Congress needs to decide if these provisions should be allowed to expire or if they should be phased out or if they should be made permanent as current tax policy or modified in some way beyond expiring, phasing out, or being made permanent.  Those decisions need to be made after we resolve the short-term crisis caused by the current lapse. These provisions have support of Members on both sides of the aisle. For people who think that things around here get done only with Republicans fighting Democrats or vice versa, these provisions have wide bipartisan support.  There is a solid foundation for a long-term package consisting of many of these provisions in one form or another. We need to get past today so that we can chart the course for a reliable future for the tax extenders and give business some certainty.  Just as Phil wants to stop living the same day over and over again, I think all of us want to break the cycle of short-term extensions of, in many cases, very popular tax policy. The legislation I introduce today with the ranking member, Senator Wyden of Oregon, is a critical first step toward helping taxpayers complete their 2018 returns and helping us begin work on a long-term solution to temporary tax policy.  I have asked our majority leader to rule XIV this bill onto the calendar, and I urge the House to send us a tax bill to address the extenders without further delay.  Just this morning, I had discussions with Iowa Congressmen of both political parties about this issue to contact the leadership of the House and the leadership of the Ways and Means Committee on the importance of moving legislation since the Constitution doesn't allow the Senate to move tax legislation in the first place. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to designate per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances as hazardous substances under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, Liability Act of 1980, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works."

                "speech":"Mr. President, during the debate on the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency I came to the floor to express concerns on a number of issues, including EPA's regulation of per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl substances--PFAS.  PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals developed in the 1940s. PFAS can be found across industries in many products, including food packaging, nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam used by the military. These chemicals have a long and tragic history--suffice it to say that their widespread use resulted too many Americans without access to safe drinking water.  This very issue is a matter of some controversy as EPA has failed to provide meaningful and swift action on these chemicals under this administration. That is why I am here today to introduce a bipartisan bill to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the Federal superfund law. The Carper-Capito-Peters-Tillis-Stabenow-Rubio-Merkley-Gardner-Reed-Murkowski-Shaheen-Burr-Bennet-Manchin bill will force EPA to begin the rulemaking process to protecting Americans from overexposure to these harmful chemicals and hold polluters accountable. It is very similar to legislation that has already been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.  In his confirmation hearing, Andrew Wheeler said, and I quote:       It is these Americans that President Trump and his      Administration are focused on, Americans without access to      safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous      sites, often unaware of the health risks they and their      families face. Many of these sites have languished for years,      even decades. How can these Americans prosper if they cannot      live, learn, or work in healthy environments? The answer is      simple. They cannot. President Trump understands this and      that is why he is focused on putting Americans first.  One would think those words might mean that there could be some common ground at least on addressing PFAS. After all, who wouldn't agree that we should be acting with urgency to address contamination from these hazardous chemicals?  According to one 2017 study, drinking water supplies for 6 million U.S. residents have exceeded the EPA's lifetime health advisory for these chemicals.  Another 2018 study performed by the Environmental Working Group reports that up to 110 million Americans could have PFAS-contaminated water.  In 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was assessing the risk of groundwater contamination from firefighting foam at dozens of fire and crash testing sites across the country. It is likely that they are all contaminated.  Just last year, the town of Blades in my home State of Delaware alerted its 1,250 residents, as well as businesses and schools that use public water, to stop using public water for drinking an cooking because PFAS chemicals were present at nearly twice the Federal health advisory level. Reportedly, 36 of 67 sampled groundwater wells on Dover Air Force Base showed dangerously high levels of PFOA and PFOS. And it is not just Delaware--contamination is widespread, in red States and blue States, in small water systems and large ones, on military sites and in residential areas, from Maine to Alaska.  It is essential that we legislate to require EPA to designate PFOA and PFOS as ``hazardous substances,'' which means that polluters could be held responsible for cleaning it up under the superfund law. In its recently released PFAS Action Plan, EPA has said again that it would issue this proposal in the future but did not indicate how long it will take to complete. Unfortunately, it has no sense of urgency to address these emerging contaminants and to protect American's from harmful levels of contamination.  EPA had an opportunity to take action to address PFAS chemicals in a real and comprehensive way; however, time and again, it has failed to move in an expeditious and meaningful way. That is why this bill is so important. Designating these chemicals as hazardous substances will, at a minimum, start the process to getting these contaminated sites cleaned up. This not the silver bullet to the broader contamination problems, but it is a start. A joint resolution calling on the United States and Congress to take immediate action to address the challenge of climate change; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I am joined this morning by a group of my Democratic colleagues to talk about the greatest threat facing our country and our planet--climate change. Despite the gravity and scale of the problem, at no time in the past 5 years have Republicans brought even a single bill to the floor to meaningfully address climate change. They brought CRAs to the floor to repeal critical environmental protections that limited the emission of greenhouse gases like methane. They brought legislation to open up more Federal lands to oil drilling, but they haven't brought forward a single meaningful bill to address climate change.  Ironically, the first bill Leader McConnell would bring to the floor on climate change is a bill that he and his party intend to vote against. What a ridiculous sham; what a pathetic political stunt. It would be a stunt on its own from a leader who just a month ago claimed he didn't bring sham bills to the floor, but it is an even greater stunt because they have nothing positive to say about dealing with this climate crisis.  So today, Democrats will be introducing a resolution to steer the direction of this conversation about climate change back in the right direction--all 47 Democrats, every single one.  We are introducing a resolution that affirms three simple things: First, climate change is real; second, climate change is changed by human activity; and third, Congress must act immediately to address this problem. These are three simple things--three things that the vast majority of the American people agree with. Two are plain facts, and the third is just a statement that Congress should take action in light of those two facts.  Our resolution does not prescribe what action we should take. It doesn't say that someone has to be for this solution or that solution. It simply states that climate change is happening, and we ought to do something about it. It is like saying that opioid abuse is a problem, and we should do something. Surely every Senator agrees with that.  In an ideal world, every single Republican Senator would sign on to our climate change resolution because there should be nothing controversial about it at all. But because one political party in America largely denies the science or, as I am sure my colleague from Rhode Island will address, is so in the pocket of Big Oil that it refuses to admit the severity of it, I suspect many of our Republican colleagues will not sign on, and what a shame--what a shame--that would be. At least the American people will know which of their Senators denies the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community.  So if and when Leader McConnell moves to proceed to the Green New Deal, Democrats will demand a vote on our resolution, and we will see if Leader McConnell is so eager to take that vote.  Again, I have asked him every day; I asked him earlier this morning: Leader McConnell, do you believe climate change is real? Leader McConnell, do you believe it is caused by human activity? And, Leader McConnell, do you believe Congress has to act to deal with climate change? We have simply heard silence from the leader and from just about every other Republican so far.  So we are going to push this resolution, and we hope the American people will let their Senators who are not on this resolution know that they should be on it. It is the first step to moving something in a positive direction because we intend to go on offense on climate.

                "speech":"Thank you for the recognition, Madam President.  Today I rise to call on this body to defend the Constitution, to protect the separation of powers, and to safeguard Congress's role as a coequal branch of government.  Today I am introducing a bipartisan resolution with my Senate colleagues to terminate the President's declaration of a national emergency to build his border wall.  My partners in this effort include Senator Collins, who is with me today. She will be here momentarily. Also partners are Senator Murkowski and Senator Shaheen.  I just want to say to Senator Collins that I commend her on her principled stance and on standing up for the Constitution.  The vote we will take on this resolution is historic. This is no longer about the President's wall. This is not about party. This is not about protecting the very heart of our American system. This is about protecting the very heart of our American system of governance.  Congress--and only Congress--holds the power of the purse. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution clearly states: ``No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.'' The Constitution is absolutely clear.  Congress's power to make spending decisions is very clear. There is no ambiguity. Deciding how to spend public funds is among our most fundamental powers and responsibilities under the Constitution. The Founders gave this power to the legislative body, not the executive, to ensure there is a broad support for how public funds are spent.  Consequential and far-reaching decisions about spending taxpayer money are not left to one person, not even the President.  This body has rejected the President's request to give him $5.7 billion for his wall along the southern border with Mexico. On February 14, not 2 weeks ago, we passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019 by a vote of 83 to 16. That compromise bill did not include the $5.7 billion the President wanted to build his wall.  Whether you believe Congress should fund the President's wall is not at issue. This is a question about the strength of the rule of law in this country and about the separation of powers, which forms the foundation of our American government.  The President's declaration of a national emergency is an end-run around Congress's power to appropriate--plain and simple. To quote Senator Collins, the President is ``usurping congressional authority.''  We are the representatives of the people. The people do not want to spend $5.7 billion on the President's wall, and we must protect their will.  Let's be clear. This emergency declaration has serious implications for States all across the country. To build this wall, the White House will raid $3.6 billion from the Department of Defense's military construction budget and $2.5 billion from that Department's drug interdiction program, but the White House apparently failed to realize there are only about $80 million in the drug interdiction account. So we should be prepared for a raid on other accounts or taking even more from military construction funding.  These are military construction funds that Congress already has appropriated for specific projects necessary to support the national security priorities of the United States. I am privileged to serve on the Appropriations Committee. I understand the hard and careful work that goes into these funding decisions.  From my home State of New Mexico, Congress allocated some $85 million to construct a formal training unit at Holloman Air Force Base in the south-central part of New Mexico for unmanned aerial vehicles. This investment in technology tracks terrorists and protects our national security. We allocated $40 million to the White Sands Missile Range to build an information systems facility badly needed for next-generation research and development activities at the range. Both of these projects were vetted over several years and deemed important to our national security.  New Mexico is not alone. Many States' military bases and regional economies will be impacted. Colorado, for example, is at risk of losing almost $100 million for construction projects at Fort Carson near Colorado Springs. Ohio risks $61 million for the first installment for building at the National Air and Space Intelligence Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.  Military construction projects totaling $210 million are at risk in Florida, $520 million in Texas, $81 million in Utah, and the list goes on and on. Projects in every corner of the country will be impacted.  According to the 1976 Senate report from the National Emergencies Act, the President's emergency power may ``be utilized only when actual emergencies exist.'' As a border Senator, I am here to tell you that there is no actual national security emergency at our southern border necessitating a massive wall along the southern border, as this body has already determined. This is a matter where the President and Congress have disagreed and the President is trying to overrule Congress by fiat.  A bipartisan group of 58 former national security officials are sounding the alarm. They write: ``Under no plausible assessment of the evidence is there a national emergency today that entitles the president to tap into funds appropriated for other purposes to build a wall at the southern border.''  The evidence speaks for itself. The number of border apprehensions has decreased dramatically. Since the early 2000s, southern border apprehensions have dropped 81 percent. The number of apprehensions at the end of fiscal year 2017 was the lowest it has been since 1971--a 46-year low. We have the lowest number of undocumented immigrants in our country that we have had in over a decade.  The Pew Research Center estimated recently that the total number of undocumented immigrants residing in the United States is far less than since 2004. That is a 14-year low. And more people emigrate to Mexico from the United States than immigrate from Mexico to here. That is right. We have a negative net migration rate with Mexico.  I am one of the four States that border Mexico--one of the four States that will be the most directly affected by a wall. I know for an absolute fact that there is no national security emergency along my State's border with Mexico. It is quite the opposite.  New Mexico's border communities are thriving. International commerce is thriving. Our multicultural communities are thriving. Crime rates are low.  A wall like the President wants would be disastrous for a State like New Mexico. It will seize away private property and carve up family ranches, farms, and homesteads. It will harm the beautiful but fragile environment there on the border.  Again, whether you support the President's wall is not at issue on this vote. As Senator Tillis put it in an op-ed in the Washington Post, ``I support President Trump's vision on border security. But I would vote against the emergency.''  Another Senate Republican Senator recently said, ``Congress has been ceding far too much power to the executive branch for decades. We should use this moment as an opportunity to start taking power back.''  Over 20 former Republican Senators and Representatives were compelled to pen a letter opposing the emergency declaration. They state: ``It has always been a Republican fundamental principle that no matter how strong our policy preferences, no matter how deep our loyalties to presidents and party leaders, in order to remain a constitutional republic we must act within the borders of the Constitution.''  The time to act is now. Litigation has been filed, but Congress should resolve the issue of our own constitutional authority and not wait for the courts.  Let me repeat. The vote we will take will be historic. It is imperative that all of us--Republican and Democrat--protect and defend our Constitution and that we protect and defend the checks and balances that unequivocally place the power of the purse with Congress and that we affirm our powers--powers that are separate from the President's.  Our oath is to uphold the Constitution, and the Constitution is clear. The Constitution does not empower the President to raid money by decree just because Congress has already said no.  I will vote to terminate the President's declaration of the national emergency to build his wall, and I will urge everyone in this Chamber to protect our constitutional prerogative and to do so as well."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the resolution that I am joining Senator Udall in introducing. It would reverse the President's ill-advised decision to declare a national emergency and commandeer funding provided for other purposes by Congress and instead redirect it to construct a wall on our southern border.  I thank Senator Udall for his leadership and also recognize the support we have received from our cosponsors, Senator Murkowski and Senator Shaheen.  Let me be clear. The question before us is not whether to support or oppose the wall. It is not whether to support or oppose President Trump. Rather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch now or in the future to hold a power that the Founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?  It has been said that Congress's most precious power is the power of the purse set out in plain language in article I, section 9 of our Constitution. It reads as follows: ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in consequence of Appropriations made by law.''  Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist 72, made clear the Founders' view that only the legislative branch commands this power, not the judiciary and not the executive. James Madison, in Federalist 58, called the power of the purse ``the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the [ . . . ] representatives of the people.''  Congress's power was jealously guarded in the early days of our Republic. No less an authority on our constitutional framework than Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, in his famous ``Commentaries,'' explained that ``[i]f it were otherwise, the executive would possess an unbounded power over the public purse of the nation, and might apply all its monied resources at his pleasure.''  Throughout our history, the courts have consistently held that ``only Congress is empowered by the Constitution to adopt laws directing monies to be spent from the U.S. treasury.''  I strongly support protecting the institutional prerogatives of the U.S. Senate and the system of checks and balances that is central to the structure of our government.  I support funding for better border security, including physical barriers where they make sense. I understand the President is disappointed that the funding he requested did not pass, but the failure of Congress to pass funding in the amount the President prefers cannot become an excuse for the President to usurp the powers of the legislative branch.  This is not the first time I have made this argument against Executive overreach. In 2015, I authored the Immigration Rule of Law Act, legislation that would have provided a statutory basis for the Dreamer population, while rolling back President Obama's 2014 Executive orders expanding that program.  As I explained at the time, even though I supported comprehensive immigration reform and was disappointed that it had not passed, I rejected the notion that its failure could serve as the justification for President Obama to implement by Executive fiat that which Congress had refused to pass, regardless of the wisdom of Congress's decision.  I would now like to turn to a discussion of the National Emergencies Act. This act was passed in 1976 to standardize the process by which the President can invoke national emergency powers and Congress can terminate the declaration through a joint resolution such as the one we are introducing today. The act is procedural in nature. It lays out the process the President must follow to declare a national emergency but does not provide the President with any additional powers. Instead, it requires the President to specify where, in existing law, he has been granted the authority for the powers he intends to exercise.  By itself, the National Emergencies Act does not give the President the power to repurpose billions of dollars to build a wall. The President must look elsewhere for that authority.  In his declaration, the President cites the authority provided by title 10, section 2808 of the U.S. Code, which relates to ``Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency.'' But that authorization applies only to ``military construction projects'' that are ``necessary to support [the] use of the armed forces.'' I do not believe this provision can be fairly read to bootstrap the presence of troops along the southern border into the authority to build a wall as a military construction project.  The question isn't whether the President can act in an emergency but whether he can do so in a manner that would undermine the congressional power of the purse.  Here, I think we need a better understanding of what should qualify as an emergency. One place we could turn is to a five-part test originally developed by the Office of Management and Budget in 1991, under former President George Herbert Walker Bush, to determine whether requested funding merited an ``emergency spending'' designation under our budget rules.  Under that test, a spending request was designated as an ``emergency'' only if all five of the following conditions were met:  First, expenditures had to be necessary; second, the need had to be sudden, coming into being quickly, not building up over time; third, the need had to be urgent; fourth, the need had to be unforeseen; and fifth, the need could not be permanent.  I raise this test only by way of analogy, but it is fair to say that whether or not you agree with the President that more should be done to secure the southern border--and I do agree with the President's goal--his decision to fund a border wall through a national emergency declaration would not pass this five-part test.  The President's declaration also has practical implications for the military construction appropriations process, as my colleague has pointed out.  Last year, in testimony before the Appropriations Committee, the Department of Defense said that the President's budget request for military construction funding was crucial to support our national defense, including construction projects to improve military readiness and increase the lethality of the force. This includes missile defense, improved facilities in Europe to deter Russian aggression, and infrastructure to operationalize the F-35 stealth fighter.  This also included several important efforts at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine that are vital to the Navy conducting timely maintenance and refueling of our Nation's submarines. Shifting funding away from these vital projects is shortsighted and could have very real national security implications.  We must defend Congress's institutional powers, as the Founders hoped we would, even when doing so is inconvenient or goes against the outcome we might prefer.  The gridlock we have experienced on difficult issues like border security and immigration reform is not simply a failure to get our work done but a reflection of the fact that we have yet to reach a consensus.  The President's emergency declaration is ill-advised precisely because it attempts to shortcut the process of checks and balances by usurping Congress's authority. This resolution blocks that overreach, and I hope, regardless of our colleague's position on the construction of the border wall, that we will join together to assert Congress's constitutional authority in the appropriations process.  I urge our colleagues to support this important resolution."

Simply put, this bill is nothing more than a thinly veiled power grab through more government, more regulation, and political speech repression. To call this legislation the For the People Act is borderline ludicrous.  H.R. 1 would eliminate States' authority to set voting qualifications, restore voting rights of convicted felons even if it contradicts State or local policy, outlaw voter verification, and force taxpayers to subsidize anonymous donations even if it is for a candidate they do not support.  This is just the tip of the iceberg. H.R. 1 is not for the people but, rather, an attempt to expand power to Federal bureaucrats and unelected Federal judges, undercutting the will of everyday citizens and the Constitution.

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, I am pleased that today we are considering H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act.  Yesterday, the House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, an important bill to expand our national firearms background check system to include virtually all gun transfers.  However, there are also steps we can take to make the current background check system more effective at blocking the sale of guns to individuals who are ineligible to purchase and possess them.  That is why I support H.R. 1112, a bill that addresses a dangerous shortcoming in the current firearms background check law.  In most cases, a licensed gun dealer receives notification within a few minutes, often 90 seconds, from the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, sometimes called the NICS, that a prospective buyer has passed or failed the background check.  In a small percentage of cases, NICS examiners may require additional time to complete the background check if information is missing or unclear in a prospective buyer's record. For example, there may be on the record a notation that the prospective buyer was arrested but no notation as to whether the buyer was acquitted or convicted. That would have to be looked into further.  However, under current law, a licensed gun dealer conducting a background check on a prospective purchaser is permitted to sell the firearm to the purchaser if there has been no determination from NICS after 3 business days, even though NICS has not indicated that the person has actually passed the background check.  Often, we refer to this as a default proceed transaction.  These are the very cases that ought to be investigated. In 2017 alone, the ATF determined that over 4,000 default proceed firearms transfers went to purchasers who should not lawfully have gotten them because they could not lawfully own a firearm.  If NICS is unable to return an instant determination, and especially if there is no report after 3 days, there is real cause for concern.  One notable example of the tragic consequences of this loophole is the hate crime murder of nine people at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.  In that tragedy, the shooter was not legally allowed to possess a firearm as a result of drug charges, but he still was able to purchase his gun from a licensed dealer, who made the decision to transfer after 3 business days had elapsed, despite not having received a definitive response from the background check system.  The bill before us today, H.R. 1112, would strengthen the background check procedures Federal firearms licensees or dealers must follow before selling or transferring a firearm.  Under this bill, the initial period a gun dealer must wait for an answer from the NICS is extended from 3 days to 10 days. If, after 10 days, the NICS system has not returned an answer to the dealer, the prospective purchaser may file a petition with the attorney general, which should help resolve most applications in short order.  If an additional 10 days elapses without a response from NICS, the licensed firearms dealer then may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser without the background check completion, if the dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from obtaining a firearm under Federal, State, or local law.  The additional time for checks to be completed will help prevent the transfer of guns to individuals who are ineligible to possess them and will make us safer.  I want to remind everyone that, in 90 percent of the cases, the NICS system gives the answer within 90 seconds. So we are talking about a small number of cases, but a number of cases where we know there have been tragic results. We want to stop that.  I commend our colleague Congressman  Jim Clyburn, the distinguished Democratic whip, for introducing this bipartisan bill, which is a sensible and necessary approach to addressing this dangerous shortcoming in current law.  Madam Chair, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill today, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, here we go again. Just like yesterday, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to criminalize the transfer of a firearm between two law-abiding citizens.  Today, they further reveal this interest by bringing up a bill that would prohibit law-abiding citizens from ever being able to acquire firearms. And that is not hyperbole, Madam Chair; it is fact.  Let me briefly explain how that would happen. Allow me to walk through the mechanics of this legislation.  Let's start at the beginning of the month. Assume I went to a Federal firearms licensee, an FFL, to purchase a firearm on Friday, February 1, of this month. Under H.R. 1112, the FBI's NICS system has 10 business days to respond to the FFL.  The tenth business day is a Friday, February the 15th. If, after those 10 business days, NICS does not okay the transfer, I must file a petition with the Department of Justice certifying that I have no reason to believe that I am prohibited by Federal, State, or local law from purchasing or possessing a firearm.  Once that petition is filed, the NICS system has an additional 10 days to make a determination. That would be Monday, March 5, in our example because February 18 was a Federal holiday and not a business day.  If, at the conclusion of the 20 business days waiting period, NICS does not deny the transfer, I could then acquire the firearm.  But wait, Madam Chair. Under existing law, the NICS background check is only valid for 30 calendar days from the date it is initiated. Under our example, that would be Saturday, March the 2nd, which is 2 days before my petition is required to be acted upon. At that point, I would be required to start the process over again entirely. There could be no end to this cycle.  Now, I am not sure if H.R. 1112 was written this way out of just messed-up writing or malice. I am not sure. But it does do this, and there is no mistaking what is written.  As I have said many times, we do not vote on aspirational ideas in this Chamber. They are great to debate, but we do not vote on aspirational ideas. We vote on words on paper, and words on paper are just as I have described.  I will let the American people determine what the intent was here. However, as I noted yesterday, in the rush to put this to the floor, they did not bother to fix some several major issues.  We also know, as we go forward in this that this indefinite and perpetual delay of the transfer of firearms to law-abiding citizens is perhaps the intent of this bill.  Keep in mind, under current law, an FFL has the option to transfer the firearm after 3 business days unless the transfer has been denied by NICS.  I would contend that 3 business days is not instant and a month is anything but instant, particularly as technologies continue to advance.  These laws have real-world consequences, and consequences can be deadly.  Carol Bowne was a New Jersey resident with a restraining order against her ex-boyfriend. Her application for a firearm took longer than 40 days to process, and he stabbed her to death while she was waiting to legally protect herself.  Let that sink in.  This bill would empower abusers and violent predators by making their victims more vulnerable.  Madam Chair, we oppose this legislation. It doesn't make sense in its current form. It will do nothing to make our communities safer, but it will make it harder for law-abiding citizens to exercise their Second Amendment rights and to defend themselves and their families.  Madam Chair, I am not often going to be able to say this, but I am joined today by the ACLU, who is opposing this bill and scoring against this bill.  It is not ready for prime time. It is ready to go back to actually have hearings and actually do markups and actually work with this bill.  I appreciate the gentleman, especially, from South Carolina's intent. No one fights stronger for his constituency than the gentleman from South Carolina. This is just not the right piece of legislation at the right time for the reasons that I spoke of, that have nothing to do with the intent. It has everything to do with words on paper. Remember, Madam Chair, that is what we vote on, not aspirational ideas.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time."

Madam Chair, let me begin my remarks, first of all, by welcoming to our Capitol today Miss Jennifer Pinckney and her two daughters. They are the wife and children of Reverend Clementa Pinckney, who, along with eight of his Bible study parishioners, lost his life to a demented white supremacist who said that he was interested in starting a race war.  He entered their church, participated in the Bible study, into which they welcomed him. And, as they closed their study that evening and prayed for what they had experienced and for their next meeting, this gentleman, while their eyes were closed, opened his and slaughtered them.  I find it interesting that my colleague has talked about the inconvenience of waiting longer than 3 days to purchase a weapon, without mentioning those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church.  He has talked about people who might be inconvenienced; he has talked about something he read in the newspapers; but he has not mentioned them. Well, I am here today to say that the Members of this august body need to think a little bit about the value of those lives.  Are they more valuable than the inconvenience a gun purchaser may have by having to wait 10 rather than 3 days to make a purchase?  What would make one so anxious to purchase a gun in the first place? If you have got to have a gun right now, chances are you have no useful purpose, no redeeming value, in the purchase of that gun.  Maybe we ought to participate here, as Members of this body, in helping this purchaser with a cooling-off period, which is all we are asking to do here.  Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the ``Holy City.'' Churches and steeples dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until recently, had an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher than 55 feet, wanting nothing to obstruct its steeples.  Faith is fundamental to the Charleston community. However, that faith was rocked in June 2015 when this lone gunman rushed into this Bible study, after having studied the most historic African American churches in the State of South Carolina and developing a list of five churches, one of which was Emanuel AME.  He, by his own admission, selected this church because of its importance to the African American community, being the first organized place of worship in the South for African Americans. He selected this. This was a hate crime of the first order, and we are saying we should not inconvenience him. And we did not inconvenience him. We allowed him to get that gun after 3 days, when it was around the fifth day that they found the glitch in the system and found him to be ineligible to own a gun.  We just had a gunman go into his workplace in Aurora, Illinois. He was ineligible to have a gun, but he was allowed to purchase the gun. When they found out that he was ineligible to have a gun, they then sent him a letter and said: Please bring us the gun back. You are not eligible to have a gun.  Give me a break. No, he didn't return the gun, because he had no redeeming value in having a gun. And he murdered his coworkers. And you are telling me we should not inconvenience him.  Well, my colleague, the chair of the committee, has laid out for you the procedure in this bill, a procedure that makes it a maximum, irrespective of what my colleague may say, it is a maximum of 20 working days, business days, that one would have in order to purchase a gun.  I would hope, as we move forward here today, we would think about those poor souls of Emanuel AME Church, and we think about those 4,000 people, 4,200 people, who purchased guns in 2016 using this loophole, and the 4,800 people who purchased guns in 2017 using this loophole. Think about their families. Think about their children. And think about what we are about to do here today."

                "speech":"Let me just take this minute to go back to what I had prepared to say here today.  In troubling times, many of us find solace in the Serenity Prayer: God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom--wisdom--to know the difference.  The Charleston loophole is something all Members of Congress should have the courage to change and, by doing so, grant the American people the serenity they deserve in their schools, in their entertainment venues, in their neighborhood streets, and, God forbid, in their places of worship.  Madam Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019.  Charleston, South Carolina, is nicknamed the Holy City. Church spires dominate the skyline of this historic city, which, until recently, had an ordinance that no building could be constructed higher than 55 feet. In this city, faith is foundational. It is a source of strength and community that dates back centuries.  However, that faith was rocked in June 2015 when a lone gunman punctuated his participation in a Bible study at Emanuel AME Church with gunshots fired upon the parishioners who had welcomed him, killing nine and wounding three others. The shooter targeted this place of worship because of its historic significance to the African-American community. This egregious hate crime shattered the sanctity of the Holy City, and in response Congress observed a moment of silence and all Americans offered thoughts and prayers.  While a moment of silence and our thoughts and prayers are appreciated in times of tragedy, they do nothing to solve the underlying problem. The real tragedy in Charleston is it could have been prevented. The gunman acquired the weapon used in the massacre because of a fault in the law that is now known as the Charleston Loophole. The gun purchase was subject to a background check; however, when a glitch in the system caused the background review to take more than the three-day limit allowed by law, the gunman was able to purchase the weapon, although it was later found that he was ineligible to purchase a gun. The system failed to stop this gun sale to an ineligible purchaser and 4,864 others in 2017.  It has been 25 years since the Brady Bill became law, and there has been no significant legislation enacted since to stem gun violence. Yet in 2017, 100 people were killed each day in this country with a firearm--which touches every district represented in this august body.  A vote in support of the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 extends the time allowed for law enforcement to conduct background checks. Under this bill, if the background check isn't concluded within 10 business days, the purchaser can request an expedited background check, which notifies law enforcement of the urgency of the review and starts an additional 10 business day period for the background check to be completed. While more than 96 percent of background checks are completed within three days--and 90 percent of Americans support background checks--this expedited review allows for law enforcement to complete the small percentage that may take longer than three days. If at the end of the expedited review the background check is inconclusive, then the purchase may proceed.  Restricting the Charleston Loophole doesn't prohibit law abiding citizens from purchasing a gun, but it does provide more time, if needed, for law enforcement to ensure weapons are not sold to those with criminal convictions or mental illness. This is an important first step our country should take to protect our citizens and their first amendment rights.  In troubling times many of us find solace in the Serenity prayer--God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference.'' The Charleston Loophole is something all Members of Congress should have the courage to change and grant the American people the serenity they deserve in their schools, entertainment venues, neighborhood streets and--God forbid--their places of worship."

But that terrible crime was committed 67 days after the perpetrator applied to purchase the firearm.  As Mr. Collins said, this was preventable if, under current law, it was a failure of the FBI and not of the law.  This bill is not about public safety. Most gun predators already get their firearms illegally. A recent Johns Hopkins study found that California's universal background check had no effect on gun violence.  Their true objective is to make gun ownership by law-abiding people so legally hazardous and so bureaucratically time-consuming that people simply give up. This bill cleverly and, I believe, insidiously sets up a potentially never-ending bureaucratic review process.  As Mr. Collins said, a background check is only good for 30 calendar days from the day you apply. But this bill sets up a 20-business-day delay process. Now, what that means is, if a single holiday falls within that window, or the store is closed on weekends, or you slip a single day on that timetable, your background check is no longer valid, and you have to start all over again in a perpetual cycle of Kafkaesque proportions.  Now, would a bureaucracy be so abusive as to play this game? Well, of course it would. Just ask Lois Lerner."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I support H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019 as a commonsense measure to improve the current firearms background check system and to save lives.  Twenty-five years ago today, we began implementation of the Brady Background Checks Act. The system it employs to run background checks on those seeking to purchase firearms from licensed gun dealers has made us safer.  Now it is time to address the circumstances in which the FBI needs additional time to investigate information relating to a prospective purchaser when the records may not be immediately clear as to whether someone is legally allowed to purchase a firearm.  Under current law, after 3 days, a gun dealer has the discretion to sell a gun to a purchaser, if the system has not given a green light to the sale after 3 business days have passed without a denial being issued by the system. In these circumstances, it is the choice of the dealer as to whether to proceed with the sale, which we call a default proceed, or whether to wait for the check to be implemented.  The results of such a choice were tragic in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015, when a young man filled with hate shot and killed nine worshippers at the Emanuel AME Church. The gun used in this murder had been transferred by a gun dealer to the shooter even though the check had not been completed by the FBI, but would have resulted in a denial had the check been finished.  This is not an isolated incident. Since 1994, gun sellers proceeded with between 3,000 and 4,000 default proceed sales per year. Analyzing data provided by the Department of Justice, one study found that such sales are eight times more likely to involve a prohibited purchaser than other background checks.  In 2017 alone, default proceed sales accounted for more than 4,800 transfers to purchasers who were prohibited from owning firearms. The FBI reported that, in 2007 and 2008, in cases a licensed seller sold a firearm through default proceed transfers---- The FBI reported that, in 2007 and 2008, in cases where a licensed seller sold a firearm through default proceed transfers, approximately 22 percent of the individuals investigated were legally prohibited from purchasing or possessing a firearm.  The additional time provided by H.R. 1112 is not too much to ask so that we may help prevent tragedies such as the Charleston shooting from happening. This is why I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill today."

This legislation is an attack on the constitutional rights of Americans. This bill puts incredible roadblocks in the way of law-abiding citizens seeking to exercise their Second Amendment rights that are guaranteed to them in the Constitution.  We should be focused on enforcing the current laws that we have on the books instead of passing Federal mandates that stifle freedom. This bill creates a bureaucratic maze that will allow the Federal Government to sit on its hands and force citizens to submit formal petitions to the Attorney General when they are trying to legally purchase a firearm, to ask permission to exercise their constitutional right.  What other constitutional right would you suggest we put this level of restriction on? The freedom of the press? The freedom of religion? Should we start having the Federal Government review every media outlet's story for 10 days before they can be published? before a church can meet for worship? I don't think so.  It is my hope that we will soon move forward with solutions, solutions that will actually make a difference for hardworking Americans across this great country.  When I was sworn in as a Member of the House earlier this year, I saw great potential for Congress to come together and advance solutions to our Nation's greatest problems. Instead, I find myself standing here on the floor of this Chamber fighting for the basic liberties that our Founding Fathers sought to guarantee for every American.

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Madam Chair, I rise today to fight for the rights of the brave men and women who have risked their lives fighting for our rights.  The bill we are debating, H.R. 1112, would have a significant impact on veterans' Second Amendment rights. A little-known and poorly understood provision of H.R. 1112 would amend the law to make it unlawful for an individual who has been ``adjudicated with mental illness, severe developmental disability, or severe emotional instability'' to purchase, to possess a firearm. It would make it illegal to sell a firearm to such an individual.  Let's put this in perspective. There are over 1.6 million disabled veterans with service-connected adjudication by VA of mental illness, including 1 million veterans with PTSD. H.R. 1112 has the potential to add all those names of veterans to the FBI NICS list and prevent those veterans from being able to purchase or possess a firearm.  Now, I know that may not have been the intent of the author of this bill, but that is a lot of veterans who will be impacted if this becomes law.  I offered an amendment at the Rules Committee to clarify that veterans with VA PTSD, diagnosed mental illness, and other affected adjudications would be exempted from the bill's standards, but it was ruled out of order.  VA already sends the names of veterans who have a VA fiduciary for inclusion on the NICS list--not because there is a concern that the veteran might be a harm to themselves or others, but because the VA has determined that the veteran needs assistance handling his or her financial benefits. I am concerned that the expanded definition proposed in H.R. 1112 would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of over 1 million veterans solely because they receive benefits from VA that they have rightly earned through their service to our great country.  The last thing any of us in this room want to do is to discourage veterans from seeking VA benefits and treatment because they are afraid it might cost them a constitutional right. Think about that.  Although there may not have been a finding by a judicial authority that a veteran poses a danger to themselves or society, these veterans will be told that they were good enough to use a firearm to fight for our freedoms, but they are not good enough to have the freedom to bear arms as a civilian.  That is wrong, Madam Chair. Even criminals must be convicted in a court of law before their names are added to the NICS list.  Of all Americans who deserve their constitutional rights, the most deserving are those who fought for our country. Madam Chair, that is why I strongly oppose H.R. 1112, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I thank Chairman Nadler for yielding.  Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019.  After losing my son Jordan to gun violence in 2012, I began reaching out to other families who recently lost a loved one to gun violence. I would send them letters. That is how I came to know Reverend Sharon Risher of Charlotte, North Carolina.  On June 17, 2017, Reverend Risher lost her mother, two cousins, and a childhood friend when a young man shot and killed nine people during a prayer service at the Emanuel Church in Charleston, South Carolina. Today, with H.R. 1112, we can close the loophole in background checks for the gun purchase that led to their terrible loss. I support this legislation for Reverend Sharon Risher and the memory of her family and her loved ones.  Tragically, this was not the last time our country witnessed horrific violence in a place of worship. A few months ago, the shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took the lives of 11 human beings.  Our places of worship, whether they are churches, synagogues, mosques, or something else, should be safe places of love, support, and community. H.R. 1112 would allow law enforcement the time that they need to make sure all these community centers are places of peace and safety.  Yesterday, we voted to expand background checks. Today, we vote to make sure those background checks are thorough, even if a few of them take a few more days to process. Those few extra days will save lives.  In the days after the Emanuel shooting, I was there in the community praying with the community and dealing with their pain and loss. America deserves better than this.  Why not make sure that we are doing everything that we can to protect them?

So it really makes sense to make it easier for people adjudged not to be proper to have a gun to have a gun if you are worried about suicides. That argument is, frankly, nonsensical.

Madam Chair, I would just point out in further support of Mr. Nadler's remarks, on average, 20 veterans commit suicide every single day in this country, and two-thirds of those suicides are caused by use of a gun. So Mr. Nadler is quite right.  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1112 to close the Charleston loophole.  We have heard a lot about what is at stake in terms of constitutional rights as it relates to possession of a firearm. There are other constitutional rights that are at issue here, and that is the right to life, liberty, the right to live free of gun violence and death, the right of a grandmother to sit on her porch and enjoy a summer evening free from the dangers of gun violence, the right of young children to play in a playground and play safely.  So this legislation is very important because it closes a very significant loophole in our law.  Over the last two decades, the Charleston loophole has allowed more than 60,000 purchases of guns by prohibited individuals.  Let that sink in.  Sixty thousand people who are prohibited from having a gun by law were allowed to get those guns because of this loophole.  One of those purchasers was a white supremacist who used the gun that he purchased to kill nine worshippers at the Mother Emanuel Church in South Carolina. Even though he had a felony drug charge on his record, this killer was able to buy a gun because his background check wasn't completed in 3 days.  And he isn't the only one, of course. A 2016 GAO report found that, between 2006 and 2015, guns were transferred to about 6,700 people with domestic violence convictions and more than 500 individuals with prohibiting protective orders.  So there are many, many examples where the American people are less safe because criminals and disqualified people can access a firearm because the background check wasn't completed in 3 days. This is a very simple commonsense solution to that problem.  Our laws will not work if we don't keep guns out of the hands of criminals, dangerous people, other disqualified purchasers, and this bill does that. This is a commonsense proposal.  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I thank Mr. Clyburn for his leadership, and I thank Mr. Nadler for bringing these bills before the Judiciary Committee so we can finally take some responsible action to reduce gun violence in this country."

Madam Chair, at this time I would like to address a concern that has been raised by one section of the bill that is unrelated to the changes to current law to address the Charleston loophole.  Section 3 of the bill replaces outdated and offensive terminology in the categories of individuals who are ineligible to purchase or possess firearms under current law. Among those included, there are individuals subject to such prohibitions because, as stated by the current law, they are ``adjudicated as a mental defective.''  At the Judiciary Committee's markup of the bill, we agreed with our ranking member, Representative Collins, to replace this offensive language and to insert different terminology in the bill as a placeholder as we work to develop alternative language that does not alter the scope of who is included in these prohibitions and to work with stakeholders who have an interest in how this would be accomplished.  We have heard from various advocates in the mental health, disability rights, and veterans communities who have expressed their desire to develop an acceptable alternative. We agree.  Yesterday, the Veterans of Foreign Wars brought their concerns related to this issue to our attention. The VFW agrees that the current terminology is archaic but is concerned about a potential unintended consequence of replacing it.  Their concern is that replacing these terms with ``mental illness,'' ``severe developmental disability,'' or ``severe emotional instability'' could result in some veterans who are not now included being added to the NICS index due to their receipt of VA care or benefits for mental illnesses such as PTSD or traumatic brain injury.  It is not the intent of the changes in this terminology made by section 3 to alter the scope of those currently considered to be ``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' It is the intent simply to replace that offensive language, but not to change the underlying law.  We will work with stakeholders, including the VFW, the mental health community, and the disability rights community to address the concerns related to this outdated terminology in a manner that does not change the scope of present law as this bill proceeds.

And, frankly, Ms. Lofgren, who was in the chair at the time, presented this language as an alternative to get us to a place where, as we talked about, we could get to Rules to actually fix this.  This is why I have said so many times that I have not--I understand the majority's willingness to bring the bill forward. What I didn't understand here is the willingness of this majority to put themselves on a time table to bring bills that were not ready. The reason we did it that night was so that we could get to Rules.  I served on the Rules Committee for 4 years. We could have fixed it at Rules.  Dr. Roe actually just brought an amendment to Rules, but it was rejected.  I understand that now we are going to continue forward.

Madam Chair, I can go back through my opening statement and list the many reasons I oppose this bill that have nothing to do with the amendment that should have been fixed by the time we got to Rules, which was agreed upon. Actually, the language was given by Ms. Lofgren and staff, and we said that we will take that and move to Rules to fix it.  If you go back and look at my statement, I am opposing this bill for many other reasons that are very valid. I believe when you look for timing, you look for other things.  Again, I believe working the process is proper. Working the process will go through. The majority brought this to the floor, and they should have the votes to pass it. If not, then the Senate can work on this language, and we go forward.  I think the bigger issue is the very fundamental issue of the timing of this bill, the timing that it is not just 20 days, and it is not just 10 days. There is another, when you couple it with the actual 30-day restriction on the application itself. So there are plenty of reasons for me to oppose this bill.  The other part was simply a discussion that should have been fixed and wasn't. That is a tragedy, that we are coming to the floor and that even be a problem. But at the end of the day, we pointed it out, we tried to, and that is where it is at.  My problem with this bill is the bill itself and much of the language that we have here.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and Mr. Clyburn, who, for years, has been working on this issue.  Madam Chair, H.R. 1112, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019, is long in coming. It responds to many people, but it responds to Dylann Roof.  In 2015, he went to a gun store to get a gun. He was not the normal purchaser, and it did not approve in 90 seconds, as most of them do. But in a day or two, when it had not yet been approved, Dylann Roof was able to get a gun. And Dylann Roof's whole message was: I am going to start a race war by going into an unlocked church on a prayer night and kill nine worshippers praying to their God and their pastor--whose wife was here today.  The question has to be: When are we going to stop the senseless killings and the eons and eons of mass shootings?  My good friend from Georgia (Mr. Collins) is a man of faith. I was in the committee room as a senior member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations as we were trying to deliberate his concern, a very vital concern, one that I have, to love people with disabilities, to love them and treat them with dignity.  The language in this legislation does that as best we could at the time, because it puts the language adjudicated, determined by some objective body, that you have a health problem that deals with a mental concern.  The question has to be, if it is not workable, you pass the bill. All of us have made a commitment to work through this process and to give dignity to every person, including veterans.  But at the same time, would you want to have a situation that happened with Dylann Roof, a convicted felon who grabbed a gun in 2 days and killed nine innocent people, or killed people in various other places, from Columbine, to Aurora, to Virginia Tech?"

                "speech":"Look at the stories of mass shootings, or look at the violence in cities where people are getting guns.  Madam Chair, I would make the argument that, today, we must pass H.R. 1112. The mercy of all of us dealing with issues to give dignity to those who suffer from illnesses that embrace mental illness concerns, it was because Mr. Collins, a man of faith, offered that suggestion. Therefore, we are going to move forward with the commitment to work it through and provide the dignity necessary, but to save the lives and to give tribute in death to those who lost their lives at the hands of Dylann Roof. Vote for H.R. 1112.  Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' legislation that would strengthen the background check system that is already in place to purchase a firearm.  I thank the Majority Whip, Congressman Clyburn, for introducing H.R. 1112 in response to the atrocity perpetrated at Mother Emmanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which killed nine members of one of the most historically significant churches in African American history.  One June 17, 2015, Dylann Roof was responsible for the mass shooting that took the lives of nine individuals at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church.  The victims were later referred to as ``The Charleston Nine'' and ``The Emanuel Nine''.  Under current law, after a prospective buyer completes the appropriate form, the holder of a Federal Firearms License initiates the background check by phone or computer.  If a determination is not obtained within three business days then the transfer may legally be completed by default proceeding and that is how Dylan Roof obtain the handgun he used to commit the killings, which he purchased from a retail store in West Columbia, SC.  H.R 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.  Under H.R. 1112, if the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days have passed since the initial background check, thus closing the so-called ``Charleston loophole.''  An internal assessment by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) demonstrated that the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (``NICS'') yields results that are approximately 99.3 percent to 99.8 percent accurate, and in 90 percent of cases, are processed within 90 seconds.  We must be constructive and proactive in our response to the countless mass shootings and gun violence in our country that continue to claim so many innocent lives.  Newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (``CDC'') found firearm-related deaths rose for the second-straight year in 2016, largely due to spikes in gun violence.  In 2016, the new CDC report on preliminary mortality data shows that there were more than 38,000 gun-related deaths in the U.S.--4,000 more than 2015.  An Associated Press analysis of FBI data shows there were about 11,000 gun-related homicides in 2016, up from 9,600 in 2015.  Congress must act to keep our country safe through gun safety and violence deterrence.  There is nearly one mass shooting per day in the United State--355 mass shootings in 2015.  In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and himself.  Since December 2012, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.  On the night of October 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire on a large crowd of concertgoers at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival on the Las Vegas Strip, leaving 58 people dead and 527 injured.  On November 5, 2017, a mass shooting occurred at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, where the gunman, 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, killed 26 and injured 20 others.  Every day, on average, 92 Americans are victims of gun violence, resulting in more than 33,000 deaths annually.  States with higher gun ownership rates have higher gun murder rates--as much as 114 percent higher than other states.  A recent study by the CDC looking at 30 years of homicide data found that for every 1 percent increase in a state's gun ownership rate, there is a nearly 1 percent increase in its firearm homicide rate.  Gun death rates are generally lower in states with restrictions such as safe storage requirements or assault weapons bans.  Mass shootings stopped by armed civilians in the past 33 years: 0.  This is why legislation put forward to arm teachers is not the solution.  Stronger legislation is needed to prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands because unfortunately, more than 75 percent of the weapons used in mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were obtained legally.  We must look at gun violence in its totality to determine what are the root causes of these alarming rates of lives cut short.  We are elected by our constituents to lead in resolving the issues that plague our country, and the issue of gun violence is a definite plague across the nation.  My good friend, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, gave a statement after four of his officers were shot while on duty.  He rightfully admonished us elected officials who, so far, have accomplished absolutely nothing about the public-health epidemic of gun violence.  Thanks to the new Democratic majority in Congress, we had a long overdue Gun Safety Hearing in the Judiciary Committee.  That hearing is the first step in the legislative process of addressing the epidemic.  Chief Acevedo was a witness at that hearing, testifying that if the proposed legislation on background checks is enacted and saves at least one life, then it is worth it.  Back in my state, despite incident after incident of rampant gun violence, Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Attorney General Ken Paxton, both prominent Republican opponents of gun control, issued the usual statements offering the usual thoughts and prayers.  Chief Acevedo said, ``I appreciate your prayers . . . but the question is, what are policymakers willing to do, besides prayers, to address a public-health epidemic?''  I want to answer his question--``what ARE we going to do?''  We are going to overcome the fierce opposition from House minority members.  We are going to overcome a recalcitrant and reluctant Senate.  And finally, we are going to overcome the opposition of the President and the gun lobby.  I am a defender and supporter of the constitution.  I appreciate the Second Amendment and the right that it provides our citizens.  However, I am also a defender of the right to live, the greatest divine right of all.  I want all Americans to enjoy their Second Amendment right, but not at the expense of the lives of our children, students, communities, and law enforcement officials.  Imagine going to grade school in this day and age and having to undergo ``active shooter'' drills.  Imagine having children in grade school today.  Imagine the anxiety parents feel knowing that any day the precious lives of their children may be interrupted by someone with an AK-47 or AR-15.  Imagine a brighter future for America's children, one that does not include active shooter drills and funerals for adolescents.  We can help make that future a reality and we can start by voting to pass H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,''"

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, in closing, we have had an interesting debate this morning. I think we went back on two points.  One, I believe I laid out the problems in a very methodical way on why this bill has serious defects in it that could possibly be fixed, if given long enough to work. I still may disagree with the premise of the bill, but it could have been worked out, when you actually take one part of law and combine it with another part of law. And we have seen a calendaring problem here. That is one part. That is the main part I have.  I think we have also seen how the process has not worked out again. Sometimes in life, getting it first is not best. Getting it quickly may not always be the best result. I think what we are seeing here is something that when we are dealing with the rights of individuals, especially in this area here and especially for the reasons that were given, which was a tragedy in Charleston that could have been stopped by the FBI that already had suspicions on not selling this firearm and could have went and taken that firearm, this is just a problem.  I have laid out as much as I can. I think the speakers have as well. There are many opposed to this. They will continue to be opposed to it, on both sides of the spectrum, our side from the perspective of our rights and those that are being violated, and the ACLU for what their reasons may be and others.  But it is time we had some honest discussion about what can actually deter this mass violence that we are seeing. Unfortunately, Madam Chair, we always speak of mass violence.  Why do we always have to go to the big violence? Why do we have to go to the ones who were killed that are tragedies that we all see? What about the ones that we can actually work on where we give better enforcement to our law enforcement, better prosecution of gun crimes, better prosecution that affects a single life in a neighborhood today? Is a single life not as important as the ones that we are not affecting now?  I think as we look forward, I would ask that this, of course, be voted down. I think we have laid out a reason why it at least should be considered by all Members before they put their card in that machine to decide why they are supporting a bill that we believe has some obvious flaws to it. It is not the intent of the individual offering it, but the actual words on paper have flaws in them. That is why we oppose this bill.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Chair, this is an important bill that addresses a significant, and tragically demonstrated, threat to public safety.  Today is the 25th anniversary of the implementation of the Brady Background Check Act. This lifesaving law has served us well, helping to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of those who are legally prohibited from possessing and purchasing them. But we know that some aspects of this law and the system that implements it must be updated and improved.  Let's remember what this bill does. All this bill does is give the FBI additional time--gives the NICS system additional time--to complete a background check in the 8 or 9 percent of cases where it is not done within 90 seconds. If you haven't gotten a background check back in 3 days, under this bill, you can't get it automatically, and you can't get the weapon automatically.  They have 10 days to do it. If after 10 days they still haven't done it, then you can petition the Attorney General. And if they still don't do it, get your firearm within 10 days. That will save a lot of lives.  We hear about mass shootings, but we also should remember that we are not talking about just mass shootings. Thirty-four people a day are killed in this country by guns--34 a day. Every other industrialized country in the world: 90 deaths with guns a year, 120, 170. The United States: 39,000.  How are we different? Are we thousands of times more mentally ill than people in Europe or Japan? No.  Are we more vicious? No.  Are our habits more degraded? No.  The difference is that this country is awash in guns. The difference is that, in this country, people who are dangerous can get guns.  These are modest steps. We should take much more advanced steps. We should ban assault weapons. We should ban large capacity magazine clips. But we are not doing that. We are starting with very moderate steps.  This is a very moderate step to improve the background check system. With all the rhetoric we hear, that is all it does. It gives a little extra time to make sure that someone who is dangerous, whose possession of a firearm is illegal, cannot get it.  Enacting this bill will save lives. I urge my colleagues to ignore all the nonsense rhetoric about extraneous considerations. Join me in supporting this bill today. Join me in supporting saving lives. Join me in making the United States a little safer to live in.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time."

This bill will strengthen our federal gun background check procedures by closing the ``Charleston'' loophole, thus ensuring that guns can no longer be erroneously sold due to incomplete background checks.  This epidemic of gun violence has left its scars on my home state of Texas. A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that there were 3,353 gun-related deaths in Texas in 2017 alone. Hundreds of these victims are children and teenagers under 19 years of age.  Our country has struggled with gun violence for too long, and the multitudes of loopholes in our laws are complicit in our difficulties. This bill will not only eliminate a significant loophole, but it will do so without infringing upon Second Amendment rights. It will ensure that only responsible and able individuals are able to purchase guns in our country.  I share our nation's concerns about the widespread proliferation of guns in our neighborhoods, and I agree that reasonable restrictions on firearms are essential to a comprehensive strategy to reduce crime and violence in our society. We must take sensible steps to ensure that these firearms do not fall into the wrong hands.  Furthermore, it has come to my attention that the mental illness reference in this bill may be outdated and not in line with current medical and legal standards. I will be reviewing this issue as we progress through the 116th Congress.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.-"

                "speech":"Madam Chair, Dylann Roof is a monster. Dylann Roof should never have been able to buy a gun. Dylann Roof walked into a church in my hometown of Charleston, South Carolina, my birthplace of Charleston, South Carolina, and he slaughtered nine people in a Bible study. I can't imagine a more horrific crime. We all, naturally, look for a response.  My friend, Mr. Clyburn, and the majority have noted that thousands of people have wrongfully acquired guns because of the failure of our background check system under what has become known as the Charleston loophole.  The stated purpose of this underlying legislation, Mr. Clyburn's legislation, is certainly noble: to close the Charleston loophole. The only problem is that it does not carry out that purpose.  Too often here, we take up noble causes; we create legislation with noble names; we pass this legislation to feel better; but the legislation fails to solve the problem in the title.  After these horrific murders, the families of the victims sued the Federal Government for allowing this monster to buy a gun. Charleston Federal District Court Judge Gergen wrote a lengthy opinion in which he laid bare the Federal background check process and its failures in this case, the case of Dylann Roof. His opinion is available for anybody to read.  And in his 22-page opinion, he lays out the various structural flaws in the background check system. Most notably, that the FBI maintains four criminal databases. And under the background check system, the background checker is allowed to check only three of those.  Why? I assume because those are the three that existed in the nineties when the background check came into place.  There is a fourth one. It is more extensive and it is more detailed. It is called N-DEx. In this file was all the information that Dylann Roof's background checker needed to know to deny him the right to buy the gun. This N-DEx system contained that information, and it is maintained by the FBI. All they had to do was allow this background checker to look at that. The FBI has admitted had they been able to do that, this man--this monster--would never have been able to buy a gun.  My amendment would actually fix the Charleston loophole. The problem is that I cannot support the underlying legislation. Why? Because it creates an undue amount of time to be able to buy a gun.  And number two, the thing that bothers me the most, is that it shifts a part of the burden to the American citizen trying to exercise his Second Amendment rights. It requires him, in the event that you don't hear back from the government, to file a petition with the Federal court. I think this is an undue interference with his Second Amendment right; therefore, I cannot accept this underlying legislation.  The Senate has indicated it will not be taken up in the Senate; and the President has indicated that, if it passed, he would veto it. Therefore, I plan to withdraw my amendment.  I plan to offer it separately as a new piece of legislation, which will, in fact, close the Charleston loophole. It will allow the FBI background checkers to search the most current N-DEx file that has all this detailed information that was created after 9/11, well after the background check law came into effect.  The FBI has admitted, it would have prevented Dylann Roof from buying a gun and, I suspect, many of the other people who have carried out these horrific shootings in recent years.  It will hopefully garner the bipartisan support necessary to actually become law and fix the underlying problem.  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment."

I also appreciate my friend from Texas, Sheila Jackson Lee, for her leadership on this issue as well.  Madam Chair, it is unconscionable to think that convicted felons, domestic abusers, and others who are prohibited by law from purchasing a firearm could end up with these weapons anyway. Sadly, this is the reality we currently live in due to the default proceed sales, also known as the Charleston loophole.  I have introduced legislation on this problem in the past because we must do everything we can to ensure firearms do not end up in the hands of those who should not have them. This is why I am also a cosponsor of Mr. Clyburn's Enhanced Background Checks Act.  The FBI should and, in fact, needs to know if a default proceeds sale has taken place. Currently, this is not the case unless the FBI eventually completes a background check, determines the purchaser should be prohibited from owning a firearm, and subsequently contacts the dealer.  We need more information throughout this process, and my amendment would do just that: require the FBI to report on the number of background checks that they are not able to complete within the designated time period.  This information will help keep track of the FBI's ability to clear background checks in a timely manner as well as give better understanding of where there is still room for improvement. It will also provide much-needed transparency to the default proceed process.

I think Mr. Schneider knows that why we are here on the floor is to save lives, to be able to protect innocent people from being subjected to what the Emanuel Nine were: worshippers in a church with their pastor, praying, as this country allows one to do.  It is my belief that the Schneider-Jackson Lee amendment should be passed, because with this critical data and compliance reporting we can learn more about legislative injustices like the one that enabled Dylann Roof to process a handgun used to murder the nine innocent persons at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, and to remind everybody he had not been approved by the NICS reporting system, and he was able to come back. This system allows us to know how many have not been approved, to be able to address the question, to have better policies dealing with protecting gun violence.  It is my privilege to join my colleague in supporting the Schneider-Jackson Lee amendment.  Madam Chair, I close by saying that this tracks the Accidental Firearms Transfer Reporting Act that I introduced in previous Congresses in H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57.  I look forward to working with my colleague as we expand reasonable gun safety legislation to protect our children, our families, and Americans.  Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of this amendment which I am proud to cosponsor with the gentleman from Illinois, Congressman Brad Schneider.  I thank the Rules Committee for making the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment in order and thank the Majority Whip for introducing the underlying legislation, H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019.''  H.R. 1112, the ``Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2019,'' would strengthen the background check procedures that firearms licensees or dealers follow before selling or transferring a firearm.  As under current law, firearms dealers would be required to run a background check on prospective buyers using the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (``NICS'').  Over 90% of NICS checks are completed within 90 seconds.  If the NICS system has not returned an answer to the licensed firearms dealer within ten days, the prospective firearms purchaser may file a petition with the Attorney General for review.  Then, after another ten-day period has expired, the licensed firearms dealer may sell or transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser if it has not received a response through the NICS system and the dealer has no reason to believe that the purchaser is prohibited from obtaining a firearm under federal, state, or local law.  Under this measure, licensed firearms dealers could not sell or transfer under the ``default proceed'' provision until at least 20 days have passed since the initial background check.  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment strengthens the bill by requiring the FBI to report on the number of petitions on which it was not able to make a determination regarding the eligibility of the transferee to possess a firearm within the 10-day period allotted by H.R. 1112.  I urge my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment because, with this critical data and compliance reporting, we can learn more about legislative interstices like the one that enabled Dylan Roof to possess the handgun used to murder 9 innocent persons at Mother Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as the numerous other cases where a firearm was handed over to an unintended and potentially dangerous recipient.  Making sure that policy makers have the most accurate, reliable, and current data regarding background checks is one of the main reasons I introduced the Accidental Firearms Transfers Reporting Act in the 114th and 115th Congress (H.R. 3125 and H.R. 57 respectively).  Madam Chair, if anything, it is gun violence that is a national emergency, and reducing gun violence should be one of Congress's highest priorities.  The Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment will help to do that.  I ask my colleagues to support the Schneider/Jackson Lee Amendment in order.  Again, I thank Majority Whip Clyburn for introducing the underlying legislation and Congressman Schneider for his work on this salutary amendment.

In 2017, 39,773 Americans died from gun violence. This is a public health epidemic.  Under current law, if a background check is not completed within 3 business days, a federally licensed firearm dealer may move forward with a firearms transfer or sale.  The devastating reality is that many horrific acts of gun violence, including the massacre of the Emanuel Methodist Church in Charleston, South Carolina, which ended nine lives and left several people wounded, could have been avoided.  Today, we will vote to close the loophole that allowed for that tragedy by closing what has become known as the Charleston loophole. The Enhanced Background Checks Act will provide the background check system with additional time to make a final determination on a potential firearm purchaser before a licensed dealer can transfer a gun.  We have an obligation to the American people and to the victims of the shooter at the AME church to pass the bill before us today, and I am proud to be part of this effort to protect our communities from gun violence.  My amendment to H.R. 1112 will require the Government Accountability Office to submit a report to Congress 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years following the implementation of this law. These reports will analyze the extent to which the changes made by this law will prevent firearms from being transferred to prohibited persons.  I am proud that this amendment has broad support from all stakeholders that have been involved in making this bill a reality.  We must strive for effective, evidence-based policies that promote public health and protect our communities. My amendment will cost us nothing, but it will help build the evidence base around the effectiveness of good gun violence prevention policies like this one.  This amendment is all the more important, given the regrettable lack of Federal funding for gun violence research. My amendment will finally help us demonstrate with data that gun violence prevention measures like the one before us today will prevent firearms from ending up in the hands of people who should not have them.  I came to Washington because the people of southern Macomb and southeastern Oakland Counties sent me here on a mission, and that mission includes protecting our communities from senseless gun violence.  I stand today in solidarity with the courageous people of Michigan's Ninth Congressional District's Moms Demand Action and Students Demand Action.  We have a responsibility as Members of Congress and as human beings not just to talk about the horrors of gun violence, but to do everything in our powers to end it. Today, we will take the critically necessary step to do just that.  I would like to thank Congressman  Jim Clyburn, Peter King, and Joe Cunningham for their leadership to ensure that we close the Charleston loophole. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1112 and support this amendment.  Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee."

Madam Chair, when we discuss the epidemic of gun violence in our country, we must confront the issues of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  According to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, firearms pose a significant danger to victims of domestic violence, and this is true no matter who owns the firearm. Research shows that a male abuser's access to a firearm increases the risk of intimate partner femicide fivefold and does not support the contention that firearm possession is a protective factor for the victim.  The fact is, prohibited buyers who obtain a firearm through the Charleston loophole are disproportionately likely to be prohibited because of domestic violence. Indeed, in 2017, 23 percent of cases where a gun was transferred to a prohibited purchaser through a default proceed sale involved a person prohibited due to a conviction for domestic violence, or prohibited due to a domestic violence restraining order.  Denials related to domestic violence often require more investigation than denials based on other factors.  I am offering this amendment so that this bill's background check process, before it goes into effect, Congress can hear from experts in the Justice Department and at the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms on whether any changes could be made to better protect victims of domestic violence.  This amendment requires the study on domestic violence to be completed within 150 days. If the Van Drew amendment passes, this bill will have an effective date of 210 days after enactment.  If the study finds that further changes would be advisable to better protect domestic violence victims, Congress will have enough time to make those changes.  Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore)."

Madam Chairwoman, I am here on the floor today with the hopes that my colleagues will listen to the 10 million men, women, and children who experience domestic violence each year. Domestic violence is a horrible scourge, and the presence or possession of a gun only worsens these tragedies.  You heard my colleague, Representative Porter, say that women are five times more likely to die or be killed in a domestic violence situation if a gun is owned, which is one of the reasons, Madam Chair, I have introduced legislation to help incentivize States to adopt laws that ensure that we do everything to take guns from those with a court restraining order or other protective order.  I hope, Madam Chair, that my colleagues will listen to the one in three women and one in four men who have been victims of intimate partner violence. I sure hope that my colleagues will listen to me as one of the 4.5 million women who have experienced gun violence firsthand.  There is much discussion in these Chambers about a national emergency. Gun violence and domestic violence are a national emergency, and that is why we have offered this amendment so that our laws actually reflect the realities.  The data collected will be critical to inform Congress about ways to prevent needless tragedies in our country, and to help us evolve in a way that will more accurately protect our constituents."

My amendment will ensure that from the date a firearm purchase is legally authorized under the bill, the firearm purchaser has 25 calendar days to pick up their gun, regardless of how much time has elapsed since the background check was first initiated.  This would prevent a situation under the bill as it is written that, although rare, would still be possible, where the maximum allowable number of business days, 20 business days, that a purchaser would have to wait for an approval could actually run longer, hypothetically, than the 30 days.  That would be problematic because under a current ATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulation, a gun cannot be transferred after 30 days once a background check begins.  Where more than 30 calendar days have passed since the licensee first contacted NICS, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the licensee must initiate a new NICS check prior to transferring the firearm. My amendment would prevent an unnecessary background check do-over.  For those who get approved by the FBI after 3 business days, my amendment would essentially nullify the 30 days ATF regulation, allowing prospective firearm owners the peace of mind that they do deserve.  After this bill went through the Judiciary Committee, the point was raised that an existing ATF regulation, if left unchanged, could result in a situation where even after a background check was approved or a petition process was followed, the lawful gun buyer would still not be able to get the gun without doing a second background check because too much time had elapsed since the first background check began.  This is clearly not the intent of the bill, and while I believe that ATF would amend the regulation if this bill is passed, this amendment removes all doubt. Anyone who is legally authorized to obtain a firearm under the new process will have ample time, 25 days, to return to the dealer and retrieve the gun.

But the only problem is, it doesn't fix it--I think that is the problem that we are looking at--as written. As we discussed earlier, your amendment claims to prevent this endless loop, but it fails to do so.  Per ATF regulation, a NICS check is only valid for 30 calendar days from when the NICS is initially contacted. This language does not extend the timeframe in the event of a delayed response, nor does it direct the attorney general to do so.  So if the purchaser completes the three-step process under H.R. 1112, then attempts to take possession of the firearm on calendar day 31, ATF regulations would suggest it is too late. The NICS check has expired, and as a result, the federally licensed firearms dealer would need to conduct a new NICS check while restarting the process.  Madam Chair, I did offer an amendment to extend the validity of the NICS check to 60 days to cure this deficiency, however, the Democrats refused to make my amendment in order. For that reason, I am glad that the gentleman is trying to fix this, which is where it should be, but it just doesn't fix it.

Because this says that the transfer can take place for 25 days after the transfer becomes legally permissible.  In other words, under the longest timeframe, the background check doesn't come back within 10 days. The purchaser waits a few days, and then petitions the attorney general. It takes another 10 days. Then it becomes legally permissible.  This says the transfer can take place for 25 days after that. So there is no way that this doesn't take care of the problem that Mr. Collins raised, and then some.  The current procedures in place do not take into account the longer waiting period in the petition process that H.R. 1112 requires. This amendment more than takes care of that.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, this motion to recommit will not kill the bill or send it back to committee, to be clear. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.  My Democratic colleagues are set to pass this bill despite the fact that the ACLU opposes it.  Let me repeat that. The ACLU opposes H.R. 1112 because it is so sweeping and improperly perpetrates unfounded assumptions that people with mental disabilities should be considered dangerous and are prone to violence without any meaningful due process.  As most of you know, I am a survivor of domestic violence, and that is why this motion to recommit is so personally important to me. This motion to recommit, in contrast, is narrowly tailored. It would simply allow victims of domestic violence who go through a NICS check to receive their firearms in 3 days, which is the status quo, if NICS has not responded with a denial or approval in 3 business days--again, the status quo.  Do we really want to tell victims of domestic violence they have to wait up to 20 business days, which is under this bill, before they are allowed to adequately defend themselves?  Do we really want to tell them: Sorry. I know you are purchasing a firearm to protect yourself, but you have to wait 20 business days?  Should we tell them: Hopefully you can hide from your abuser for the next month?  The Judiciary Committee recently heard testimony from a young woman who was raped on her college campus. She did not have a gun on campus because the State did not allow her to carry a gun in order to defend herself. This is a clear example of how law-abiding citizens, not criminals, follow the law and how this law-abiding young woman was harmed by gun control laws.  Another specific example related to this bill of a well-intentioned law gone wrong is Carol Bowne, a New Jersey woman stabbed to death while waiting to be approved for her firearm application. She already had an order of protection from the courts, but that wasn't enough for her. She needed more than just that piece of paper. She needed to protect herself, so she went and tried to get a gun to defend herself, but because of the waiting period, she was killed.  Let me repeat that. Carol Bowne had an order of protection. She attempted to purchase a firearm, and she was tragically murdered by her abuser while waiting to be approved.  H.R. 1112 will make the realities of Carol's story happen across the country, putting millions of women and law-abiding citizens in danger. Women who seek avenues of protection will be forced to wait almost a month, like Carol.  How many women will potentially suffer like Carol? And what will the Democrats say: Sorry; we hope you can hide from your abuser for a month?  Madam Speaker, that would be foolish as well as heartless. It would be an infringement of Second Amendment rights for someone who needs them the most.  Given the insidious flaws in this bill, do we really want to burden law-abiding victims by placing them in a never-ending cycle of background checks? Of course not.  This motion to recommit is a commonsense measure. It would ensure that domestic violence victims, many of whom live in fear, can receive the protection they need and deserve.  Vote for this motion to recommit and you vote to protect domestic violence victims. Vote against the motion to recommit and you are telling victims who live in fear: Sorry; we won't help you.

We have discussed it here today, but I will repeat, the very name ``Charleston loophole'' is a grim reminder of the deficiency in current law that allows killers to get guns even if a firearms background check has not been completed. This is a dangerous flaw that we can address with a minor change to the system.  When a background check cannot be completed within a 3-day period, it is important that the FBI work to resolve the unanswered questions presented, because these are the very cases that present the most danger.  Unfortunately, we have seen many default proceeds go forward in domestic violence cases, allowing an abuser to obtain a firearm even when he or she is prohibited from owning one. The statistics back that up.  In 2013 and 2014, a plurality of default proceed transfers to prohibit a person were related to domestic violence. In that same period, 30 percent of denials due to convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence were issued after the abuser took possession of the gun.  My heart goes out to my colleague, Mrs. Lesko, because she should never have suffered from domestic violence. Unfortunately, we are colleagues that both know it.  I have spent more time thinking about how you keep guns out of the hands of abusers, probably, than anybody in this Chamber. I know better than most the dangers they pose.  It is not easy for me to talk about it this week, but more than once--and I think of the abuser. I will be honest on this floor. My father was mentally ill. I had to hide in that closet with my siblings wondering if we would live or die. One night, I kept my father from killing my mother. He shouldn't have had a gun.  This is what I remember as a child. My mother went out and bought a gun, and then all of us were scared to death about her gun and my father's gun. We had two guns to worry about.  No child, no woman, no man should ever have to go through that.  The additional time provided by H.R. 1112 will help us stop more massacres such as the one in Charleston, and may it prevent another child or family going through what I did as a child.  These amendments made by this motion would undermine the lifesaving improvements to current law that this bill will initiate.

While their heads were bowed and their eyes closed, Dylann Roof opened his, after having been welcomed into their midst, and he slaughtered Reverend Pinckney and his eight worshippers.  Why? Because he was allowed to get this gun when he was not eligible to get one. They found out on the fifth day that he was ineligible but, by that point, it was too late.

Today, I had the honor and the privilege of voting on a bill that would make our streets safer--not solve every problem, but reduce the amount of crying and dying that goes on in too many communities around America.  I must say this--and it is unfortunate to have to clarify--because I am Latino, people are assuming that the person who shot Rudy was a Latino or a Black male or what have you. He was not. He was a young man--a victim, himself, of drug abuse--a White young man.  It should never happen to anyone, and people should never assume that it only happens to certain people in certain communities. Tens of thousands of human lives are lost every year in the greatest country, America, and we need to make it better."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an unsung hero in Florida's history.  In 1858, James Dean was born into slavery in Ocala, Florida. In pursuit of his dream to enter public office, Dean entered Howard University School of Law working part time as a clerk to put himself through school.  He earned a bachelor's and master's of law, graduating as the valedictorian in both degrees. After graduating, Dean returned home to Florida in 1887, taking a position as a school principal and establishing a law practice in Key West.  His practice grew so quick that he had to resign from the school within a year to care for his clients. As his business grew, so did his standing in the community. In 1888, just a year after moving to Key West, he was nominated to serve as a county judge.  This didn't sit well with many White political leaders in Key West who conspired to have him removed from the bench. They fabricated a story that Judge Dean illegally married an interracial couple and the Governor of Florida removed him from office.  As Black History Month comes to a close today, it is important to not shy away from uncomfortable moments in our history. And while Governor Bush posthumously reinstating his judgeship in 2002 can never make up for the harm suffered, remembering his story makes us all more sensitive to current injustices suffered by our friends in the Black community."

I would also like to thank Senator Pat Roberts for his important leadership on this issue.  The bill that passed this week honors the significant history of Quindaro, which served as a key stop on the Underground Railroad and helps preserve the site for future generations.  Quindaro is an important part of United States and Kansas history in the fight for freedom and equality. It serves as a reminder of a dark chapter in our Nation's history.  Sadly, for too long, the Quindaro Townsite has lacked proper investments needed to preserve it as a historic site. But the community leaders in Kansas never gave up on fighting for Quindaro, people like Marvin Robinson a Kansas City, Kansas, native who spent over 30 years working for this legislation to pass.  He now plans to use the site to improve racial relations in the community and to educate people about our shared history.  Madam Speaker, I am proud to protect Quindaro's history and keep its stories alive for future generations."

Criminals don't honor gun laws. They steal. They commit murder, all sorts of crimes without permission. They don't seek permission when they take something from you, when they enter your home.  They don't seek permission to become gun owners. Yet, what happens here in the legislation this week, limits the rights, limits the ability for people to defend themselves, defend their own homes, defend their own families, by having less options or less ability to get a weapon if they need it, especially timely.  These measures do not work. They do not work to stop the shootings that are often cited as the reason to deny people their Second Amendment rights in this country.  Indeed, it is a political agenda that gets pushed in every election, every possible time in legislation, and finally, with the majority they have, they are able to push this stuff through and harm innocent Americans and their ability to defend themselves.

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, I do appreciate the Speaker's new policy that says a Member of Congress can only have one Special Order in which they are in charge of the time each week once a week. I have been trying to get Republicans to take our time, much in the way my colleague, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the group they call the ``30 Somethings'' did in 2005 and 2006.  I have not had a great deal of success in getting a lot of people to take Special Order time. But with this new rule and some of the terrific freshmen that we have got who have come in--some of the folks who have been here a term or two--they are stepping up and taking our time to discuss critically important issues for our country. Today, I am it from our party, and I am honored to be here.  We have heard a lot of talk, and the reason we say have heard a lot of talk is because there is truth in seeing a double standard at the Department of Justice for a number of years now.  There was a time when it was the Department of Justice that Jeff Sessions remembered back in the 1980s during his time as U.S. attorney. That time changed with top people in the FBI and top people in the DOJ; it became no longer about justice, but just us and what we want at the DOJ and the FBI.  In talking to former Justice attorneys, prosecutors, one dear friend in Texas--not in my district, but a very dear friend--we were talking about how the things that were done by people, including Rosenstein, the former U.S. attorney, McCabe, Strzok, Page, all of these other people, Ohr, were incredible, just incredible, and I would include Mueller in that.  Mueller as FBI Director, I continue to believe did more damage to the FBI during his 12 years as the director of the FBI than anyone, even the problems that J. Edgar Hoover created, especially in his later years, the wiretapping that he did of people who should not have been wiretapped. Of course, he didn't just do it on his own. As I recall, Attorney General Kennedy had supported wiretapping of Martin Luther King, Jr., if I remember correctly.  But what we have seen in the unmasking of American citizens who have been followed by email, by wire--not taps, but just following their conversations as the NSA and our intelligence community is able to do these days, is absolutely incredible. Hundreds and hundreds of Americans were unmasked. We were assured with the PATRIOT Act when it was up for being reauthorized, oh, no, we are so careful to make sure that we don't capture Americans that should not be captured unless they are involved with a terrorist organization or a known foreign terrorist. They don't get picked up.  But now, if they are talking to a terrorist, a known foreign agent, then it is possible they could be picked up, but those names are masked. They are never unmasked. That is too big of a burden. And then we find out under the Obama administration, the American people have had their privacy violated, like Democrats and Republicans alike swore to us would not happen. Well, it has happened. And it has continued to go on.  I had hoped that Christopher Wray would clean things up at the FBI, but he appears to be more concerned about covering up problems rather than cleaning up the problems. I saw a good example of that at the end of August when, once again, the intelligence community had made clear they sent their investigator, Frank Rucker, over to explain to Peter Strzok, as head of the FBI's counterintelligence--and also Dean Chappell, their liaison--to explain that we now have 100 percent proof, there is no question, Hillary Clinton's private email server was hacked.  They embedded a direction into her server that forced every email coming in and going out into what has now been disclosed publicly by others as a Chinese intelligence agency front.  They were getting every one of Hillary Clinton's--over 30,000 emails to and from. There were four that were glitches, but otherwise, over 30,000 emails. So that must include the ones that President Obama sent using another name so people wouldn't realize it was him using a private server.  But there were also the President's daily intelligence briefings that went through her home. She had somebody at the home print them out for her without any security clearance. There were all kinds of violations, what appeared from the code to be outright crimes, but the double standard appears to continue.  This is from February 25, an article from CNS News, Terence Jeffrey reported that the inspector general says, ``Prosecution Was Declined for Senior DOJ Official Who Sexually Assaulted a Subordinate.''  And it goes on to talk about that. The name is not disclosed. He sexually harassed subordinates, sexually assaulted yet another subordinate, and then lacked candor. That is the DOJ's explanation for people they don't want to prosecute when they are actually saying that he lied, committed a crime, but lied when the IG investigated this matter.  So the unnamed prosecutor or prosecutors were not disclosed, but allowed to retire, no consequences, though guilty of sexual assault in the DOJ.  Now, there were a lot of things I disagreed on with a late, former Federal judge in Texas named William Wayne Justice, but one thing I agreed with him on, and I heard him tell people: ``You, of all people, especially, knew better.''  And he would come down harder on somebody like this who had been part of the DOJ. I would imagine Judge Justice, if he were around, he would throw the book at somebody who worked at Justice and still committed crime and abused the system. I can just hear him still today coming after somebody like that.  But not in the DOJ. We have got lots of carryover from the Obama years, and I know my friend, Jeff Sessions, called them career people because they were in career slots. But he was talking about people who loved Sally Yates, thought she did the right thing in refusing to defend constitutional positions taken by the Trump administration.  Yet, many of those people are still there undercutting President Trump, undercutting Matt Whitaker when he was acting, and will, no doubt, be undercutting Attorney General Barr.  So this is a real problem when the Justice Department, the one we counted on for many decades now, if there was something wrong, whether it is civil rights or others, and justice could not be found, the Department of Justice could be counted on to come in and pursue real justice, to their credit.  FBI agents and prosecutors, some retired now from the Department of Justice, have privately conveyed to me their broken hearts over the damage done to the Department of Justice and to the FBI because they became so calloused, so self-absorbed, and so political that they have damaged not only the FBI and not only the Department of Justice, but this country.  But when you have willing allies in the alt-left media--or some call them the mainstream media; certainly, alt-left these days--it is understandable that same feeling of desperation is felt by the American people: Where do we turn when the Justice Department is not honest?  It used to be you could trust the media. You could find somebody who would do such great investigative journalism that they would get to the heart of it and bring something to the forefront, to the point that the American people would justifiably become outraged, and that would force either elected or appointed Federal officials with the Federal Government to do something.  But here we have alt-left, lamestream media saying that there is no crisis on our border. Yet if you look at the same things said by Obama officials about the same problems, except now exacerbated on our border with all the caravans that have come, are coming, and are continuing to be established in Central America, it is amazing how some of these media outlets can even continue to call themselves journalists.  An article from Brian Flood, January 10, this year, points out that: ``News outlets readily described a `crisis' at the border under then-President Barack Obama when he sought funding to deal with a surge of migrants, many of them women and children. But now that President Trump is in the White House, the mainstream media seem far more reluctant to use the word.  ``Back in the summer of 2014, the headlines and stories referring to the C-word''--apparently the crisis word--``were plentiful as the border surge was taken seriously along the Acela corridor.  ``The Washington Post''--now an alt-left medium--``wrote in 2014, `White House requests $3.7 billion in emergency funds for border crisis' ''--there is that C-word, crisis--``while CNN published a feature, `Daniel's journey: How thousands of children are creating a crisis in America.' It described a problem of `epic proportions.' ''  Now, they point out that: ``Around the same time, the Huffington Post declared that `photos of the humanitarian crisis' ''--even Huffington called it a crisis--``along the southern border were `shocking,' and ABC News reported that Obama requested `$3.7 billion to cope with the humanitarian crisis on the border and the spike in illegal crossings by unaccompanied minors from Central America.' ''  The ABC News story even mentioned this word to deal with plans for $3.7 billion. This was ABC's headline: ``Immigration crisis funds.'' Incredible.  NBC, June 2014, Andrea Mitchell said the undocumented children flooding the border were, in her words, ``creating a crisis'' for authorities.  How these news outlets can turn around and now say that there is no crisis when the testimony and the evidence is clear that the overall numbers for last year may have been down, but as the testimony and evidence makes clear, in October, November, December, and January, those numbers spiked to numbers that our Border Patrol has not dealt with before for minors and family units.  Why would they all of a sudden spike during that time? Because it appeared the Democrats had a chance of taking the majority here in the House, and in so doing, Democrats have made clear they wanted to continue to allow illegal immigration. They welcomed the families. Naturally, you were going to see a spike.  These people below our southern border in Mexico, Central America, South America, and now coming from the Middle East and other continents, have been coming for some time from other countries. They are being lured in.  The head of the Border Patrol testified this week in our committee that they were being pulled in. But really, it is being lured. They hear: Gee, if we will just come now, we have people who are in charge of the House of Representatives who want us there, and they are going to try to stop the President from enforcing and securing the border, so now is the time to come.  And they are coming. We heard the testimony that about 80 percent of the people who came across our borders in decades past were normally male adults. It made sense. Usually, it was people who were coming looking for work, and they were going to send money to their families back in Mexico. But the word got out the end of last year and this year that if you will come and bring a minor child, whether it is your child or not, then you have a good chance of staying in the country.  We know that nobody crosses our border illegally on the south unless they have gotten permission by paying the drug cartels. Over and over during the nights I have spent on the border, the question has been asked: Where did you get the money to pay to come?  Oh, 1,000 here, 1,000 from people in the U.S.  Well, what about the rest of the money you have to pay?  The drug cartels are going to let me work it off when I get where I am going.  They would normally have an address. As I understand it, that is often the address the drug cartel told them where they would need to go get set up and work off what they owed to the drug cartels.  But, Madam Speaker, you shouldn't be surprised when you see headlines like: Meth lab in major U.S. city busted, run by drug cartels.  As the Department of Homeland Security folks have pointed out to me before, the drug cartels call us their logistics. All they have to do is get somebody illegally into the country, and they hand us the address of somebody supposedly that they know where they can go live, and we handle the shipping for them. We ship them to wherever they want to go. Sometimes, they are detained, but we have shipped millions of people around, all over the country.  If what they have told the Border Patrol about working off what they owe the drug cartels is true--I haven't seen or heard any reason it wouldn't be--then our Homeland Security Department for a decade or so has been shipping people to the location where the drug cartels want them. The drug cartels are making billions and billions of dollars a year.  When you hear any Mexican or Central American official who says they want to keep the American border open, you can just pretty well guarantee they are getting money from the drug cartels.  The best thing, the most caring and loving thing, we could do for our neighbors to the south would be to secure our border, put border barriers where they need it, whether it is a wall, a 30-foot barrier, whatever. Secure the border and then that will cut off the billions of dollars of American money going to the drug cartels for them to terrorize people in Mexico and people in Central America.  You care about people south of our border. Of course, we can't bring in all those millions who are suffering under drug cartel rule and reign, but we could secure our border and cut off the domestic terrorists called the drug cartels, cut off their funding so they won't be able to pay people to cut off the heads of police chiefs or mayors who take a strong stand against the drug cartels and put those heads on a pike as an example to anybody who tries to stand up against the cartels.  It used to be that the drug cartels had a deal. It was just kind of a policy that they are not going to allow any kind of crime or violence to tourists because that is too important for Mexico to have those tourists' money coming in. That has long since gone by the way. Tourists are killed and terrorized.  I long for the day when my wife and I can go back to where we honeymooned in Mexico, back to where we celebrated anniversaries. It was wonderful. We don't believe we can do that now.  If we secure our border and dry up the money to the drug cartels, then the money can begin flowing to Mexico for something besides drugs, and we can cut off the fentanyl and the massive amount of drugs that pours across our southern border undetected.  I know some people say the majority of drugs are coming through the ports of entry. That is where they catch more of it. But as it was explained to me and   Steve Chabot some years back down in Colombia, when they were showing us--we had DEA. The British had people who were helping. They were doing a great job fighting the FARC's drugs down in Colombia under then-President Uribe. They were saying that this guy is fearless. It is hard keeping him alive, but he is amazing. He is fighting the drug cartels down there.  I said, well, so you are saying about two-thirds of the cocaine, the drugs from Colombia, goes up through the Gulf of Mexico into Mexico, so it can cross our southern border. Another one-third apparently goes up to California, trying to cross the border, it goes into Mexico across our southern border. I mean, if they have boats that will go that far, why not just have them pull up to a Texas or California beach that is deserted?  These Colombian, American, and British drug experts explained that it is because the drug cartels are businesspeople. They have a business model. They have a business plan. They play the odds. They know the odds are many times better to get the drugs into America if they don't go to a port of entry and they don't go to an abandoned beach somewhere. They bring it into Mexico, have it cross the Mexico-U.S. border, and they will get most of their drugs in. So that is their business plan. That is still going on. It was going on during President Bush's administration, probably back to Clinton and the former Bush and even Reagan, to a lesser extent. But it is sure going on in the 21st century.  With all the discussion about there not being a crisis when clearly there has been and is--it is a humanitarian crisis, but it is also a crisis of U.S. sovereignty.  We cannot have a country that is based on laws if we cannot control our own borders. We will be overwhelmed, as we have been, by more and more people who do not observe the laws, do not think the laws are important. They do not understand. They have not been educated how important it is to enforce the law fairly across the board. They don't know what it is to preserve self-government.  Franklin knew that, Benjamin Franklin, when he said: ``It is a Republic, madam, if you can keep it.'' He knew. He had studied history, as had our Founders. They knew that the Constitution that came together, as Washington referenced, had to have divine providence at work, because no way these guys who started out for 5 weeks doing nothing but yelling at each other could have come up with a document that was the best governing document, the best constitution, put together in the history of mankind.  Here is more about the media's hypocrisy, an article from the Washington Examiner, Eddie Scarry. This has a quote: ``We now have an actual humanitarian crisis''--there is that C-word again--``on the border that only underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration system once and for all.'' That was a quote from then-President Barack Obama in the Rose Garden in 2014.  He went on to say--that is, President Obama--``In recent weeks, we've seen a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers.''  That is basically, as the Examiner points out, what President Trump said. He said: ``Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.''  This article says: ``The only difference is how the media are covering it.''  The Washington Post said, 2014--this is The Washington Post's words--``The current crisis on the Southwest border, where authorities have apprehended tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American children since October''--well, there you are. There is that C-word they used then and belittle the word being used now.  Anyway, this is an article from The New York Times from 2014 by Michael Shear and Jeremy Peters. They said, talking about the border crossing into Texas, it is ``an urgent humanitarian situation.''  Their article said, and this is from Senator Marco Rubio: ``Let's remember, this administration''--talking about the Obama administration--``went around for years saying the border has never been more secure than it is now. I think,'' and this is Marco Rubio, ``that's been exposed as a fallacy over the last 3 weeks.'' That is because people were realizing it was a border crisis during the Obama years.  Just the fact that it has gone on for years and years does not diminish the crisis. It actually exacerbates the crisis. When you put the October, November, December, January numbers, record numbers, of people coming in claiming to be family units--why? Because they have heard, if they have minor children, then they will be allowed to stay, and they will be allowed to keep the minor children. It is encouraging a dark market, a criminal market, in children.  Make sure, if you are coming to America, you have a child in your group, because then you claim: Oh, we can't be separated.  As the Director of Border Patrol pointed out this week in testimony under oath, now the huge majority is people coming who are claiming to be family units. Most of them are, but we don't know. That is why it is important to check.  So this is a time of crisis, and you would hope that major media, whether it is alt-left or whatever, would be reporting what is happening in America. It is a humanitarian crisis, as they acknowledged during President Obama's term. It is even more of a humanitarian crisis now that there are so many more minor children who are being brought here.  Once again, for those who bring up the term ``war on women,'' how about the fact that over a third of the young girls, the young women, who are brought to our southern border illegally are being sexual assaulted, raped, normally multiple times along the way? Do people not care what is happening? Wouldn't that be a war on women that some of us want to stop?  The estimate by doctors who have been treating these people say that 17 percent of the young boys coming up and crossing into the U.S. illegally have been sexually molested, assaulted.  Where is the outrage? It ought to be from both sides of the aisle.  These are people whose lives are just being terrorized. When we hear about, ``Oh, well, people are just caring about their families,'' really? You would subject your daughter to being one of the third who is sexually raped numerous times while you want to come into America? You would do that to your daughter?  We ought to be helping Mexico. They are not helping much. They are helping some. But we ought to be shoring up the border. It is the best thing we can do for Mexico, continue to be the most generous country in the world, in the history of the world, in allowing people to come into our country legally.  Keep that going. It is good for America. But stop the drug cartels from controlling our southern border. It ought to be our authorities controlling our border, nobody else.  If that is not enough, here comes what has been called a Green New Deal. Some have accurately called it more of a green socialist manifesto, a green raw deal.  Rick Manning has a great article this month: ``Everyone is talking about the Green New Deal and how it would end domestic airline travel, the internal combustion engine, fossil fuel usage, most electricity generation, and even ban cow flatulence. You have groups guessing what the cost of the Green New Deal would be in terms of dollars on an annual basis. . . . To everyone seeking to normalize this Green New Deal, please just shut up.  ``The Green New Deal is the baring of teeth by the new American communist, a new breed unleashed that we have seen in the streets, attacking people attending Trump rallies, screaming at teenagers wearing Make America Great Again hats, shouting down and rioting against conservative speakers on college campuses.  ``Here is the truth. Socialism and communism are evil. Putting a shroud of legitimacy and normalcy to the destruction of the American ideal is being a Menshevik in a Bolshevik revolution. You cannot moderate the bloodlust of those who seek to enslave you by trying to come up with common ground or discuss alternatives to meet their needs. The revolution demands immediate payment.  ``So let's stop talking about the symptoms which the Green New Deal represents and actually begin to dissect the disease that is collectivism. First, definitionally, the only difference between socialism and communism is if you voluntarily surrender your freedom and wealth or have it confiscated. Either alternative ultimately comes from the coercive power of the gun and are based upon the premise that those who have attained wealth used ill-gotten means to get it. As a result, they have no moral authority to keep it from those from whom it presumably was stolen.  ``In socialism and communism, individual rights are not derived from God and guaranteed by the Constitution. Instead, everything you have and can expect comes from the goodwill of the government. It is no mistake that John Lennon's socialist anthem `Imagine' starts with the following words: `Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try. No hell below us; above us, only sky. Imagine all the people living for today.'  ``In order to achieve a kingdom ruled by man, unfettered by morality or rules, you have to nix a sovereign God from the equation. If there is no God, then all rights are nothing more than those that the government chooses to allow you to have, and the only protections that exist are those which they grant. The only question is who gets to be the one holding the keys over everyone else's life.''  This is what, on one hand, surprises me about billionaires in America funding a move toward socialism. Obviously, these are not stupid people. They can look at the history of socialism, communism. They know that, whether it is socialists or communists, you have two classes. You eliminate the middle class. There is no middle class. You have this small group of ruling class, and then you have everybody else, all the miserables.  I guess they think they get us to socialism and they will be part of that elite socialist class that rules over everybody else.  I have seen it. The summer I lived in the Soviet Union, when it was the real Soviet Union, there were some nice things, but it was clear they didn't have freedom. The government watched, through spies, everything that those people did.  I asked, on one occasion: Why is that lady running off?  Well, she is going to go report me, he said.  Why would she go report you? You are not anything to her.  No. In your country you can get ahead by making money. In my country, he said, we get ahead by stepping on others. So anybody you can turn in for anything, anybody that you can step on, it elevates you in our system here in the Soviet Union.  He was right. And that is where we are headed with people thinking socialism is a good way to go.  The bumper sticker is true. The big problem with socialism is you can vote your way into it, but you will have to shoot your way out.  That is what we are seeing play out in Venezuela. They voted themselves into it, and now they are having to shoot their way out. Unfortunately for most of them, they don't have guns, so they are pretty empty-handed in fighting a government that has the guns. It is a tragic situation. It should be one of the most prosperous countries in the world. It was until socialism took over. And again, as Rick Manning is trying to point out, that is where we are headed.  ``It makes one wonder if Ono,'' he said, ``has given up 100 percent of her songwriter royalties to the song to the government as a show of solidarity for the dream.  ``And here is what they don't say,'' he says, ``in order for the world to `live as one' with no possessions, someone is going to have to take all the stuff and hold it collectively for the common good.  ``In order for there to be stuff to take and most importantly eat in the future, someone is going to have to do the hard work to produce it. Someone is going to have to figure out how to produce it, and someone is going to have to get it from where it is produced to where the brotherhood is living. And then someone is going to have to distribute it, being certain that everyone gets the same amount of gruel.''  And I saw that, too, in the stores back in the Soviet Union. If you were part of that elite ruling class, they would keep back a really nice pair of shoes, maybe the only pair they got, for the highest ranking person that they dealt with.  In the stores, the Soviets would tell me: We never find toilet paper; they hold it in the back for the ruling class. We never find good, fresh vegetables. They hold that back for the ruling class.  It is really tragic the way people are treated, ultimately, in a socialist or communist society, or now called progressivist.  So, good article by Brad Polumbo, February 26, How Socialism Destroys Private Charity and Hurts the Poor. It is tragic.  Between what we see destroying the rule of law in America, coming across our southern border illegally, overwhelming our schools--how fair is it? If you really care about children, how fair is it to this big group of children in school?  And as teachers have pointed out to me: I love my kids. I love the kids that come in and don't speak English. But they throw them into a class of English speakers because we are required to educate them, and we have to stop teaching, basically, the English-speaking citizens and residents and go to teaching the new kids that just got thrown in, no fault of their own. But those that suffer are the kids.  They have dreams, but, unfortunately for them, they were either born here or came here legally and speak English. But their dreams are going to be put on hold. They are not going to be able to be educated as well because we have not secured our southern border. And children who don't speak the same language are thrown into their classes, and they are harming the dreams and the hopes of the children who were here.  So is the solution to welcome in 30 million or so people from Mexico? No. It would overwhelm this country, and there would be no place for people to flee to when they are trying to find real asylum from danger.  The better thing is just enforce the law. Secure the border. Cut off the flow of money to the drug cartels, and allow people to live freely here, without worrying about extra crime that wouldn't be here if people weren't here illegally.  It is about preserving the Republic that the Founders gave us. It is about acknowledging that we have, as a nation, been more blessed than any nation in the history of the world. Solomon's Israel didn't have the individual opportunities, the individual assets, the freedoms that we have.  When a majority of Americans fail to recognize that we have been blessed by God and His protective hand has secured our Nation, then those blessings and that protective hand will disappear; and we will be the once-great Camelot, where people could live free, and they could work and keep what they grew, built, earned, that once-great country where people were treated the same, whether poor or rich. They were treated the same under the law.  That once-great country. Wow, what a dream. How did it go wrong?  Well, we just talked about it, and it is time we did something together to stop it.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Madam Speaker, this week was, for all intents and purposes, D.C. Statehood Week in the Capital. I am pleased that, today, Senator Carper has announced that he is introducing the Washington, D.C. Admission Act to make the District of Columbia the 51st State. I am grateful to Senator Carper, who garnered a record number of Senate cosponsors last year and has been a most vigorous champion of statehood for the District of Columbia.  I come to the floor for my first time this session to discuss D.C. statehood because we have many new Members who may be under the mistaken impression that the 700,000 people who live in your Nation's Capital are treated in the same rights that your own residents are. I beg to differ.  In this city, the citizens do not have each and every right in this Congress. To be sure, we have what is called home rule, and I will later indicate that even that is limited.  The reasons for this unique place, for our Capital, left without the full rights of other citizens, has to do with a quirk, an accident, where the Framers came to believe that the Capital should not be part of a State because they were, in the beginning, parts of various States, and they felt that they could not then control what the Capital would do.  Well, of course, they don't want a Capital to be part of a State, but they didn't really envision statehood, the Capital as a State, because they were thinking of the Thirteen Colonies. And since every city had to be in a State, they could only envision putting the city in a State.  We are about 218 years beyond that, and it is time, way past time--shall I say, overdue in time--to understand how the Nation's Capital of the greatest nation in the world should be viewed and what rights its citizens should have.  So I am very grateful to Senator Carper for the work he has done and for his introduction of the bill in the Senate this week, the counterpart of the D.C. statehood bill, which I have already introduced in the House.  The bill I have introduced already has 198 cosponsors. I bet--I haven't looked closely, but there is probably no bill in the hopper that has more cosponsors than the D.C. statehood bill. It is not bipartisan yet. That will happen, because this is how we make progress on matters in the House of Representatives. We go one House at a time.  Remember, the District doesn't have any representation in the Senate; yet we have gotten a distinguished Senator introducing the statehood bill, and he has been most energetic, getting the majority of the Democratic Senators on the bill last session.  I am particularly moved today because of the record number of D.C. residents and their colleagues who came to the Congress yesterday to demand that they have equal rights with all other American citizens. I greeted a room full of residents who had visited every office to tell Members what they don't know.  I am grateful particularly that the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, has strongly endorsed D.C. statehood. I believe that means that D.C. statehood will be on the floor this session. I want to thank our Speaker for making D.C. statehood a priority, and indicating in her own words how important it is that every citizen be treated equally.  In the same way, Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings has committed to holding a hearing on D.C. statehood, and I will predict this afternoon on the floor that that bill will get out of committee and come to the floor of the House for a vote. The progress we are making on D.C. statehood is also seen in the inclusion of our statehood demands in what is called H.R. 1. That is an all-democracy bill that tries to improve and make sure that full democracy in every form is present in the United States. In H.R. 1 are extensive findings for D.C. statehood.  I thank the Democratic majority for including the District of Columbia and its plea for statehood in this all important pro-democracy bill. It is called the For the People Act, and H.R. 1 was the first bill introduced.  Most Members who come to the Congress come knowing only that the Nation's Capital is where all these wonderful memorial buildings are. They know that it is a tourist mecca. Many may have come as children or even as adults, as tourists. They probably don't know that 30 million visitors from all over the world visit our Nation's Capital.  In other words, most Members of the House who, by the way, will spend more time in the District of Columbia than they will spend at home, still don't know very much about their own Capital City. They probably don't know that only in America does the legislature not grant full representation to their Capital City.  Well, I have just voted on the House floor. I vote on amendments, but I did not vote on the final bill. I do vote in what is called the Committee of the Whole. The reason I am able to vote there is that, when I first came to Congress in 1991, I saw that I could, indeed, vote in committee, and I knew there was something called the Committee of the Whole.  Well, what is the difference between voting in committee, like the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for example, where I have always served and voted, what is the difference between that and the Committee of the Whole? No difference. Both are committees that were created by the Congress, not the Constitution.  So, since I vote in committee, I asked for the right to vote in the Committee of the Whole. It was granted.  But only in America, again, could the following happen: my Republican friends sued the House for allowing the vote in the Committee of the Whole.  The courts looked at that, pronounced the right of the Congress to give that vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as the District has the vote in committee, and my Republican friends then appealed.  At the Court of Appeals, the verdict was, yes, the District of Columbia can vote in the Committee of the Whole, just as they vote in committee.  And my good Republican friends didn't quite have the nerve to appeal that one to the Supreme Court, but what they did do, when Democrats lost the House 2 years later, was to take away a vote, that the courts had said was legitimate, from the residents of the District of Columbia, who are number one per capita in taxes paid to support the government of the United States. And therein lies the outrageous anomaly.  Those who pay the most taxes per capita have the least rights. That is why we are determined to get our rights.  Yes, I have just voted on two gun safety amendments that were on this floor today. I couldn't vote on the final bill, but I could vote on those amendments. They were important amendments relating to background checks.  By the way, something like 97 percent of the American people in one poll were shown to favor background checks. That means you check to see if a person has a criminal background and shouldn't have a gun. What is the controversy in that one?  So I was able to vote on those two amendments.  This is all by way of self-help, thinking through what is it I can do to make sure the people I represent have the maximum of representation they can. I sure am not crying about what I cannot do, when you consider what I can do.  I am chair of the most important subcommittee now in the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Through that committee, I have been able to rebuild whole parts of the District of Columbia: The Wharf, the Southwest Waterfront as it is called; the southeast waterfront, Capitol Riverfront; parts of Washington, like NoMa.  I have been able to do a great deal. That is not the issue.  The issue is equal. Not equal for me personally; equal for those I represent, who have paid their dues without getting their rights.  When I say, ``pay their dues,'' I want to elaborate on that. The city I represent has one of the strongest economies in the Nation. It has a budget of about $14 billion. That is larger than the budget of 12 States. Many States are crying poor, trying to tax or not tax their residents, embroiled in that controversy.  The city I represent has a $2 billion surplus. Its per capita income, the per capita income of the Americans who live in your Capital City, is higher than that of any State.  Now, we are about the equivalent in size of seven states. Our per capita income, though, is higher than that of any State. Take your biggest States, Texas and New York and California: higher per capita income. That tells you about how much economic activity there is in your Nation's capital.  This city, which is something of a city state, has residents whose personal income is higher than that of seven States; we do not cry poor.  Our population growth is among the highest in the Nation. People want to live in your Nation's capital. It is one of the most pleasant, livable cities in our country.  What do they pay per capita in taxes? $12,000 per resident in taxes to support a government that does not give them equal rights.  Our Armed Forces--Armed Forces with representatives from every State, it should be known--has always had residents of the District of Columbia who fought and died in every war, including the war that created the United States, the Revolutionary War. You, of course, are aware of that war, the war that was fought for taxation without representation. No wonder District residents are demanding that our Congress live up to that great slogan and standard.  Now, as I indicated, it is not as if we don't have any rights. The Congress passed the Home Rule Act in 1974--I will speak later about the deficiencies of the Home Rule Act--but that means that the city does have its own elected mayor and its own elected legislature, its council.  How did we get that? Well, first of all, it took over 100 years after the Civil War. The first home rule was given to the Capital City by Republicans in the 19th century who had fought and won the Civil War, where those in my party the Democrats had fought on the side of slavery.  Republicans fought on the side of freedom, and when it saw it had a capital that did not have freedom, it gave the District home rule.  Now, the Republicans had rather much lost their way, as the Democrats certainly had, for more than 100 years, but when Richard Nixon was President of the United States, the Home Rule Act was passed.  I would just like to read a few of his words. He said, in signing the bill: ``As a longtime supporter of self-government for the District of Columbia, I am pleased to sign into law a measure which is of historic significance for the citizens of our Nation's Capital.''  He went on to say: ``I,'' that is Richard Nixon, now, ``first voted for home rule as a Member of the House of Representatives in 1948, and I have endorsed the enactment of home rule legislation during both my terms as President.''  This was bipartisan, finally. And Republicans, that party, that post-war party, post-World War II party, deserves credit for understanding that the time had come for the Capital City to have home rule.  That home rule was not complete, in the sense that, and most importantly, the District budget has to come here, and it becomes a foil on which to press amendments to overturn laws that people may not like.  I have been able to defeat most of those riders, as we call them, or attempts to take down D.C. laws, but the D.C. budget shouldn't come here at all.  I recognized that while pursuing statehood, I could get close to statehood by simply finishing the Home Rule Act and making it whole and complete, and so I embarked on a two-track road. One, of course, is the one I have just discussed: D.C. statehood.  The other is what I call free and equal D.C. bills, bills that together bring us close to statehood. I started with a congressional review amendment. This one is really nonsensical.  The District passes a law. Ultimately, most of those laws matter not to the Congress and certainly aren't overturned, but the Home Rule Act says that the law shall not become final for 30 days, and that is 30 consecutive days.  The House is not in session consecutive days. This is Thursday, for example. We are out, so I don't know if it is 3 or 4 days this week that would be counted, but you have to count up till you get to 30 days, and then, of course, the bill can become law.  Well, it always does. No one uses this particular power at all. If they want to overturn D.C. laws, then they simply try to attach it to appropriations as they come.  So this is completely unused, but it is terribly burdensome on the city, because you simply have to keep renewing these bills that have been passed in the District until you get finally through the 30-day period. It is ridiculous: not used by the Congress, burdensome on the city, should and could be gotten rid of without anyone noticing it in the Congress or caring about it. So I began with that one, which the Congress can't possibly care about, because it doesn't even use it ever.  But look at some of the other things that could be done even without statehood, which is leading me to embark on this two-track system.  For example, the District of Columbia does not have a local prosecutor, like a district attorney, for example, or a state's attorney.  The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, a Federal official, not chosen by the District of Columbia, but by the President of the United States, is essentially the district attorney for the District of Columbia. We have no say in this.  And that U.S. attorney has a jurisdiction that has nothing to do with what U.S. attorneys do in other States. It is local law. 90 percent of what the U.S. attorney has as jurisdiction is local law, like the law a DA would enforce. About 10, sometimes 15 percent of his work is Federal.  We want to send him back to all of his Federal work, give him time to do all of that so that we would have a local prosecutor.  That is one of the bills that this Congress could pass, House and Senate, and hardly think about it, because it is certainly uncontroversial that the city have its own law enforcement officer to enforce its criminal laws.  And there is a National Guard rule act. Now, that is the equivalent of what I am speaking of when I say that the Congress should have no interest, only the District.  The National Guard cannot be called out in the event, for example, of a hurricane or a huge snowfall or a flood, only the President of the United States can. The President of the United States does not need to be bothered with tasks related to ordinary emergencies in the District of Columbia. Somehow, the Mayor would have to find the President and say: Please call out the National Guard. That is the local National Guard.  We don't want jurisdiction over the National Guard when it comes to national matters. We want the same jurisdiction that the States have. The States have the right to call out the National Guard to protect their residents when there are natural disasters. That is, essentially, what we are asking for. So that, too, is part of my Free and Equal D.C. series.  Again, there are 20 of these bills. Let me just indicate one other: the District of Columbia Home Rule Clemency Act. I investigated how often clemency is allowed or has been afforded, and I found only one instance. I will tell you why.  The President of the United States alone can offer clemency to someone who has broken local law. Do you think he bothers or, for that matter, should bother? That is why they don't post anyone who gets clemency in the District of Columbia.  These are the kind of local matters that are holdovers, absolute holdovers, from the days when the District had no home rule. We can't possibly hold our heads up as a democracy and have matters like this that cannot be attended at the local level.  Occasionally, someone comes forward with the notion: We understand, Congressman. We want to make sure that the residents of the Nation's Capital have the same rights as other places. Here is what we would like to do. You come out of a portion of land, contributed by the State of Maryland, so why not return the District of Columbia to Maryland, then you would get your full and equal rights?  Well, the first thing you ought to do is ask Maryland about that. Then you might ask the District of Columbia. And here I have the answers, I think.  Statehood is endorsed by 86 percent of D.C. residents. Retrocession, as it is called, has no constituency either in Maryland or in the District.  This is how I know that.  There was a poll taken in Maryland asking whether or not they thought the District of Columbia should be returned to Maryland. Now, understand, Maryland is a very progressive jurisdiction, but it only has one big city. That is the city of Baltimore. It apparently is not welcoming of another city which has formed its own identity as a State and, for that reason, has an identity as a big city.  I am not surprised that a poll of Maryland legislators found that 92 percent of Maryland Senators oppose retrocession of the District to Maryland, and 82 percent of Maryland Delegates--that is their lower house--oppose retrocession.  What I think this points up is that there are no easy answers: taking a city that is almost as old as the Nation itself--the District became the Capital City in 1801--and somehow finding some easy answer, which turns out to be even harder. It is hard enough to get the Congress to recognize statehood.  Now, suppose we have to go to Maryland, in the case of retrocession, and D.C. to get that answer. That is a harder road to climb. It is not democratic, because that is not what Maryland wants and that is not what the District of Columbia wants. It is a very mechanical answer to a very deep problem.  I indicated that I just voted in the Congress in the Committee of the Whole, and I have voted now, in this new Congress, which is about 8 weeks old, two or three times. Each of those votes are of such great significance to the people I represent. It encourages them to believe that they will have a vote not only in the Committee of the Whole, but they will have a vote where every other American has a vote.  For them, I can only say that they have overpaid, in every conceivable way, for equal rights--yes, by fighting and dying in every war and, yes, in Federal taxes paid, per capita, a larger amount than any residents.  For me, of course, this is a labor of love because I was born and raised here. I am the daughter of a runaway slave who ran away from Virginia.  It is interesting that he ran away and found himself and settled in the District of Columbia as an illegal immigrant, I suppose--a runaway slave--but there was work here. He found work in the city and began to raise work helping to build the city because they were building the roads of the city at that time in the 1830s.  It was no part of his vision that the District would ever have the same rights as other Americans, certainly no part of his vision, as then still a slave, that he would have anything to do with it.  So, this afternoon, as I think about my city and strive for its equality, I think of my great-grandfather, Richard Holmes, who sought freedom for himself and his family the only way he could: by simply walking off of a plantation and making his way to the District of Columbia. In his name, I am honored to seek more of that freedom and equality for the 700,000 Americans who now live in our Nation's Capital.  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. President, as recently as a few days ago, our government funding discussions seemed to be in a pretty good place. Bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on finishing out the year's appropriations process seemed to be right on track. We appeared headed toward a compromise result that would have provided much needed investments in border security and completed our remaining appropriations bill to fully fund the government.  Last week, the Democratic leader seemed confident that ``we worked out a plan to refund the government, deal with border security in a way that would be acceptable to all sides. That's working pretty well.'' Just this past Friday, the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Leahy, suggested that ``we're 95 to 98 percent done.''  But then over the weekend, we heard that the talks had suddenly hit a snag. The bipartisan momentum had stalled. What went wrong? Here is what happened. The House Democrats decided to add a poison pill demand into the conversations at the eleventh hour. It is a new demand. It is really extreme--a hard, statutory cap on the number of illegal immigrants who could be detained by the Federal Government. This would result in the release of thousands of criminal aliens and our inability to detain thousands more criminal aliens whom our Federal and State law enforcement authorities will apprehend.  This is a poison pill that no administration--not this one, not the previous one--would or should ever accept. Imagine the absurdity of this. House Democrats want to set a limit on how many criminal aliens our government can detain. This is a limit that is not based on any aspect of reality, such as how many criminal aliens there actually are or what crimes they have committed; it is just an arbitrary number a couple of lawmakers have pulled out of thin air. The consequence of such an arbitrary limit is obvious: Thousands of criminal aliens would simply be released into the interior of our country, both immediately and then on a rolling basis into the future.  The National Sheriffs' Association explained this in a letter to Chairman Shelby and Senator Leahy. Here is what the sheriffs had to say:       Capping the number of detention beds . . . not only      jeopardizes the integrity of the immigration system, but      would cripple ICE's ability to detain criminal aliens and      other aliens who pose a risk to public safety or are a flight      risk. . . . In order to meet the cap tentatively proposed by      Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of      aliens from custody.  That is what the National Sheriffs' Association had to say about it--released, just like that, right out into the United States of America. It is hard to believe this is where some Democrats are--a get-out-of-jail-free card for criminals because the radical left doesn't like U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Let me say that again. It is a get-out-of-jail-free card for criminals because the radical left doesn't like U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.  It is hard to believe the ``Abolish ICE'' fringe among House Democrats actually thinks enforcing our laws is wrong. It is hard to believe a group of House Democrats see kneecapping American law enforcement as a higher priority than keeping the government open. But it would be even harder to believe that leading Democrats would be open to this craziness and would let this last-minute poison pill scuttle the entire appropriations process.  Just last year, when the Democratic leader was highlighting productive, bipartisan work on this appropriations process, he said: ``Both sides have worked to avoid poison pill riders. That has meant steady progress.'' Ranking Member Leahy celebrated that through last year's committee process, ``We avoided new poison pill riders.'' So I hope my Democratic colleagues are able to talk some sense into their side.  Some House Democrats are risking a second partial government shutdown by calling for this absurd, last-minute poison pill. No administration of any party would sign a bill that forced them to release criminal aliens into the interior of the United States. No administration would accept this poison pill forcing the release of criminals now and on a rolling basis going forward.  I understand that the four leaders on Appropriations in both Chambers will be meeting in just a few minutes. I would implore my friends across the aisle: Untangle yourselves from the most extreme far-left voices out on the fringe. Do not let this radical fringe and its absurd demand prevent you from taking yes for an answer. Don't let them torpedo all of this bipartisan work.  This provision would, rightly, be a total nonstarter with the White House--with any White House, not just this one. It would erase our progress and kick us back to square one. It is a total poison pill, pure and simple.  The American people are not clamoring for more aliens with criminal backgrounds to be roaming at large in their communities. I never heard anybody ask for that. And they certainly are not so eager for that outcome that they want another partial shutdown in order to achieve it.  My Democratic colleagues in this Chamber need to see this stunt for what it is, bring their side back to the table, and finish our work for the American people."

                "speech":"Mr. President, Chairman Murkowski and I have been working with the majority leader and minority leader to resolve the few remaining issues on our bill, which is the land management bill we have before us.  I would like to thank all Senators for their cooperation and for the work they have put in to get this to this point. I believe we are making good progress.  We will vote on the motion to invoke cloture at 5:30. I will be joining Chairman Murkowski in voting yes on cloture, and I encourage all of my colleagues to do the same.  I understand that Senator Lee, my dear friend from Utah, may want a vote on his amendment to exempt Utah from the Antiquities Act. I have talked to Senator Lee many times about his concerns with national monuments in his State. While I respect his views, I will oppose any amendment that threatens the success of this lands bill. At this point, any amendment would threaten the success of the bill.  This bill is truly a great piece of legislation for our country. This package includes numerous important provisions that will enhance conservation, recreation, and hunting, fishing, and shooting opportunities for sportsmen on Federal lands.  In my view, one of the most important provisions in the bill is the permanent--I repeat, the permanent--reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. I have long supported the permanent reauthorization of the LWCF, which has played a crucial role in making my State all the more wild and wonderful. In fact, since 1965, $243 million of LWCF funds have been spent to enhance recreation and conservation in West Virginia alone.  LWCF funds have been used to provide public access and protect many of West Virginia's most popular recreation sites, including the Dolly Sods Wilderness in the Monongahela National Forest, as well as every access point on the Lower Gauley River in the Gauley River National Recreation Area. As you can see on this chart, LWCF funds have protected 57,000 acres in the Gauley River and the New River Gorge.  While LWCF funds are used to protect important Federal conservation and recreation lands, the program also provides essential funding to States to enhance State and local park and outdoor recreational opportunities. These are not free giveaways to States but, rather, they are matching grants that result in increased recreational opportunities at the State and local levels.  This is Ritter Park in Huntington, WV. Ritter Park offers miles of walking trails along an area called Fourpole Creek. Ritter Park also has numerous tennis courts, playground facilities, and an amphitheater that is used by the community for small events, such as concerts and plays. The rose garden, which you can see here, is a wonderful place to spend some time, and in 2012, Ritter Park was named as one of the ``Great Public Spaces'' by the American Planning Association. Over the years, more than $625,000 in State Land and Water Conservation funds has been spent on improvements at Ritter Park.  The Land and Water Conservation Fund also provides other important financial assistance to States, including funding for the Forest Legacy Program, which helps to protect working forests on private lands; the American Battlefield Protection Program, which helps to protect Civil War and Revolutionary War battlefield sites on State and private lands; and grants to protect endangered species' habitats on non-Federal lands.  On the Federal side, LWCF funds have been used to safeguard some of our Nation's iconic public lands. Here you can see just a few examples of areas where LWCF funds have been used to ensure that we can set aside these areas for future generations and help our land management Agencies follow their conservation missions as directed by Congress.  LWCF funds help to complete the protection of and provide important public access to areas set aside by Congress in recognition of their national significance, including lands managed by the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the Forest Service.  In West Virginia, we have the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge, which is managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Canaan was established in 1994 and was the 500th wildlife refuge to be established. Since 1994, every single acre of the 16,613-acre area was acquired using LWCF funds. As one can see here, the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge is a truly beautiful place that would not have been possible had we not had the LWCF. Permanent reauthorization of the LWCF will ensure States and Federal land management Agencies will continue to protect and conserve nationally significant lands for future generations--all without relying on taxpayer dollars. It is past time for Congress to permanently reauthorize the LWCF.  The Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the many pieces of legislation in this package. It is another reason we need to pass this bill without amendments and send it over to the House and then to the President for his signature. I am pleased that we are making good progress, and I hope we will be able to move to its final passage without additional delays.  I thank the Presiding Officer.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

We have been working on this bill with not only Senator Cantwell and Senator Manchin but with the chairman and ranking member of the House Natural Resources Committee. We did that last fall when the composition of that committee on the House side was a little bit different and now in this new year. We have been working forward with the commitment from our respective leaderships to bring this measure to the floor early in this Congress, and here we are.

I make mention of the contributions of a few Members on our side and a few Members on the Democratic side who have really been engaged with us throughout this process--Senator Gardner, Senator Daines, Senator Wyden, Senator Heinrich--and of the dozens of Members who are on this measure as cosponsors. We truly appreciate it.  We made some good progress last week. We reached agreement to enter into debate on our bill. We considered two amendments. Both of those amendments were tabled in order to preserve what we would refer to as the spirit of the bicameral-bipartisan agreement. We anticipate one more amendment to process today before we move to a cloture vote. I am pleased that we are at this point as we near the end of the floor debate on this measure, and I would like to spend just a few moments this afternoon, if I may, speaking to the really extensive process that has gone into this bill.  It is a substantive bill. There is no doubt about it. It is substantive because of the many, many different, discrete, small provisions that have been incorporated into it. Reaching this point has been no small task. I mentioned last week the way that we handle many of these lands matters before the U.S. Senate. It is an imperfect process--that is certainly for sure--but so many of these issues are so parochial that they just do not command the floor time that is available here. Invariably, what we effort to do is to put together a package of these measures. We really haven't seen a lands package before the Congress that has been ready to move out or, actually, be signed into law--that is, I guess, the best way to say it--since 2014. So that is 5 years of really pent-up demand, if you will, to address these matters.  So over the course of several years and multiple Congresses, both the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee have held dozens of hearings and business meetings to prepare the more than 100 bills we have now incorporated into S. 47. So when you think about, again, the process that goes into it--this is endless hours, countless hours of Member time, of staff time that go into these meetings as we work on very local priorities and then drafting the legislative text and refining it to make it right and refining it yet again to make it right.  We have also worked for months on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to truly negotiate every word in this bill, literally down to one-tenth of a mile for a certain designation on a specific conveyance there, so really taking a very sharp eye and a sharp pencil to all of the provisions that are in here.  We have really worked to try to incorporate as many local, State, and Member priorities as possible. The process these matters went through in order to get where we are today--the regular order process in the House, in the Senate, and in many cases, in both--is really quite impressive. I mentioned some of the Member priorities last week. Members have come to the floor. I indicated that we have included provisions sponsored by at least 50 different Senators within this bill. That number rises to about 90 Senators when we count the cosponsorship of various Members. So, again, it was very collaborative in terms of how we reached out to everyone to ensure their priorities are heard.  We have heard a lot on the floor about the contributions contained within the sportsmen's provision--something I have worked on with Members over the course of years, with different partners on the other side, whether it was Senator Tester or Senator Heinrich. It has been three Congresses running that we have tried to advance a bipartisan sportsmen's bill. So there are so many who are looking with great interest into finally passing these sportsmen's provisions.  There is a provision in here that helps the folks in Tennessee. One of Senator Alexander's priority projects is a special resource study for the James K. Polk Presidential home in Columbia, TN. It was built in 1916. It is the only surviving private residence of our 11th President. What we do within this bill is we take that first step to make a determination, to ask the question of whether this special place should be designated as a national park unit at some point in the future. So pretty parochial, pretty small, but it is important to those in Columbia, TN.  I mentioned some of the Arizona provisions. Udall Park in Tucson, AZ, is a priority for the Arizona delegation. This is one of those issues where they have a pretty popular local community park in the city, and there are all kinds of activities one would anticipate taking place in a small park--baseball, swimming, farmers market. Up until just a couple years ago, the city of Tucson was actually unaware that the Federal Government even owned this local park. So what we do in this bill is we clean up the ownership issue, which allows the city to move forward with the day-to-day activities without facing these Federal bureaucratic hurdles that happen back here. So when they want to do something that would be good for that community, such as expanding a farmers market or improving cell service on the softball fields, they don't have to come to us to ask for permission--pretty common sense.  I mentioned some of the priorities coming out of the State of Louisiana and a measure that Senator Cassidy has been working on, the Lake Bistineau Land Title Stability Act. I shared the story of some homeowners who had been on a parcel for 13 years, built their home, wanted to sell, and then they found out they couldn't because they didn't have clear title to their land due to an issue with the BLM management survey. So we worked with BLM and the State of Louisiana--all this bipartisan work--to clear up the title. Again, this is something that you wouldn't think you would need an act of Congress to do, but we do that.  Up in the State of Minnesota, we worked with their delegation to modify the boundaries of the Voyageurs National Park.  In Georgia, we are expanding the Ocmulgee National Monument--this is a prehistoric American Indian site--and we are doing this at the request of the local communities and the Tribes. It has strong support from the Creek Indian Tribe and the local community. It is a designation that will help preserve the historic and cultural values of the area as well provide economic benefit by giving greater opportunities for visitors.  So these are some of the various priorities we have included in this very comprehensive package. These are not things that are going to make the front page of the Washington Post or the New York Times. These are very local. But I can pretty much guarantee that they will be on the front page of the Ocmulgee--I still don't know if I am pronouncing that correctly--within the Creek Indian Tribe. They are going to make sure people know that this is something we have been working on for a long period of time and that it has finally been addressed in Congress.  Working over the years to help address these priorities is very, very important. We have received the support of not only so many colleagues in the Senate and in the House, Republicans and Democrats, but we have heard it from organizations and communities around the country. Some of these names are pretty well known to us: Ducks Unlimited, the Boone and Crockett Club, Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation, the National Wildlife Federation, the U.S. Travel Association, the Nature Conservancy.  That is just a few of the many that have weighed in. I want to give a couple more examples of groups that have written in to share their support.  The Southeast Tourism Society wrote that ``S. 47 has earned the enthusiastic support of the travel and tourism industry.''  I mentioned last week that so many of the provisions contained in this bill really help these little local economies or the broader economies within the region, so you can see where the travel and tourism industry would be appreciative.  The Outdoor Recreation Roundtable--this is a consortium made up of a number of recreation associations--wrote that our bill should be passed to ``guarantee American's great outdoors receive the attention and resources they so richly deserve and to ensure the outdoor recreation economy continues to grow.''  We are also hearing from communities that have been waiting for congressional action to resolve longstanding Federal land management issues. I mentioned the one in Louisiana. I also mentioned the situation in Tucson, AZ. We did receive a letter from the mayor of Tucson in support of our package because of the provision we have included that he says ``will bring closure to a historic agreement made between the city of Tucson and Bureau of Land Management at a popular urban park in Tucson's northeast business and residential areas.'' That mayor knows this is going to allow the local community to do some of the more simple tasks, such as operating a farmers market, without going through these bureaucratic hoops and hurdles.  Another provision in the bill will convey a parcel of land on the shores of Lake Fannin to Fannin County in Texas. The county commissioner shared that with the conveyance of this land, they will be able to ``continue the process to restore, preserve, and protect the historical significance and beauty this lake has to offer for years to come.''  So, again, there is the encouragement we are getting from the communities and from the organizations. I have certainly heard from a lot of Alaskans who are very pleased about where we are with this lands package.  We heard from Sheri Buretta. Sheri is the chair of Chugach Alaska Corporation, and she wrote that ``Section 1113 of S. 47, while long overdue from our perspective, provides a welcome and extremely helpful mechanism for addressing serious inequities relative to our land settlement.''  Again, the land settlement in Alaska is decades old, and we are still attempting to address some of those inequities, and this legislation allows us to do that.  David Fee, who is the coordinating scientist at the Alaska Volcano Observatory, noted that ``current volcano monitoring capacity in the United States is deficient, and we are unable to accurately forecast and detect eruptions at an adequate level. . . . Passing and funding [this measure will provide] for a safer and more resilient United States.''  The benefits we provide for so many around the country--these are just a few of the examples of the many communities and organizations that support the passage of the bill. We have a full list of our supporters that is available on the committee's website--it runs almost 7 pages long--that I am going to be submitting for the record--not only that consolidated list but also the many, many letters of support we have received. These folks--these individuals, these groups, these communities--are writing in to make their support known because there is good policy in this package. It is policy that fosters economic development in rural America. It is policy that ensures that incredible landscapes are conserved for future generations to enjoy. It is policy that ensures access for sports men and women. It also allows for greater access for some of our off-highway vehicles. It is policy that enhances our volcano-monitoring systems. It empowers local water managers to make decisions on how to conserve water and endangered species.  I want to just kind of segue off of that because there hasn't been a lot of discussion about the water provisions within this bill. I keep referring to S. 47 as the lands package, but the truth is, it is not just about land; it is about water as well, and it includes a number of important western water provisions.  We improve water management by taking important steps to provide greater local control over water resources and promote management that balances the needs of water users with fish and wildlife protection. As an example of this, we create a new Bureau of Reclamation title transfer program. This is going to facilitate conveyance of water facilities to the local agencies that have been managing them for decades and in some cases longer than decades--almost over a century--and that have fully repaid the government for the cost. So effectively what we are talking about here is we are simplifying the process for local utilities, States, and Tribes to pursue title transfers for reclamation projects, not by requiring an act of Congress to do it. So it is simplification. It is common sense. It is making things work. It is a straightforward change in the law that will make a huge difference for the entities in 17 of our Western States that manage water projects, canals, and other water infrastructure that irrigate more than 11 million acres of land--land that provides fresh fruits and vegetables for millions of Americans every day.  In the bill, we also authorize individual title transfers to California and Oklahoma. These provisions will greatly improve water management and incentivize capital investment in water infrastructure while conserving water resources and protecting public safety.  The reauthorization of the Upper Colorado and the San Juan River fish recovery program and phase 3 of the Yakima Basin Water Enhancement Project are both included in this bill. I think both of these are great examples of how a collaborative approach to water challenges, rather than litigation and conflict, results in solutions that benefit water users and the environment. We have certainly heard from Senator Cantwell on this as it relates to the Yakima Basin project and the very collaborative effort that was involved with that. The Colorado River project involves bringing four species of endangered fish back from the brink of extinction while water development projects move forward.  There are other important water provisions that didn't make it into the bill for various reasons. I think many of us were disappointed, it is fair to say. It is clear to me that there is a lot more that we have to do to address these major challenges with western management of water and drought resilience. We have some issues to work through on that, certainly not the least of which is the Colorado River drought contingency plan. This involves an interstate agreement to keep Lake Mead from dropping to critical levels. It has taken years of negotiation with cities, Tribes, farmers, and elected officials.  I clearly understand that this is a time-sensitive issue. I had hoped we might be able to finalize it for this package, but I am looking forward to working with both Senator McSally, who is the new chairman of the Water and Power Subcommittee of the Energy Committee, and Senator Cortez Masto, who is the ranking member, so we can get this over the finish line as quickly as we can.  We also need to complete our work to reauthorize the Bureau of Reclamation's infrastructure funding programs to better utilize Federal lands and water facilities for aquifer recharge and eliminate duplication in the permitting of reclamation pump storage projects.  We are making good strides on the water side with this measure as well. I think it is important to remind folks that it is a lands package; it addresses many of the issues related to water; it is a sportsmen's package; and it is truly a conservation package as we look to what we have included and incorporated as the permanent authorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund.  This is a good bill we have in front of us. We have been able to make it even a little better through our substitute amendment. I do know that we have many colleagues who, if we had more time, would say that they have more amendments they would like to offer for the package. We are not going to have the time or the ability to come to an agreement to add them here, but it is not without a great deal of work that we have gotten to this place. Again, the fact that we have been working for years--literally, years--to put this together is demonstration of our good faith to try to incorporate as much as we possibly can.  I do want to repeat, and I know Senator Manchin has, as well, that this is not going to be our last chance to pass natural resources legislation in this Congress. As soon as we get done here--hopefully, no later than early tomorrow--we are going to be right back at work. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee is going back to work, holding hearings, moving lands legislation. This is our effort, what we are dealing with right now, to clear the deck, and then move on to some new issues. We will be back again to move many of the provisions that perhaps weren't quite ready for this particular package.  Later this afternoon, we are going to vote on motions to end debate on S. 47. I strongly, strongly encourage all Members to support that motion and to allow us to take final steps to move this important package with good, strong, robust bipartisan support, and send it over to the House of Representatives so that we can finally get this enacted into law.  I see my friend from Nebraska is here.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I offer my thanks and appreciation to the chairman of the committee, Senator Murkowski, and the ranking member, Senator Manchin, for the work they have done on this lands package. They have tried their best to bring to the forefront a number of different viewpoints and, obviously, a wide variety of issues that are included in this package. They have worked hard to meet many demands on all sides, and I thank them for getting that done.  I am going to be installed this week as one of the chairmen of the sportsmen's caucus, and we are thrilled to be able to have the sportsmen's bill included in this package so that we can continue to see this great American tradition of families and friends enjoying the outdoors, hunting, fishing, and recreating in this beautiful land that we have here in the United States of America.  I am very fortunate today to welcome a number of conservationists from Nebraska to Washington, DC. This is a group of bright, young people who are taking part in Nebraska's Leadership Education/Action Development Program, true conservationists who are ag producers, ag business people, and are here visiting us. This is known as the LEAD Program. They are individuals from various backgrounds who participate in this premier agriculture leadership program.  Over the course of 2 years, Nebraska LEAD fellows engage in monthly seminars all across the State; they visit our Nation's Capital; and they even have the opportunity to study agriculture systems overseas. The goal of the LEAD Program is to develop the next generation of innovative thinkers, problem solvers, and decision makers who will work to provide food and fuel to our world.  As a proud LEAD alum myself, I can tell you that it has helped to shape who I am today. This program continues to be near and dear to my heart. Through the LEAD Program, I learned valuable leadership skills that I have carried with me in serving my community in the Nebraska Legislature and right here in the U.S. Senate.  Many may not know this statistic, but by the year 2050, there will be an additional 2 billion people to feed in this world. It is important that the future generations of agricultural leaders are motivated and prepared to deal with unforeseen challenges on the road ahead. The LEAD Program is an extraordinary opportunity for Nebraskans to learn more about international trade, about foreign policy, and the unique agricultural systems that we have in our State, in our country, and in our world. Participants in the program will gain firsthand experience in what it means to be an agricultural leader here at home.  Agriculture is the beating heart of my State's economy. The hard work of our farmers and ranchers in Nebraska produces abundant bounties every year. We feed the world. We are privileged to do this and proud of this responsibility, and we pass it on to the next generation.  We also know that putting food on family dinner tables around the world does not come easy. It is the result of calloused hands and long days. It is chopping ice in the tank for thirsty cattle when it is 20 below, and moving irrigation pipes for thirsty crops when it is 110. It is the product of bright innovations, new technology, critical thinking, and fresh solutions in addressing some of our world's most pressing challenges. Now it is in the hands of the next generation of leaders.  Nebraska's LEAD Class 38 understands this. They know that our future is filled with promise. So I am expecting great things from each and every one of them, and I look forward to meeting with them this afternoon after I leave the floor.  LEAD Class 38, we are grateful for the work that you are doing now and the good work that you will do to help build a stronger Nebraska and a stronger world. I want to again extend a formal, warm welcome to all members of LEAD 38, and I hope you will enjoy your time in our Nation's Capital.  I yield the floor."

                "speech":"Madam President, the second bill that I have introduced is the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act. I have introduced this bill with my friend and colleague from Maryland, Senator Cardin. Our legislation will improve the access that Medicare beneficiaries have to home healthcare by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives to order home health services. All of these healthcare professionals are playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas of our Nation, like those represented by the Presiding Officer and the State of Maine.  I have learned of far too many cases of seniors experiencing unnecessary delays in accessing home healthcare because a physician was not available to order the care promptly. To avoid these needless delays, it is common sense that other medical professionals who are familiar with a patient's case should be able to order these services. Under current law, however, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home healthcare for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient's case as the nonphysician provider. In some cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely on the recommendation of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist, or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home healthcare. That makes no sense whatsoever. In too many cases, these requirements create obstacles, delays, and unnecessary paperwork before home healthcare can be provided. The result can be an unnecessary hospital readmission or other setback for the patient that would not have occurred had the home healthcare been provided promptly.  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act removes the needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home healthcare they need simply because a physician is not available to sign the form required by law. Again, I would make the point that this physician may not even have a relationship with the senior or other patient who needs the home healthcare. That primary care relationship may be between the patient and a nurse practitioner or a physician assistant, and yet that qualified healthcare professional is unable to order the home care that the patient needs.  These two bills will help to ensure the viability and accessibility of home health services now and in the future. By helping patients to avoid much more costly hospital stays and nursing homes, we know that home healthcare saves Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers' programs millions of dollars each year. At a time when healthcare costs are among our most pressing policy challenges, we should embrace cost-effective solutions like home healthcare.  Thank you, Madam President.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, imagine going into a U.S. prison and announcing that a substantial number of the prisoners had to be released immediately--no exceptions, even if the prisoners in question had participated in serious crimes or committed violent offenses. That is an unthinkable scenario, and no one would seriously suggest going into our Nation's prisons and immediately releasing thousands of prisoners, including violent offenders onto the streets. Yet that is exactly what Democrats are proposing as part of a border security agreement.  Over the weekend, Democrats proposed capping the number of illegal immigrants who could be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Incredibly, they are refusing to allow an exception to the cap for violent criminals. Under Democrats' proposal, if Immigration and Customs Enforcement needed to detain more than 16,500 violent criminals in the interior of our country, they simply wouldn't be able to do it. Instead, immigration enforcement officers would have to choose which violent criminals to release back into our communities. Think about that.  Obviously, everyone who has come here illegally has broken our laws, but in a lot of cases in question, we are talking about people who have violated other laws, like laws against assault, rape, murder, theft, drug trafficking, and more. We are talking about limiting law enforcement's ability to make sure that those individuals are detained.  It isn't just about future detentions either. If the Democrats' enforcement cap went into effect, Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be forced to release criminals already in detention onto our Nation's streets.  Additionally, there are an estimated 180,000 criminal illegal aliens in the United States who currently are not in custody.  So, under the Democrats' proposal, not only would Immigration and Customs Enforcement be forced to release violent criminals, for all practical purposes, it would also be prohibited from trying to take additional dangerous criminals off of our streets.  Let's be very clear about what we are talking about here. We are talking about limiting the ability of a law enforcement agency to enforce criminal laws. No administration of either party would accept an arbitrary limit on the number of criminals it would be able to detain. No administration would or should sign off on a law that would force law enforcement agencies to leave violent criminals on our Nation's streets.  As of a couple of days ago, the Republicans, I would say, were encouraged by the bipartisan nature of the negotiations to prevent another government shutdown. Then the Democrats came forward with this absurd proposal to limit law enforcement's ability to detain even dangerous criminals.  Are Democrats trying to derail negotiations with a poison pill at the eleventh hour and force another shutdown? The question has to be asked since no one could seriously think that any President of either party would sign a deal that would limit his administration's ability to enforce the law.  We still have a few days left. I hope the Democrats will abandon this preposterous proposal to release dangerous criminals onto our Nation's streets. We can achieve a deal to avert another shutdown, but we can't do it by jeopardizing law enforcement's ability to protect the American people.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Madam President, a little over a month ago, I stood before this body to object to the massive public lands package that it was poised to pass. This bill, some 680 pages long, was released at 10 a.m. that morning--that very morning when they first wanted us to pass this. My staff and I had not seen it beforehand, and we had been given no time to read it. This is, of course, really bad process--terrible process. This is not the way legislation should be written. It is not the way legislation should be debated. It is, of course, never ever the way legislation should be passed. In addition to the bad process, I objected at the time because I suspected that it also contained bad policy--bad policy that would disproportionately and negatively affect my State of Utah.  Now we find ourselves today, more than a month later, at a moment at which we are considering the bill. During that time period, I have, of course, had time to read the bill. Unfortunately, those suspicions that I had about the bill have since been confirmed. This bill perpetuates a terrible standard for Federal land policy in the West, particularly for the State of Utah.  To give one some background, the Federal Government owns more than 640 million acres of land. This is a staggering amount of real estate--an amount of land that in its totality is larger than the entireties of France, Spain, Germany, Poland, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria, Switzerland, and the Netherlands combined--all of them. I don't mean the national parks of those lands combined. I don't mean the government lands owned by those respective nations. I mean the entirety of those countries combined. That is how much land the Federal Government owns just within the United States. That is a problem, especially because of the way it is distributed.  Do you see this? Federal public land is not distributed evenly across the entire country. It is distributed in such a way that the West bears a disproportionate burden. In fact, my home State of Utah is a place that itself bears a disproportionate burden, a disproportionate share of that land, with two-thirds of the land being owned by the Federal Government. You will see, on this map, we have Federal land marked in red, and land that is not owned by the Federal Government is marked in white. You will see there is a big difference, as you move from west to east, in the amount of Federal land that exists.  I remember when Eliza, my daughter, was about 8 years old. It was the first time I ever showed her this map. As best I could, I explained it to her, an 8-year-old.  At the time, she looked at the map and said: In every State east of Colorado, the Federal Government owns less than 15 percent of the land. In many of those States, it is in the low single digits as a percentage of the total land in a State that is owned by the Federal Government. In Colorado or in every State west of Colorado, the Federal Government owns at least 15 percent of the land, and in many of the States, like mine, it is a lot, lot more than that. This is, of course, an enormous amount of land. Make no mistake--it imposes an enormous burden on my State. In light of this, what are my objections to this bill? Well, there are a few.  First, this bill permanently reauthorizes something called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, or the LWCF, as it is sometimes abbreviated. Passed in 1964 by Congress, the LWCF was enacted to promote and preserve access to recreation opportunities on public land--to promote and preserve access to recreation opportunities. This is an admirable and worthy goal, so the fund was set up to be the principal source of money for new Federal land acquisition and to assist the States in developing recreation opportunities.  As originally conceived and passed by Congress, it directed 60 percent of its funds to be appropriated for State purposes and 40 percent for Federal purposes. Unfortunately, the program has since drifted from its original intent and from its original wording, and it has been a program that has been rife with abuse. I understand that in some States, people like it, and I understand that in some States, this is a program that is well regarded. It is not the case in every State.  To be clear, in 1976, the law was amended, and it was amended to remove that 60-percent State provision, stating simply that not less than 40 percent must be used for Federal purposes. Then it was silent on whether a State would, in fact, receive a penny.  The result? Well, it has been used for more Federal land acquisition than to actually care for, access, and manage the land that we already have, and 61 percent of funds have historically been used for acquisition, compared to the 25 percent that has historically been allocated to State grants. So millions of acres of land have been added to the Federal Government's already vast estate solely through the LWCF program.  Not surprisingly, the Federal Government has not always been a good steward of this land, and that is putting it mildly. Look, the sheer magnitude of unfunded needs on Federal lands is itself staggering. Now, this shouldn't be surprising. The Federal Government is run by human beings, and the Federal Government owns an enormous amount of land--a staggering amount of land. So for any one entity to own and manage that much land is going to be a daunting task, and I am not just talking here about neglect of garden variety BLM lands--those managed by the Bureau of Land Management or one of the other land management agencies of the Federal Government. A lot of those lands that comprise what we might describe as the crown jewels, even of our National Park System--those parts of the Federal public lands that the American people know and enjoy the most and identify most closely with what they like about Federal land management--even many of those have been neglected.  Take, for example, Grand Canyon National Park. We have deferred maintenance costs there of over $329 million. Yellowstone National Park has deferred maintenance of over $515 million. That is an enormous amount of land that is not being properly maintained. So in Yellowstone, here you have a picture of a road going through the park, and that road is completely pockmarked and made dangerous--in some places almost unusable--by potholes that haven't been repaired.  No American would necessarily want to drive down a road that looks like that. This is some of what happens when you continue to acquire more when you can't manage what you have.  Here in the Grand Canyon, we have a picture of a pipe that has sprung a leak and is leaking quite dangerously.  So what we have is a situation that, according to a 2017 CRS report, has resulted in a maintenance backlog of Federal lands totaling $18.6 billion.  Wildfires have run rampant in parts of the country, especially in the West, which the government has failed to prevent, and it is not just that they have failed to prevent those wildfires. It is not just that the Federal Government is not always well equipped to either prevent them in the first place or to fight them because of the vast inventory of lands that it has. In many instances, poor land management processes have resulted in severe environmental degradation that has itself been the predictable cause of widespread environmental catastrophe within Federal public lands.  To cite one of many examples, there is an infestation of a certain type of bark beetle within a certain area of federally owned forest. Locals understand that it is coming and ask the Federal Government to abate the nuisance, to address the infestation. The Federal Government refuses. The State and local authorities come back and say: OK, will you at least let us deal with the nuisance, get rid of the bark beetle so it doesn't destroy the trees, because if it destroys the trees, it is going to create a local environmental and economic catastrophe for our people. The Federal Government says no. So the bark beetle does its damage and destroys hundreds of thousands of acres of wooded area. It kills the trees. The trees then die.  The local populations go back to the Federal Government and say: These trees are dead. Will you cut them down so that we don't have this massive tinderbox of forest fire waiting to happen?  The Federal Government says no.  The people come back, those who live around the area, and say: Can we cut them down because, otherwise, this is going to be a tinderbox. There is going to be a fire. People are going to get hurt, and it is going to wreak havoc on our local environment.  The Federal Government still says no.  Then, guess what happens. Those trees catch on fire. They burn down, creating environmental catastrophe, disrupting the watershed, and this, in turn, leads to floods.  All of these things connect back up to poor Federal land management processes, and those poor Federal land management processes are the result of the fact that we have too much Federal land in the inventory to begin with.  Meanwhile, we have ill-kept roads and trails that, in some cases, have actually kept people away from our national treasures rather than allowing them to access them.  Furthermore, none of the current LWCF funds--not any of them--are directed toward maintenance or upkeep of these lands, including within our national parks.  But for years now, Congress has perpetuated the status quo of this broken, dangerous, and environmentally reckless program by reauthorizing it in giant omnibus spending bills or continuing resolutions without even the slightest incremental, modest reform. Worse still would be making reauthorization permanent. Indeed, it would deny us any regular opportunity as a Congress to actually reform and improve the program.  Second, the bill creates another 1.3 million acres of wilderness in the West--half of that being in Emery County, UT.  Now, at the outset, I want to say that wilderness designations might sound like a good thing, and sometimes they are. But this highly restrictive designation limits far more activities than is necessary in many, many instances to actually protect the land.  In fact, a wilderness designation prohibits almost all human activity. This land usually cannot be used for any commercial activity or any infrastructure. It cannot be developed for recreational purposes or traveled across by car, bus, automobile, or even a bicycle--even a bicycle made for that specific purpose--to say nothing of any type of agricultural development or timber harvesting. In a State like Utah, where the Federal Government owns more than two-thirds of the land, these designations have big consequences, especially for the poor and middle class in my State.  The amount of Federal land in Utah already sets out a great disadvantage to the people of Utah to begin with. While private landowners would pay property taxes on this land, and those taxes would go to the State and its political subdivisions, the Federal Government does not. It does not pay property taxes. So Utah is deprived of what should be and otherwise would be a huge source of revenue and of opportunity.  What does that mean? Well, as a result, our schools are underfunded, local governments are crippled, fire departments are, ironically, depleted and, therefore, unable to properly take care of the lands they are charged to protect in the first place, and many times strapped in their ability to provide basic services to those most in need.  With so much of this land in the grip of Federal bureaucrats, it is again limited in its use, in its opportunity, in its potential for use for development, for infrastructure, and for jobs that are essential to our State's economy--jobs that would be essential to any State's economy.  But with further wilderness designations by Congress, this is an even tighter grip. As the LWCF perpetuates the acquisition of even more Federal public land, communities like those throughout my State start to suffer even more. Citizens, you see, in this type of an environment have to go to the Federal Government, cap in hand, to ask permission for the use of any of the land at all, for access to any of the land at all, whether that means to dig a well, to build a road, to bury a cable, or to do virtually anything on it at all.  So designating more than 660,000 acres of wilderness in Emery County is of no small consequence.  I understand that a lot of people here like the fact that we are doing that. Make no mistake. They are not the people who live in Emery County. They are not the people who live within hundreds or even thousands of miles of Emery County.  Finally, this bill does nothing to address the imminent threat that Utah faces from unilateral Executive land grabs through the Antiquities Act.  To be clear, anything and everything that is designated as red on this map may be designated as a national monument overnight, at any moment, solely at the discretion of the President. Anything here is fair game to any President, at any time, to say: I now make you a monument.  Now, the Antiquities Act, passed in 1906, was intended to give the President of the United States the power to declare land that is already owned or controlled by the Federal Government as a national monument and to do so by Executive fiat. This was done in order to protect specific historic and cultural objects in the case of an emergency where they couldn't otherwise be protected. But instead of reserving the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected, as the law itself requires and as the text of the Antiquities Act itself mandates, Presidents in more modern times have designated enormous, million-acre monuments far beyond the scope of the objects in need of immediate protection.  These monument designations--perhaps the most restrictive of all Federal land designations--often do more harm than good. They radically undermine a State's economy by prohibiting energy production, mining, fishing, ranching, recreation, and a myriad of other uses.  Furthermore, without allowing Congress or the State legislature any actionable input in a decision like this, they effectively silence and disenfranchise the voices of the people closest to and most affected by and connected to the lands in question, depriving them of any say in the process. This is not fair. It is wrong, and it is something that needs to be addressed.  Take, for example, the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, designated by President Clinton in 1996. The Clinton administration designated 1.7 million acres of land--or about 67 percent of Kane County, UT, for the monument, all the while claiming that grazing would remain at historical levels.  But this promise, of course, was not kept. Since then, the BLM has revoked permits and closed much needed range land. You see, the men and women of the Bureau of Land Management, while well educated, well intentioned, and perhaps hard-working in many instances, are not from Utah. They don't respond to or stand accountable to anyone who is from Utah. They don't come from these parts of the country or from my State, where people's day-to-day livelihood and their ability to access their own land for their own purposes and to make a living--they don't have anything to do with this land. So why would they care? They don't.  Today, grazing is down almost one-third from what it had been more than two decades ago when the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument was proclaimed by President Clinton--proclaimed and designated as such, by the way, without any advance notice to the people of Utah, without the President even entering the State of Utah to do it.  Now, ranchers were hit hard. Many of them lost their ability to fence in water resources and maintain roads around them. In some cases, they could no longer bring water to their cattle, and many families were forced to reduce their herds, sometimes by half. This may not sound like much to someone who doesn't understand ranching or doesn't know anyone who makes their living off of ranching, but this means all the world to those people whose families for generations have supported themselves through ranching and ranching in that area where they are deeply connected to this land.  Of course, there was the designation of the Bears Ears National Monument by President Obama. The citizens of San Juan County, UT,--incidentally, Utah's poorest county--woke up on December 28, 2016, to find out that the Obama administration had unilaterally designated 1.35 million acres for that monument overnight, even though they had specifically pleaded against that.  Keep in mind that San Juan County has historically had some divisions--some of them along political lines, between Republicans and Democrats, and some of them along ethnic lines, between those who are Native American and those who are not.  This was an issue that united Democrats and Republicans alike in San Juan County. It united Native Americans in San Juan County and non-Native Americans in San Juan County like few issues ever have in San Juan County and few issues ever will in San Juan County. This brought them together because people from all walks of life opposed this if they lived in San Juan County.  President Obama, at the time he declared it, claimed this to have had the overwhelming support of Native American populations. What was often left out of that discussion is they were not the Native American populations in Utah. They were not the people who lived in San Juan County. They were people outside of this area, most of them out of State, who supported it. Yes, it is easy to designate something as wilderness or a national monument when it is not in your land, when it is not in your community, when it doesn't affect your way of life. That is what happens when we abuse Federal public land ownership. That is what happens when you take one State and decide the Federal Government is going to own more than two-thirds of the land in that State.  Imagine if in your State--or in any other State--any other land owner, whether an individual, a for-profit corporation, a nonprofit foundation, or anything else, owned more than, let's say, 5 percent of the land. People would be understandably, justifiably concerned that that person or that entity or that nonprofit, or whatever it was, could have a disproportionate, outsized impact on that State's economy.  Imagine if that number were increased to include not just 5 percent of the land in your State, but 10, 15, 20, 25 percent of the land. As you rounded the corner of 30 percent, people would start to get freaked out. Imagine if that number then soared above that--35, 40, 45, 50 percent--until it got up to nearly 70 percent of the land in your State. Imagine further that, at that point, that landowner declared itself exempt from all forms of property taxation. That would create problems for your State.  This is what I beg and plead for my colleagues from around the country, particularly those who live east of Colorado, to understand. It is really easy to support these things when it is in somebody else's State. It is really for people on the northeastern seaboard to look at Utah and say: Well, it is just one of those square States. They have plenty of land out there. They have plenty of room. They don't need to worry about it.  Try living there. Try earning a living there for your family. It is not right. This goes against so much of what we believe in, in this country.  Federal land ownership is not the only unfair thing about this. Again, Federal land ownership makes possible the designation unilaterally, by one person, of a national monument, and if that one person happens to decide that a particular State ought to be the next victim, that person will make it so.  It just so happens that, just as Utah has a disproportionate share of Federal public land in its State, so, too, is it a disproportionate victim under the Antiquities Act. Since the passage of the Antiquities Act, Presidents have designated 77.85 million acres of land as national monuments, and 87 percent of that has been designated in the last 40 years. Of the land that has been designated as a monument over the last 25 years, 3.23 million acres, or 28 percent, are in Utah. All of the land in the United States designated as a monument in the last 25 years, that portion--nearly 30 percent--is in my State. Why is that fair? It is not, especially when you consider the harm done to the economies, the disruption that takes place as a result of these designations, the widespread opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike, and in San Juan County the Native American population and the non-Native American population alike are overwhelmingly against this.  What was intended to be an act of cultural preservation has, sadly, deteriorated into a greedy, harmful Federal land grab. As it currently stands, there is always the threat of a decision coming down from on high that will utterly decimate the livelihoods of people in Utah. There is no good reason for this.  Already, two other States have felt the abuse of the Antiquities Act within their borders, and they have received relief. In the 1950s, Wyoming and Alaska successfully called on Congress to grant them Antiquities Act protections. Why? Because they had been disproportionately burdened by this law. As a result of their efforts, in Wyoming, any monument designation must be approved by Congress, and, in Alaska, any designation made by Presidential fiat that exceeds 5,000 acres must be approved by Congress.  To be clear, in both of these States, Congress still has the power to designate this. It is just that they are saying, for those States where it has been abused in the past, Congress as a whole--people's elected lawmakers as a whole in Congress--ought to be the ones designating, rather than putting it in the hands of one person.  There is no reason why the people of Utah, who have suffered more under the Antiquities Act than any other population in the entire country, should be treated any differently. There is no reason Utahns should live under this constant threat of abuse. That is why we have offered an amendment that would remedy this.  With permanent authorization of the LWCF, which will result only in a greater Federal land footprint, and with the roughly 660,000 acres of new wilderness designation in Utah, I fear my State is at even greater risk for yet another monument designation. Thus, at a bare minimum, Utah deserves the same protection Wyoming has received. Our amendment would add just two words: ``or Utah.'' Without it, I simply cannot vote for this bill. With it, it gives us the protection we deserve and protection that other States like ours have already received.  In a day and age when we have to deal with 680-page bills dropped on our desks at 10 a.m. on the day we are asked to pass it or a 2,232 page spending bill, as we faced last March for the omnibus spending package, a bill that is not two pages long, but just two words long, should be welcomed.  There is much that is wrong with our Federal land policy in the West, and, unfortunately, much of that is something that this bill fails to correct. Utahns, and Americans, deserve better than the stranglehold that the Federal Government is exercising over so much of our country's lands. Yet Washington greedily continues to grab more, year after year, imposing tighter and tighter restrictions, all the while failing to maintain the lands that it already owns. These lands will not be national treasures for everyone if we can't take care of them in the first place. Indeed, they will be treasures for no one if we continue along this same pattern of willful neglect.  Let me be very clear. My opposition today is not about whether our national treasures or parks or monuments or lands should be protected. It is not about whether they should be, but how to do that and who is best equipped to do that and who is most knowledgeable to do it well.  What I am asking for is for Utah's elected leaders--its elected lawmakers in Congress--to at least be given a chance to weigh in on these matters before they become law, rather than to have those decisions being made from thousands of miles away by just one person. Indeed, the very best way to ensure that these national treasures are protected and recreation available is to empower our States and our local communities, which understand and appreciate their backyards best. They know which land to prioritize, and they know how to make that happen.  Just look at the State and local ballot initiatives in the last few decades to see the evidence. Since 1988, these State initiatives have approved over $72 billion in combined expenditures for recreation and conservation. These things matter to States and local communities, and they have already raised huge funds and found ways to preserve and competently manage their public lands.  Protection of our lands will happen without the Federal Government's thumb on the scale, and it will happen in a way that actually makes these treasures more available for future generations. We will not be helping them preserve them, however, by denying access to the people who are in the best position themselves to preserve them; that is, the people who live and work and recreate on them, the people whose lives are interwoven with them and have been for generations. And we will not be helping the American people by depriving them of their livelihoods. That is why I have introduced amendments that would make reforms and improvements to the LWCF, the Emery County wilderness designation bill and other provisions in this package--amendments that would steer our lands policy in a better direction, at least as a starting point.  These are conversations worth having. They need to be had, and we ought to have them. But at a bare minimum, with the least shred of compromise, we could add just those two words--``or Utah''--to give Utahns justice, to give them a voice in managing and caring for their lands."

He and I have had some opportunity to speak to this issue, and I certainly agree with him when it comes to the policy goals that he is seeking to assert here. I clearly understand the frustration he has.  With the previous administration, I believe we have seen a real abuse of authority--certainly an abuse of the spirit--of the Antiquities Act. We saw that in Utah when millions of acres were locked up through Executive designation. This was done despite some pretty robust local opposition and objection.  This is a scenario that I know pretty well because, in my State, we have a Federal landlord that owns about 63 percent of the State, 224 million acres. We have a provision in ANILCA that is a specific no-more clause, prohibiting the withdrawal of more than 5,000 acres absent congressional approval. The Obama administration circumvented that law. They placed hundreds of thousands of additional acres off limits to development.  What my colleague is seeking here, the ability to affirm or reject a monument designation by the State of Utah, is something that, again, I truly understand. I have supported legislation and introduction of legislation to do just as he has done--maybe not specific to one State but making sure that we truly do respect the spirit of the Antiquities Act and making sure, when monuments and monument designations move forward, that they are done with local support.  I am in a bit of a quandary here because what he is advocating for is something that, again, I have been there with him on. But our dilemma, if you will, is that we have a package before us of lands bills, of water bills, of sportsmen's provisions, of conservation provisions that we have been working to kind of--not kind of, but to build that level of consensus.  This measure is one that has been identified by those with whom we have been trying to work, not only here in this body but with the House as well. They have identified this as one of those measures that would bring down this effort. So we are in a position where, while I support the goals the Senator is seeking to achieve, I don't see a path forward for it in this Chamber at this time.  As I mentioned--as you have heard me say--we have some very important provisions that we have been working on for a period of years. I want to ensure those proceed. I don't want to see S. 47 fall. So I am going to move to table the Lee amendment, but I want to once again commit to the Senator from Utah that I will work with him, as the chairman of the Energy Committee, to address these monument designations.  Given the vehicle that we have in front of us, I will move to table and ask that colleagues join me in this tabling motion.  Mr. President, at this moment, I move to table the Lee amendment No. 187."

While I was pleased that we could reach agreement to include a designation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area in the substitute amendment, I want to clarify what this designation does and, perhaps more importantly, what it does not do.  The purpose of this designation, as with congressionally designated National Heritage Areas in general, is to celebrate the region's history and cultural heritage by promoting education, tourism, recreation, and other historic values. It also creates the opportunity for Federal participation in promoting these regional attributes.  In no way does this designation implicate or interfere with any water facilities or operations associated with the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. We are not creating new regulatory authority or modifying existing regulatory authority, including those related to land or water use, at any level of government.  Further, S. 47 includes protections to ensure that private property will not be impacted by the designation, protections that apply to the ownership and use of water rights both inside and outside of the National Heritage Area's boundary.  I ask Senator Feinstein, you have championed this National Heritage Area designation for quite some time. In her view, have I properly characterized the intended effect of this designation?"

The general protections and limitations, along with the inclusion of language specific to Delta water operations, makes certain that the designation of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area will not affect or influence water operations of the Central Valley Project, State Water Project, or other water supply facilities within the Bay-Delta watershed, including a reduction in water exports from the Bay-Delta. I am pleased that we have included additional language to dispel any such concerns and make absolutely certain that no one reads anything into the legislation that is not there and was never intended.

                "speech":"Mr. President, 2 and a half weeks ago, Democrats and Republicans--the House, the Senate, and the White House--agreed to reopen the government for 3 weeks to be able to continue negotiations on border security.  A very simple statement that was made by my Democratic colleagues was this: Reopen the government for 3 weeks. We will negotiate on border security and come to an agreement, but only if the government is open, and it would be limited to border security.  It was a pretty straightforward conversation.  President Trump said: We trust you on this.  We agreed to reopen the government for 3 weeks to focus on border security.  Now it appears that based on the negotiations that are happening right now in this building, this has become a Lucy-and-the-football-type negotiation because this doesn't seem to be about border security anymore.  My Democratic colleagues have said: Now we want to add one thing. We will vote for fencing at the border as long as you agree to defund a section of ICE.  The whole negotiation now is this: Yes, we will add border fencing, but you have to agree to defund ICE.  Here is the way that works. Their agreement is this: You will have to limit the number of people that ICE can detain.  Now, to our credit, this Congress has always allocated funding to say: Here is x amount of dollars for detention facilities and for bed space for ICE, knowing that if somebody is picked up at the border, when they are picked up at the border as they cross, the Border Patrol does not house them. They are not detained by Border Patrol. They are arrested by Border Patrol, and then they are turned over to ICE.  So the plan is not to allocate enough dollars for ICE detention but to create a new arbitrary cap for the number of people that ICE could actually detain, so that ICE could only hold x amount of people. That is what they want to get a negotiation--for the first time ever to have a maximum cap of the number of people that ICE could detain.  Why does that matter? One is to allow funding for it, and another one is to have a cap. A cap is very different, and my Democratic colleagues know it.  In real life, here is what it would look like. If ICE, at any point, already had the number they have in custody at that point and they arrest someone else, they would have to choose to release someone currently in detention before they could arrest someone and put them in detention.  Let me give an example.  Coyotes now try for any adult who is coming to try to have them bring a child with them because they know if a child travels with the adult, they are going to get a special lane into the country, as if they are coming as a family. They get their own fast lane into being released into the country.  If you have this ICE detainer cap, coyotes will know: Bring people in mass migration because ICE can't release enough people at once. So if you come as a thousand across the border or 500 across the border, they have to be released into the country because ICE can't quickly release 500 people from detention to add the new 500 people who are coming through.  My Democratic colleagues also know that it currently takes about 41 days for someone who is in detention to go through the whole process to get a hearing and get finished. This would accelerate the process of getting those people out and released into the country, rather than getting them through the actual hearing.  The better solution on this is to add judges and actually get people to go through the process and get due process faster, instead of releasing people into the country. Once someone crosses our border illegally and they are released into the country, the vast majority of those individuals never get deported because they either don't show up for the hearing at all or, when they do show up for the hearing and they are told, no, you can't legally stay, they disappear.  This cap negotiation that is going on right now is exactly the wrong direction to go. It is not about border security. It is about releasing people into the country.  Several years ago, there was a young lady named Sarah Root. She was in Iowa. It was graduation night from college, and she was hit by a drunk driver and killed. Sarah Root's loss drew the Nation's attention for a moment to the issue of not only drunk driving but illegal immigration, because the person that hit Sarah was illegally present in the country and had a blood alcohol level three times above the legal limit.  Local law enforcement, at that time under the Obama administration, asked ICE to detain them. ICE said they didn't meet the minimum qualification that had been set by the administration to detain them. So they released this person on bond. Sarah later died from her injuries, and they have never been able to find that guy again. He is gone. He is somewhere in the United States, or maybe he is running internationally. We don't know, but he is on our most wanted list instead of being held.  That was a decision made by a previous administration just on priorities. My Democratic colleagues are trying to force ICE to make those kinds of decisions every single day now--to determine who needs to be released and who needs to be kept based on an arbitrary cap that they want to put in on the maximum number of people that ICE can detain.  There is no State in the country that sets an arbitrary cap, other than the bed space that they have available. But this conversation is that we have enough bed space to hold someone, but you can't use that bed space because we want to limit the number of people that ICE can detain.  This is the current debate on border security. It is not about border security anymore. It is not about fencing anymore. It is now about giving ICE a maximum cap they can detain and, literally, forcing ICE to release people illegally present into the United States. That is not border security. That is the opposite of border security, and we should not go for a deal that puts a cap on ICE that is an arbitrary number.  I hope this administration rejects that. I hope we can finish negotiations. I hope the American people see this for what it is. This is no longer about border security. This is about trying to force this administration to release people into the country who are illegally present and prevent ICE from doing its job. Enough is enough on this. Let's allow the ICE folks to be able to do their job--they are Federal law enforcement--and not put a cap on them, saying: You can only enforce the law this far, and then after that, you cannot enforce the law anymore because we have an arbitrary cap. That needs to be rejected, and that is not a serious offer in negotiations.  The reason we don't already have a deal that is already done right now, with this body debating it, is that debate about capping ICE detentions got added into the conversation last weekend and blew up the whole negotiation.  This is not the White House blowing up negotiations. This is not Republicans blowing up negotiations. This is my Democratic colleagues saying they want a cap on ICE detentions and allowing coyotes to be able to rush large quantities at the border or forcing ICE to have to make difficult choices about which gang members they are going to release and which they are going to hold, literally getting a briefing every morning saying: We can't arrest anyone today because we don't have enough detention space, so today we have to look the other way.  That is an absurd proposal, and we should reject it.  With that, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum."

                "speech":"Mr. President, I rise to discuss two economic issues this evening. The first is a reaction to a proposal that comes to us from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Let me preface this with the observation that I am pretty sure we are living through the strongest economy in the United States in my adult lifetime. It has been fantastic for the people I represent.  Our unemployment rate is pretty much at a 50-year low. African-American and Hispanic unemployment is the lowest that has ever been recorded. The youth unemployment rate is extremely low. It is at historically low levels. Our economy has accelerated, and wages are growing exactly as we said they would. It is very simple. The demand for workers has grown so much that employers are being forced to bid ever higher for the services of the workers.  Now we are in a tremendously enviable position of having more job openings in America than there are people looking for work in America. It is fantastic. This is exactly what we want to have happen.  Last week, the President was right when he said that our economy is the envy of the world. It is totally true.  So what do our colleagues on the other side of the aisle propose to do in light of the fact that we have this fantastic economy? Well, Senator Sanders and Senator Schumer joined up and made a proposal that we adopt legislation that would severely restrict the ability of American companies to buy back their own stock. This is just the latest iteration of a socialist tendency that seems to be growing on the far left. This is a horrendous idea.  I suppose we shouldn't be surprised when we hear a Socialist-leaning idea coming from a self-described Democratic Socialist or a Socialist Democrat--whatever the description is--but I am surprised to hear this coming from the Senate minority leader.  Let's talk about this a little bit. First of all, what is a stock buyback? It is not that complicated. It is when the owners of a company take some or all of their money out of the company.  Let's think about it this way. A business is owned by its shareholders, and the shareholders hire a management team to take their money and invest it in a way that will generate a return for the investor, for the shareholder. That is the role of the management team.  So why would they buy back their own stock? The reason they would buy back their own stock is that sometimes it happens that the management team of a company is just not able to deploy any more capital in a way that would generate a better return than what is generally available in the marketplace. What sometimes happens is companies might make huge investments; they may be investing tremendous amounts--record amounts--in expanding their capabilities, expanding their production, more R&D, and expanding their staff, but they can reach a limit as to how much they can expand and how much they productively invest at any given point. If they have more money--more cash--than they can productively deploy, they have an obligation to return that to the people who actually own it; that is, the shareholders, the investors. That is their obligation.  Shockingly, Senators Sanders and Schumer are suggesting that companies be forbidden from being able to return some portion of their excess capital to their shareholders unless the company first complies with a list of political demands that Senators Schumer and Sanders are advocating.  Let me tell you why this is such a bad idea. I will give you three reasons. No. 1, it is a disturbing and profound attack on freedom. No. 2, it would be terrible for the economy. And, No. 3, it would hurt the very people they presumably intend to help. Let me go through them in order.  First of all, as far as freedom goes, whose company is it? To whom does a given company in America belong? I have always thought they belonged to the shareholders of those companies--the people who saved up and invested in them, the people who have launched those companies, and the people whose capital made it possible. So, of course, it should be within the rights of the people who own a company to decide what to do with the profits after all expenses have been covered and taxes have been paid. That is what we are talking about here.  I have a question for my colleagues. The question is, What principle confers on politicians the right to control whether and when and under what circumstances an investor can withdraw his own money from a business in which he invested? I don't know what that principle is.  I will say, to me, it seems exactly equivalent to confiscating the property of somebody--in this case, their ownership in a business--and redistributing that confiscated asset to whomever they choose. That strikes me as pretty close to the definition of socialism. It clearly is an attack on the economic freedom that underpins our entire economy, an entire market economy.  My second point, and related, is this would be terrible for the economy. It would do great harm to an economy that is doing quite well right now. The main way it would be so damaging is it would scare away capital.  Just stop and think about it. Our economy thrives when people are willing to invest in existing businesses, in new businesses, and in startup businesses, but that investment is an absolutely essential part of a thriving economy. Well, people are much less likely to make an investment if Congress makes it harder to take that investment out. So what we would do is we would dry up sources of capital for companies that need that capital because investors would understandably say: Well, we are heading down the road of putting all kinds of limits on my ability to ever get my money out. I think it may be good to just park it and not invest it.  That would be a very bad development.  The proponents of this idea of restricting companies this way say they want to ``incentivize productive investment.'' I have to laugh because I have a secret for our colleagues. You see, the free enterprise system already provides an incentive for productive investment. It is called the profit. That is the whole idea. So we don't need to punish people for making an investment as a way to incentivize productive investment. In fact, it will not work at all.  I think some of what they have argued displays a little bit of confusion about how this works. In their argument about why something has to be done, they say that 90 percent of profits go to buybacks and dividends. What else would you use it for? I mean, you first have to cover all of your expenses before you have a profit. So you could have record amounts of research and development, record amounts of expansion, records amounts of employment, and growth in employment, but after all of that is covered, only then do you have the profit. That is what is left over. And after you have covered all of those things, why wouldn't you have buybacks and a distribution to the investors?  That raises this question: Exactly what problem is it that our colleagues think they are solving here? We are running at record high levels of investment in our economy. Capital expenditures have gone through the roof in response partly--largely--due to the change in the tax law that we made. The buybacks that have been occurring have coincided with record levels of investment. What is the problem here?  By the way, as I pointed out earlier, wage growth has accelerated at the highest rate we have seen in many, many years. I really don't understand what problem they think we are solving.  By the way, there is an alternative to distributing excess capital to shareholders. The alternative is keeping the capital trapped in the company where it is not being put to its most productive use. You see, one of the great dynamics of a market economy is that by returning excess capital to shareholders, the shareholders get to decide what new idea deserves to be funded by recycling this capital. Whether it is in the form of dividends or stock buybacks, we encourage this capital to find a new home--a new startup, a new idea, or an expansion of an existing business. The capital is constantly being redirected to the best ideas, as long as you allow it to happen.  Finally, this idea would be very harmful to the people it is, presumably, meant to help. About 40 percent of all equities in the United States are held in pension and retirement accounts. These are the accounts of teachers and cabdrivers and truckdrivers and folks who work at factories and do every other job that our economy depends on, who put a little money away. It may be in a 401(k) plan, in an IRA, or in an employer-sponsored pension plan; these folks own an awful lot of the stock in America. Well, buybacks are good for their investment because, in some cases, it returns cash that can then be redeployed. In other cases, it provides a bid; it provides upward pressure on the stock price, which is good for the value of their savings. Over time, if the stock gets retired, then the diminished supply gets that much greater a share of all of the future earnings. This is completely a win-win for savers and investors.  Let me just conclude by saying it is a very, very bad idea for America to take any steps down the road toward socialism. This is very much an idea of that ilk. In fact, it is a big step in the direction of a collectivist socialist economy, and we should reject this out of hand. Mr. President, I also want to touch on an unrelated topic, but it is an important one; that is, the ongoing discussion we are having in this Congress and across the country with respect to trade.  I think most of us in this Chamber agree that international trade is very good for the United States. I know it is very good for Pennsylvania.  I think we all understand that if we impose tariffs on imported goods, that is a tax that American consumers have to pay on a product or a service just because it originates somewhere else. If you add up the impact of the tariffs that this administration has already applied, according to the Congressional Budget Office, that is already going to take one-tenth of a percent off of our GDP, off of our economic growth. That is assuming no further tariffs occur, which is unknown at this point.  In particular, I want to address a category of tariffs that are known as section 232 tariffs because that is the part of the trade law which justifies these tariffs. This is an old law. It is a Cold War-era trade law that is designed to allow a President to impose tariffs when he believes there is a national security threat that requires these tariffs, these taxes on some foreign product for some reason that affects our national security.  In my view, the recent imposition of these 232 tariffs on aluminum and steel were not really about national security. They had other motives and other purposes, and, in my view, they have done much more harm than good.  If you look at tariffs on imported steel, you might believe that it is helpful to the people who are in the steel industry. We have about 140,000 Americans employed at steel mills. It is possible that the tariffs are helpful to those companies and those employees at some level. The problem is, we have 6.5 million people in companies that use many, many multiples, and everybody who works in that sector of our economy across a wide range of industries is put at a competitive disadvantage when they have to pay that tax on imported steel and aluminum.  Some examples come to mind. Allegheny Technologies is a company in western Pennsylvania that last year had to pay $16 million in taxes on the steel they imported. They had no choice but to import it because of the unique nature of that steel. It is threatening one of their production facilities.  American Keg is the only steel keg maker in the United States and makes beer kegs in Pennsylvania. They had to lay off one-third of their workers in March of last year because they are not as competitive as they need to be.  Colonial Metal Products is a small manufacturer. They use steel in fabrication. Their entire workforce is at risk.  The list goes on and on because fundamentally these taxes make many companies that use steel and aluminum less competitive.  That is not the only problem. As we all know, many American exporters are subject to retaliation by companies that experience these tariffs. So there are a lot of problems.  I have introduced legislation that is meant to address this. One aspect of this that I think is very important is that the Constitution unambiguously assigns to Congress the responsibility for managing our economic relations--our competing trade relations with other countries. In the Constitution, that explicitly includes the responsibility for deciding whether and to what extent we should impose tariffs on the products of other countries. Yet for years Congress has just let administration after administration take this responsibility that the Constitution gives to us.  So what my legislation does is pretty simple. It says, let's restore to Congress the responsibility that the Constitution gives to Congress. Let's make sure that national security-related tariffs are only imposed when Congress says they should be imposed.  The legislation has 11 original cosponsors, roughly even between Republicans and Democrats. Senator Warner is the lead Democrat on this bill, and Senators Sasse and Hassan are also original cosponsors. Four of the cosponsors are from the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over this issue. There is the House companion, which is also bipartisan. There are 61 organizations, business groups and others, that have endorsed this from the outside.  It is important to make the point that our legislation, while it is designed to restore to Congress this important responsibility, doesn't eliminate the ability of a President to invoke section 232 and impose tariffs if there is a genuine threat to American security. What the President needs to do is explain the threat, make the case to the Congress, and under our legislation, there is a mechanism that requires expedited consideration of the President's request. It can't be filibustered. It doesn't take 60 votes. There is a strict timeline. So this can't languish on a shelf somewhere; Congress has to respond.  One other feature that is important in this bill is that the executive branch determination of whether there is a threat to national security would no longer be conducted by the Commerce Department, as it is now; it would move to the Department of Defense. My view on that is very simple. The Department of Defense is the entity within our executive branch that is best qualified to determined threats to our national security.  I am hopeful that we will grow our support and be able to get a vote on this legislation.  I should point out that there are other legislative approaches. There are other ideas on 232. There is one bill that, like mine, would shift the responsibility for evaluating the threat from the Commerce Department to the Defense Department, but the difference with some of these other pieces of legislation is they contemplate a disapproval resolution. They simply observe that Congress can pass a law to prevent or rescind a 232 designation, but these alternative bills would do nothing to restore that responsibility to Congress today. We could pass a law if we had the votes, and we could override a Presidential veto. We could pass a law to rescind any kind of tariff. The alternative legislation doesn't change that fact. What my legislation does is it would require the affirmative consent of Congress before the tariffs can go into place. That is a fundamental difference.  So I think, for the sake of expanding trade, but importantly, in my mind, for the sake of restoring the constitutional responsibility that is assigned to Congress, we ought to pass this legislation.  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum."

I have been a strong supporter of home care since my very first home visit early in my Senate service. This experience gave me the opportunity to meet and to visit with home healthcare patients, where I saw firsthand what a difference highly skilled, caring visiting nurses and other healthcare professionals make in the lives of patients and their families. I have been a passionate advocate of home healthcare ever since.  The highly skilled and compassionate care that home health agencies provide in the State of Maine and across the country have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and to stay just where they want to be--in the comfort, privacy, and security of their own homes.  As we look to the future, home health services will continue to be in high demand. The Census projects that by the year 2030, the proportion of U.S. residents older than age 65 will have nearly doubled from 2010.  The Home Health Payment Innovation Act, which I have introduced with Senator Stabenow, Senator Kennedy, Senator Jones, Senator Cassidy, and Senator Paul, preserves access to existing home health services under the Medicare Program, while also providing a pathway for innovative approaches to using these vital services. This bipartisan legislation is endorsed by the National Association of Home Care and Hospice, as well as by the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare.  Our bill would make two key adjustments in home health payment reform provisions that were passed last year. First, it would prevent unwarranted payment rate cuts by basing any behavioral adjustments on actual evidence. Second, it would limit the risk of disruption in care by providing a phase-in for any necessary rate increases or decreases. This phase-in is critical for home health providers, as CMS has already proposed cutting Medicare payment rates in 2020 by more than $1 billion in the first year alone, based purely on assumptions of changes in behavior.  Our bill also provides the pathway to expanded use of home healthcare in the Medicare Program without increasing program spending  It provides flexibility on waiving what is called the ``homebound requirement'' for home health services when a plan or innovative care delivery model, such as an accountable care organization, determines that providing care to the patient in the home would improve outcomes and reduce spending on patient care.  As plans and providers continue to experiment with innovative ways to deliver care and improve value in Medicare spending, allowing them the flexibility to waive this limitation--the homebound limitation--will help to advance the goals of ensuring that care is delivered at the right time, in the right place, and at the right cost."

The town was originally settled in 1869 by hardworking Swedish farmers who, like my great-grandfather, had left Sweden because of the potato famine.  These farmers were new to America and new to the landscape and climate of Kansas. Their goal was to establish a home and community rich in Swedish culture, religion, and business.  Today, Lindsborg is a bright, vibrant community where retailers feature unique traditional Swedish treats and artwork; where visitors can walk up and down the streets and Main Street and find more than 15 wild Dala horses painted to represent a unique piece of Lindsborg's culture. My own family often has one of these Dala horses in their entryway as folks enter their house.  It is a community that is proud of its heritage and comes together to carry on a variety of Swedish festivals and traditions honoring its original settlers.  I, myself, am one-quarter Swedish and very proud of this fact. Growing up, we kept many Swedish traditions in our family. We celebrated them whenever we had the occasion. Still today, our Christmas Eve dinners always feature various Swedish dishes, including pickled herring, anchovies, hardtack crackers, Swedish candies, and desserts. My mom, brother, and wife to this day enjoy their annual pilgrimage to Lindsborg to pick out their very special Swedish Christmas gifts.  In 2010, I was able to take my mother back to Sweden, along with my oldest son and daughter, and view the home that my grandfather had built; the farm where they farmed; the fences they had built out of stone; the barns they had built out of stone, still functional and standing today; and the water well my great-grandfather had dug. All of those parts of the farm were still functioning.  I was able to see the church where my great-grandfather and great-grandmother were married and see the cemetery where many of our relatives are buried to this day. It is a trip I will never forget.  I am very proud of my Swedish roots, and I am honored to represent Bethany College and the town of Lindsborg. This town will always have a very special place in my heart, and it is my honor to sponsor the resolution that celebrates this milestone for Lindsborg. I can't wait until this year's Messiah Festival, when we will get to watch them live there in Lindsborg.

Former Representative  John Duncan from Tennessee first sponsored a bill to improve Presidential libraries 19 years ago. A bill identical to the one before us passed the House in the last Congress with bipartisan support. I hope we now can finally get this important reform enacted.  The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would make the process for building Presidential libraries more transparent. Presidential libraries have become increasingly expensive as they have evolved into multipurpose centers.  The costs for building a Presidential library must come from private funding, and modern libraries cost millions--in some cases, hundreds of millions--of dollars to build.  The George W. Bush Presidential Center, for example, cost an estimated $250 million to build, and President Bush raised approximately $500 million for the building and an endowment for his library, museum, and institute.  Although President Obama has raised hundreds of millions of dollars for his Presidential library, he has voluntarily disclosed the names of those who have donated $200 or more.  We should not, however, rely on such voluntary disclosures. Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities of those who donate to a Presidential library, and a President, while still in office, is able to raise an unlimited amount from private donations.  There is no limitation on who can donate to a sitting President for a Presidential library, or how much they can donate, and their identities remain secret.  This bill would require organizations that raise money to build Presidential libraries to disclose the identity of any individual who donates more than $200. The National Archives and Records Administration would then be required to post the donation information online.  The bill would also create criminal penalties for individuals who report false information on donations and for fundraising organizations that omit donation information.  A group of 15 good government organizations, including Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Sunlight Foundation, sent a letter last Congress urging the House to support this bill.  Here is what they wrote: ``Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds privately to establish their Presidential libraries. These efforts, which often begin long before they leave office, are unregulated and undisclosed, creating opportunities for, and/or the appearance of, influence peddling. Improved transparency would help reduce the appearance of impropriety and help deter inappropriate behavior.''

The bipartisan Presidential Library Donation Reform Act, which was introduced by the gentleman from Maryland, my good friend, Mr. Cummings, is certainly one worthy of our support, Mr. Speaker.  Under current law, Presidents can fundraise for their Presidential libraries through private, unlimited donations while they are still in office. There are no current requirements for any Presidential library fundraising organization to disclose the source or size of the donation it receives. Donations can be from individuals, companies, associations, and foreign governments, with no transparency.  Presidential libraries have become more expensive throughout the years. President Clinton's library cost $165 million. President Bush's cost $250 million. President Obama's is projected to cost more than $500 million.  This bill requires Presidential library fundraising organizations to disclose to the National Archives information about contributors who have donated $200 or more in any quarter. The National Archives would then be tasked with making the data available on its website in a downloadable format.  H.R. 1063 also sunsets the disclosure requirement to when the management of the actual library is transferred to the National Archives.  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan piece of legislation.

Mr. Speaker, I was at one of these hearings where we were talking about this very issue and how it was just mind-boggling that we would not use current protocols, in terms of looking at national security clearances and the approval thereof.  It was Mr. Lynch's initiative here to actually address that in a legislative manner, and I support his good work there.  Millions of Americans use social media to interact with family members, friends, and followers. Public posts on social media websites occasionally provide a unique insight into a person's character and interests.  In several high-profile cases, Federal contractors with valid security clearances who leaked classified information had posted highly suspicious entries on their social media accounts.  For example, Edward Snowden used various online aliases to post suspicious content on the comment boards of a tech magazine before he received his security clearance. A simple check--mind you, a simple check--would have let us know of these suspicious activities and certainly could have worked to mitigate some of the damages that we all know too well.  Private companies and private citizens can and often do search publicly available social media accounts to learn more about job applicants. However, our government does not regularly check the social media of individuals who have applied for security clearances.  On May 12, 2016, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued a new policy permitting the use of public social media information in security clearance investigations. Despite that legal clearance, most security clearance investigations still do not involve a social media check.  Various Federal entities have studied the potential use of social media information in background investigations for at least a decade. The National Security Agency, the Army, OPM, and others have conducted pilot programs on the effectiveness of social media checks, and it is not clear what use has been made of this data for these programs or whether the programs can be expanded to cover more applicants.  Concerning online behavior should be one of many factors used to evaluate a person's fitness to access classified information.  H.R. 1065, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, is a step toward creating a more holistic security clearance review process. The bill requires OMB to evaluate pilot programs conducted to date and estimate the costs of wider implementation of publicly available social media checks.  This report is due within 6 months and will help guide subsequent legislation to require checks of publicly available data. We cannot wait any longer to modernize our security clearance process.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this thoughtful piece of legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.  As chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1065, the Social Media Use in Clearance Investigations Act, bipartisan legislation that I introduced earlier this month. It had passed this House previously, last session, with no opposition.  I commend our full committee chairman, Mr. Cummings of Maryland, for his continued leadership on this issue of security clearance reform and for his work to advance H.R. 1065 to the floor today.  I also thank the new ranking member of our subcommittee, Mr. Hice of Georgia, for his support as well.  In order to enhance the Federal security clearance process, H.R. 1065 will require the Office of Management and Budget to examine the extent to which Federal agencies are reviewing publicly available social media profiles as they conduct background investigations for security clearance applicants.  This bill will also require OMB to submit recommendations to Congress on how we can implement this examination of social media activity in clearance investigations across the Federal Government while also safeguarding individual privacy rights.  Our bipartisan oversight of the security clearance process has already revealed that Federal agencies have too often missed red flags in determining an individual's eligibility to access classified information and facilities. We need only recall the tragic shooting at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013 to underscore the devastating impact of a failure to effectively vet security clearance holders such as Aaron Alexis, a defense contractor with a marked history of gun violence who was still issued a secret-level clearance. Chief among the recommendations offered by the interagency council that President Obama convened to identify lapses in security clearance reviews was the need for agencies to have ``access to relevant information from a variety of sources.''  As noted by William Evanina, the head of counterintelligence for the U.S. government since 2014, his quote is:       Social media has become an integral and very public part of      the fabric of many Americans' daily lives. And we cannot      ignore this important open source in our effort to safeguard      our national interests.  Moreover, a public social media profile adds to the ``mosaic'' of a person and may reveal to background investigators evidence suggesting a change in ideology, ill intent, vulnerability to blackmail, and allegiance to another country.  The integration of social media into security clearance background investigations falls in line with the unprecedented exploitation of Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and other networking services by terrorist organizations, including the Islamic State.  As reported by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, the prolific use of social media by terrorist groups has not only facilitated the dissemination of propaganda, but also served as a primary global recruitment and financing tool.  Foreign governments are also increasingly relying on social media to advance their espionage efforts. According to open source reports, Chinese spy agencies have routinely resorted to using fake LinkedIn accounts to try to recruit Americans with access to government and commercial secrets.  ``60 Minutes'' recently reported that former CIA officer Kevin Mallory, who has been convicted on espionage charges, was first approached by his Chinese government handlers through the LinkedIn career networking site.  In advance of our 2016 subcommittee hearing on this issue, then-Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, directed Federal agencies to integrate public social media reviews into the security clearance process. While this directive was a step in the right direction, it has been incorporated quite unevenly and on a limited basis.  Our bill, H.R. 1065, will advance the full integration of this important reform to better ensure that our national security framework is adapting to evolving technologies much faster than the usual pace that is characteristic of the Federal Government.  I would note that, according to the annual job recruitment survey issued by CareerBuilder, an online employment resource, seven out of 10 private sector employers have already incorporated social media reviews into their hiring process.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind remarks in reference to this bill, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support H.R. 1065."

I introduced this bill, along with the distinguished Congressman from North Carolina, Mr. Mark Meadows, to make it easier for whistleblowers to disclose wrongdoing. This bill would protect whistleblowers who report waste, fraud, or abuse, to their supervisors at a government agency.  Under current law, an employee would not be protected from retaliation for disclosing information to a supervisor, even if the employee reasonably believes it is necessary to expose a violation of a law, rule, or regulation. A whistleblower is currently only protected by law if they make their disclosures to the Office of Special Counsel, an Inspector General, Congress, the head of the whistleblower's agency, or an employee designated by the head of the agency.  Under this bill, an employee who is covered by the Whistleblower Protection Act could report alleged misconduct to any supervisor in their direct chain of command. This sensible change in law would allow employees to provide evidence of wrongdoing to a supervisor instead of requiring employees to report all the way up to the head of an agency or an inspector general.  This change in the law would protect employees who use the proper channels at their agency to report waste, fraud, and abuse. Employees in the intelligence community already have these whistleblower protections as a result of a Presidential policy directive issued in 2012. This bill would ensure that all federal employees have the same protections as whistleblowers in the intelligence community.  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

I rise in support of H.R. 1064, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her leadership on this effort. Any time that you support whistleblowers, it is a good day in Congress; and to do that a bipartisan way, with the gentlewoman's leadership, is certainly a day that should be applauded. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership.  Whistleblowers in the Federal Government should be able to tell their supervisor when something is going wrong. That is the truth, no matter what, especially in cases involving classified information which implies, Mr. Speaker, that it is a matter of national security.  Under the current law, whistleblowers dealing with classified information in the intelligence community can make protected disclosures to their supervisors. However, whistleblowers dealing with classified information outside of the intelligence community do not have the same protection.  With fewer legally-protected options, employees outside of the intelligence community may be more likely to make an illegal disclosure to people or entities without the proper security clearance.  Federal employees dealing with classified information outside of the IC community must be reassured that they can report wrongdoing to the appropriate people, including their supervisors.  With that protection, whistleblowers will be less likely to disclose protected sensitive information on waste, fraud, and abuse to the media or other entities or individuals without the proper security clearance.  This bill would allow whistleblowers to make protected disclosures of classified information to individuals within their chain of command, as the gentlewoman has already suggested.  There are very few conceivable circumstances in which a whistleblower complaint to a supervisor would jeopardize national security, but such disclosures are not currently protected.  There is no reasonable basis for concern about whistleblowers throughout the Federal Government having the right to contact individuals within their chain of command about waste, fraud, or abuse of a classified nature. These additional whistleblower protections will make it easier for Federal employees to do the responsible thing when it comes to classified disclosures.  I urge my colleagues to support this. I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership, and I yield back the balance of my time."

But before I do, I want to congratulate the gentlewoman on the passage, I believe, of her first bill here on the House floor; and go even further to say that, in keeping with this bipartisan support of H.R. 995, the Settlement Agreement Information Database Act of 2019 that was introduced, and is introduced, by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).  Mr. Speaker, transparency and public participation are critical to maintaining the public trust in its government. However, Federal agencies have increasingly resolved litigation by entering into settlement agreements rather than going through a lengthy public trial.  Now settlement agreements are often negotiated behind closed doors. Those secret negotiations effectively prevent the public from participating in important policy sessions.  Mr. Speaker, let me reiterate this. When these settlements are done, when they are actually consummated, they set up future public policy, and to do that behind closed doors is certainly not something that a transparent government should be about.  State and local governments, industry stakeholders, and taxpayers are often directly affected by these settlements, but unable to provide input.  For example, through the settlement agreement, the Environmental Protection Agency required the city of Fort Smith, Arkansas, to overhaul its sewer system in 12 years. Sewer utility bills increased by 167 percent in 3 years to fund the obligation of this agreement. At the same time, Fort Smith residents' income actually decreased by 11 percent.  The burden of a Federal settlement can be difficult to see and understand. Poor recordkeeping makes it impossible for Congress and the public to determine the full impact of the Federal settlement agreements.  Agencies release information about settlements at their discretion. Some agencies rely even on press releases to release the amount of information. So, as a result, the public only sees the facts through what the agency puts out and only in the most favorable light.  So, in many cases these closed-door negotiations, the terms of the settlement are deemed confidential. Without an explanation to the public, the process becomes even more opaque and seemingly arbitrary.  H.R. 995 will shine a light on Federal settlement agreements. This bill will require the establishment of electronic and publicly available databases for agencies' settlement agreements.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this particular bill, and I reserve the balance of my time."

I now know what that broad smile was about when the ``yeas'' were announced.  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government's duty to serve the public interest relies on transparency and accountability to its citizens; however, since the 1970s, Federal agencies have increasingly chosen to avoid a public trial and settle litigation behind closed doors. The resulting consent decrees and settlement agreements can mandate terms beyond the scope of the original violation of Federal law and can lead to higher costs than a trial.  These agreements are nearly impossible to modify or vacate, and in many cases can remain in place for decades. In one instance in New York City, their special education program has been under a consent decree since 1972.  This process has influenced a range of public policies across governmental programs in States, counties, and cities, with elected officials inheriting the burden with little knowledge of the mandates or cost.  In Alabama, for instance, when former Member of Congress Governor Bob Riley was elected Governor of Alabama, he was going over the budget and saw the amount for legal fees and asked what it was for. He was informed of the number of consent decrees that the State was under and they were paying out these legal fees, and it was an enormous amount.  States, municipalities, industry, stakeholders, and taxpayers are often directly affected by the terms of the agreements but are prevented from participating in the negotiations. In some cases, the settlements are declared to be confidential and the contents sealed, without providing any explanation.  Unfortunately, there is no uniform standard for recordkeeping across Federal agencies. While some agencies have issued directives to streamline and publish this information, most of the public's access to Federal settlement agreement information is primarily issued, as my colleague from North Carolina pointed out, in the form of a press release. It is, therefore, impossible for the public to determine the comprehensive costs and outcomes of these settlement agreements.  This lack of transparency leaves elected officials, agency officials, and the public in the dark about the consent decrees that can impact them. Oftentimes, newly elected officials, as I said, from Governors to attorneys general to mayors are sworn in and inherit substantial legal obligations they were completely unaware of before they took office.  The Settlement Agreement Information Database Act will address this problem. The bill establishes a centralized and electronic database of settlement agreements entered into by Federal agencies. Basic information about the settlement agreements already collected by Federal agencies, such as payments and dates, will be available to the public online through this database.  H.R. 995 provides long overdue transparency and accountability and standards to the Federal settlement agreements.  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Meadows) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Hill), for their support on this bill, and I urge my other colleagues to support this bill as well."

If you are not familiar with it, I would urge you to go to your local library, go to the card catalog system to get the right Dewey decimal number, go find a book, and read up on it, because apparently many in our Federal Government haven't realized that this has been created.  As was noted a little while ago, in 1974, there was an act called the Privacy Act that was passed--1974. Since that time, we have had companies like Apple and Amazon and Microsoft and many others that have proliferated and are now worth billions and billions of dollars, some of the largest companies in the world.  Mr. Speaker, this is similar to us having to mail in a form to get an ambulance to come to our house.  As was noted by some of the previous speakers, in many cases, people contact us because of emergency situations. We have had family members contact us when their loved ones were stuck overseas in emergency situations. We have had people contact us because there was water filling up their home and they needed emergency services at the time. Under the Privacy Act of 1974 that was written 45 years ago, we were unable to help them, as Mr. Meadows noted, unless they sent us a signed privacy release form.  I remember distinctly, in August of 2016, when we had a record flood in my home State of Louisiana, talking to constituents who were on their cellphones saying that their homes had 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 feet of water and asking for help with FEMA, the Small Business Administration, and other government services, and myself or other folks on our team having to tell them: You bet, we want to help you. All you need to do is go to your computer, go to this website, click the link, print it out.  You can imagine the response from people: I would love to be able to go to my computer right now. I would love to be able to find it, if it wasn't under 4 feet of water right now.  Incredibly frustrating.  Mr. Speaker, the government today has a customer service approval rating of 70 percent--70 percent is the customer service approval rating. While that was sufficient to get me through high school, that is not okay for the Federal Government. It is entirely inappropriate.  This bill simply updates the Federal Government to put it online with how we file our taxes, how we handle our banking, insurance, and virtually everything else we do, ensuring that when people contact us, we can use those same technologies to protect privacy, that we can ensure the right people are asking for the right approvals, and we can quickly, within minutes, begin providing them services through their own Federal Government.

It does not make sense to tell a State trooper that he can only pull over 10 people and then must stop, or a city cop saying: once you catch your second thief, she must stop.  Does the next person committing an illegal act get a free pass because we have hit some magic number?  Our country embraces the rule of law. We do not get to pick and choose, especially when it pertains to our national security.  I urge the Democratic leadership to withdraw this ludicrous proposal and come to the negotiating table. It is about time we work together, but we will not and cannot undermine our national security and the safety of our communities."

They ignore all the evidence to push their political agenda and discredit the President at the expense of Americans' security. They now have found a new excuse--the number of ICE's adult detention beds.  Let's be clear what this stunt is: a backdoor attempt to defund ICE, prevent them from doing their critical mission, and attempt to appease those demanding open borders.  I sincerely urge my colleagues across the aisle to come to the table to negotiate in good faith for the safety and security of all Americans. We need border security along our southern border which includes a wall structure, and we need ICE to achieve its public safety mission.

Talks on this issue are now stalled because Democrats are demanding a cap in the number of beds allocated to detain illegal criminals. But this new initiative blatantly contradicts what our leaders on the ground are asking us to do on this issue.  Just this weekend, the National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America both stated: ``Any legislation that reduces ICE's detention capacity would hinder its ability to perform its national security and public safety missions. . . . In order to meet the cap being tentatively proposed by Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of aliens from custody.''  The sheriffs went on to say that if the Democrats' plans were approved, then 9,000 illegal immigrants would have to be released by the end of the fiscal year. That is 9,000 criminals.  We need to focus on securing our border, funding the wall, and making our country safer, not protecting criminals and sending them back onto the streets to endanger our citizens.  We need to listen to these recommendations."

This brand-new cap on ICE detention beds came out of thin air and is proof that the Democrats are willing to do anything to keep from making a deal with the President and the Republicans.

Is there any solution the Democrats pose for securing our borders and our sovereign Nation?  They don't want the agency to have the capacity to detain more illegal immigrants who cross into the United States. Instead, just flow right in, increasing the risk to our citizens, as we see time and time again, especially in my home State of California.  Right now, there are 48,000 illegal immigrants detained thanks to the increased enforcement of our sovereign border laws under this administration.  Our county sheriffs are greatly concerned, however, that the new numbers that the Democrats are posing for us will release up to 10,000 illegal immigrants--criminals, even--onto our streets, into our country.  Instead of providing additional beds and allowing our Border Patrol agents to do their jobs, they have actually proposed to knock that number down to 35,000.

                "speech":" Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend our deepest sympathies, prayers, and certainly our thoughts to the family of John Dingell and Walter Jones.  I did not know Mr. Dingell and only came after and served with his lovely wife, Debbie Dingell, but certainly wish all of their family our extended prayers.  And the same goes for one of our North Carolina delegation members, Walter Jones, and his family, Joe Anne and Ashley, who served faithfully for North Carolinians for a quarter of a century.  Certainly, we will remember those, as we already have tonight, in our Prayer Caucus in praying for both families.  I don't really have any speeches written out tonight but do want to talk about a couple of areas that I believe are continuing to impact our country, maybe two of the foremost areas: border security, and then I want to talk a little bit about where our country stands in the pro-life movement.  Let me start with border security. This seems to be happening in real time. In fact, just last night, Mr. Speaker, I received a phone call from a local sheriff who is part of the 3,000 sheriff representatives in the National Sheriffs' Association. You see, they are becoming more and more concerned as we get less and less, as a body, concerned about border security.  They reached out to me last night and said: Fifty of us would like to deliver a letter to the Capitol to Members of Congress, specifically Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger. Our plans weren't to arrive until this afternoon, but we quickly made arrangements to be here this morning.  If these 50 sheriffs were going to travel all over the country, States from Massachusetts to Arizona to Washington to Texas, the least we could do would be to be here and to greet them, which we did.  On a very cold, rainy morning this morning, we met these 50 sheriffs on the Capitol steps, at which time they handed to me this letter, and I would like to read it this evening. It says:       Dear Chairwoman Nita Lowey and Ranking Member Kay Granger:       On behalf of more than 3,000 sheriffs represented by both      the National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County      Sheriffs of America, we write in opposition to Congress' most      recent deliberation to place an artificial cap on Immigration      and Customs Enforcement's detention capacity.  Now, I am going to explain this in just a little bit and get into detail.       Capping the number of detention beds utilized by ICE not      only jeopardizes the integrity of the immigration system, but      would cripple ICE's ability to detain criminal aliens and      other aliens who pose a risk to public safety or are a flight      risk.  They continue:       Any legislation that reduces ICE's detention capacity would      hinder its ability to perform its national security and      public safety missions but, also, impact local law      enforcement's ability to protect the communities they serve.  You know, we have heard a lot from some of our Democratic colleagues who say the people who should be making these decisions or the people who should be informing us of these decisions are the people with the most experience. Well, here is our National Sheriffs' Association, 3,000-strong, sitting representatives here.  They go on to say:       In order to meet the cap being tentatively proposed by      Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of      aliens from custody.  Now, listen to this data point:       To achieve the 16,500 adult average detainee population--     ADP--caps for the remaining 7 months of the fiscal year, a      net reduction of 9,264 adults by the end of this fiscal year      would be required.  Now, what does that mean? It means, if you are not meeting the caps, these folks, these criminal aliens, are going to get released.  You say, well, are these criminal aliens? Here is the number:       Approximately 72 percent of ICE's current detention      population is subject to mandatory detention due to the alien      having certain convictions or having committed certain acts.  So, of that number, 72 percent we know of, we are just going to say, or the Democrats want us to say, Mr. Speaker, that we just need to release these because we want to put a cap, just pick a number out of the air because we don't think we should have more than that, no matter what kind of crimes they committed.  This is ludicrous.  They conclude by saying:       Placing a cap on ICE detention beds would undermine the      efficacy of the immigration system and reduce the number of      aliens who are removed from the United States.  They use these words:       This dangerous congressional proposal not only jeopardizes      the risk of our national security, but hinders our law      enforcement officers from effectively enforcing and upholding      the law and protecting their communities.  There you have it. They are saying the reduction of these detention beds, which is just a backhanded way of defunding Immigration and Customs Enforcement, would hinder them from doing their job.  So tonight I am reminding my Democratic colleagues that, by pushing for the reduction of detention beds, these sheriffs, who serve for little pay and serve in dangerous situations in many places, in many remote areas, they are telling my colleagues: Don't do this. This puts us in a dangerous situation. This puts our communities in a more dangerous situation when we allow thousands of criminal aliens to be put back in the different communities on the streets.  This is preposterous.  The National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America oppose the current budget proposal and urge Congress to consider the dangerous ramifications that passing this depreciated budget could have on the citizens of America.  Mr. Speaker, these aren't my words. Mr. Speaker, these aren't the words of our minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, or our whip, Steve Scalise, or our chair, Liz Cheney. These are the words of our local county sheriffs, urging and pleading: Do not continue to push for this.  It is a real shame that these sheriffs have to come to Washington, D.C.--33 degrees outside, in the rain--to plead with a Member of Congress to try and stop such a preposterous suggestion.  As they stood today--and I brought them inside the Capitol, gave them a quick tour, even took them over into the Rayburn Room, and we talked a little bit. We talked about how structures work, how steel slats work. We talked about the places of San Diego and El Paso, where there has been a drastic reduction in crime.  You see, these sheriffs get it. These sheriffs are elected officials themselves and have a duty to uphold the law, much like the same oath that Members of Congress take to protect and serve the American people.  Structures work.  Now the Democrats, at the last minute, are trying another ploy by trying to come up with some crazy suggestion that we should reduce the amount of detention beds, putting a cap on it, automatically releasing criminal aliens. It is time for my Democratic colleagues to put up or shut up when it comes to being genuine about border security.  One of the things that we have seen recently is not only a lackadaisical approach about border security, but we have also seen it in the protection and the sanctity of human life.  Many Members are very passionate and should be so. You see, this isn't about an argument over how much funding a certain project should receive. This isn't about a preference on a particular issue that comes out of committee. The reason this has brought so much passion over the last 50 years is because this has to do with human life.  I can tell you, as a former pastor and being in the hospital room when a loved one breathed their last breath, I have seen how families had yearned for just another hour, another day. It is a very sad and tragic situation. They would have given everything they had for another few precious minutes with that loved one: a son, a daughter, a dad, a brother, a sister, a mom.  Yet we have cheapened life to the place, in these Hallowed Halls, that it has simply become a political pawn, a bargaining chip. How did we get to this place?  The other night, the night before the National Prayer Breakfast, I was speaking with a wonderful representative, a lady from the country of Latvia, who was appalled at our abortion laws, who are so much further than anything we see in Europe.  When we have to begin to talk about only six other countries that have such extreme abortion laws as ours, is that not a wake-up call?  When the Governor of New York, Mr. Speaker, continues to advocate with such lack of respect for human life, is that not a wake-up call?  When Governor Ralph Northam begins to talk about infanticide, is that not a wake-up call?  What does it take for everyday Americans to say enough is enough when it comes to human life?  Right now, we are trying to bring to the floor a Born-Alive Abortion Protection Act. What does it say? Well, it is not overwhelming too much. It basically says, if a baby survives a botched abortion, then the providers would be required by law to sustain its life. Yet we can't get it to the floor.  The reason why is because, when it was introduced last time, last cycle, we had several brave, strong Democrats who had the courage to step forward and vote for a piece of legislation that would require providers to sustain life during these times.  I remember I was so moved by that kind of courage nearly a year or so ago that I went back to my office and wrote thank-you cards to those Democrats who were willing to stand up for the sanctity of human life.  What is it worth to us? Not only is the Born-Alive Protection Act something that is important; I would even add another bill that was passed out of the House, not taken up before the Senate, the Pain-Capable Child Protection Act, that would limit abortions after 20 weeks to only specific circumstances.  What is it going to take for our country to put the kind of concern and the favor that God's creation deserves?  Speaking of God's creation, Mr. Speaker, our Speaker of the House, just 3 days ago, sent this tweet out that I will read. She said: ``We have a moral responsibility to protect God's creation for generations to come.'' That is why, today, she was naming a select committee not on the sanctity of human life, but on climate control.  We need to take a look at all the issues, but we need to stand as Members of Congress for those who cannot stand for themselves. We need to be a voice for those who have no voice.  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to continue to remind us that God's creation isn't just what we see in nature. God's creations are also these unborn babies. May we come to the place that we protect.  So tonight, as I talk about border security and pro-life issues, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a large animal veterinarian from the Gainesville, Florida, area, to share his thoughts on what we need to do secure our border."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding and putting this together. It is such an important issue.  I just left another meeting, and we were talking about border security. There shouldn't even be a fight, because what we are talking about is what we are charged with in Congress, Republicans and Democrats, and the President. We have all taken that oath, and that oath talks about protecting our country and upholding our Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic.  When you look at border security, that should not be a partisan issue if you focus on border security and take politics out of it--not Donald Trump's fence, not a party's fence; this is security for the American people.  Just last week, there was a bust of drugs coming in from Mexico in a load of bell peppers that had over 1,000 pounds of methamphetamines. It was valued at $1.2 billion, coming from our southern border. That came through a legal border checkpoint. That is border security that we are not doing that we should do that erodes the very social fabric of this Nation.  Two weeks before that, there was a bust of a legal truck coming in carrying cucumbers from the southern border through Mexico that had over 200 pounds of fentanyl. In fact, it had enough fentanyl to kill an estimated 55 million Americans--55 million Americans. Again, it came through a legal checkpoint.  So when we talk about border security, take the narrative and the argument off of Donald Trump's border wall and put it on Americans' border security. If we as Republicans and Democrats come together as Americans, we will have border security.  It is not racist. It is not trying to keep anybody out who wants to come here legally, which there are ample places for people to come legally. This is about securing the people in our country, the men and women who get exposed to these drugs.  In addition to that--and I don't understand why the Mexican Government hasn't done more about this. They are growing over 22 hectares of poppy fields. Poppy is used for heroin production. There is not a medicinal use in that quantity that needs to come into this country. The only way that is coming in is illegally, through either illegal checkpoints or no checkpoints, or it is coming through legal checkpoints where we are not emphasizing border security with the new technologies we have.  So it pains me to think of this country going through another shutdown that it doesn't need to because people want to play party politics.  You think of the young men and women in DHS, with border security, our TSA employees, our Coast Guard, Customs and Border Patrol, and ICE agents. They show up for work, and we here in this body can't come to an agreement about America's border security. It is shameful for us. It is embarrassing.  But when you try to tell the people who are in those situations--I know people very well who are in the Coast Guard, and when you say, ``Well, you just don't understand. They are holding up. They don't want Trump to have a wall,'' they say, ``I don't care whose problem it is. Fix the problem.'' In fact, one of them said, ``You know where you need to build a wall around first is around Washington, D.C. so you guys can't leave until you solve this problem.''  It is just a shame that we, together, as Republicans and Democrats, can't solve this problem. But, unfortunately, politics gets put into this.  If I may talk about the other issue the gentleman was talking about, being a veterinarian, I have come to believe, and my Christian values say, that life begins at conception. There is no doubt in my mind. The good Lord put it there, and I am blessed that I have had the experiences I have had.  In fact, I have been able to do embryo transfers in the equine, in the horse world, and I can withdraw an embryo from a female horse between 5 and 7 days of pregnancy. Even at that size--when you look at it under a microscope, it looks like a golf ball--it is a baby horse developing.  I think it is ironic and it is sad that in this country we have laws on the books that will protect the unborn turtle in an egg or the eagle within an egg, in a nest, and we have laws that say that it is a Federal offense and you will go to prison for it, that we will protect species, but yet when it comes to our own kind, the human species--that if you believe like you and I do and the majority of Americans that we are created in the image of God--I have seen an erosion of our society, and it pains me.  I know, every 100 years they say there is a breakdown of our society; but I can only think that this time around, when you are saying it is okay to kill a baby, full term, that is a breathing, living, creature of God, it is okay, that something is wrong in our society.  I think of that verse in the Bible--the gentleman will know the number and all that--that says:       If my people will turn away from their wicked ways and      humble themselves and get down on their knees, I will forgive      them.  And He says:       If they do that, then I will continue to bless them.  So, I appreciate the gentleman doing this. I have got some more facts and figures if he has time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Yoho. I appreciate his wisdom and his experience in this area.  As we continue to talk about these two issues tonight, I think back to the border security issue and how this has become more of a campaign against the President of the United States, when just a few short years ago, the majority of Senators, who were Democrats at the time, voted for a structure at that time, voted for a wall. It wasn't politically incorrect at that point to call it a wall. But we see how quickly in Washington, D.C., things do become politically correct.  Why? It is because we see the numbers. We see the work of our border agents. We see the work of ICE, which, in 2017, was able to ascertain over 800,000 pounds of drugs. Think about that, 800,000 pounds of drugs. Enough fentanyl to kill every man, woman, and child not just in our country, but in all of North America was ascertained.  A week ago tomorrow night, sitting right up to my left in the second row there, was my sister-in-law. Her brother was an Army veteran, wonderful young man, played basketball in college with my youngest brother. Scott Aaron was his name.  One day, he injured his knee, and he had to have an operation. From that operation, he was given painkillers. Painkillers went to opioids; opioids obviously included heroin, to the place where he became a full-fledged addict.  He tried multiple times to overcome that addiction to heroin but, in the end, failed and realized that, in his mind, he did not have hope, which brought him to the place of committing suicide.  Now, Scott is not by himself, to the tune of 300 families per week that are having the funeral of a loved one due to some kind of tragic overdose, mostly heroin. Now heroin is laced with fentanyl, and we are seeing more and more epidemic proportions.  We are doing everything we can in Congress to provide the funding to combat the heroin crisis, but why wouldn't it make sense that we also put up some structures, specifically in hot spots along the border, to help reduce and maybe even, in some cases, eliminate?  On this floor, I have talked with more than a dozen of my Democratic friends and colleagues who have told me time after time after time: We have no doubt that a structure works.  So why not move forward? Why not come to an agreement--a compromise, if you will--to be able to begin to lay out the places where a structure, a fence, a wall could work?  How many lives would need to be saved to make it worth it?  How many families could be reunited without an empty chair this Thanksgiving or this Christmas?  How many would it take for it to be worth it? How many would it take for us to get past the political jargon of being able to use this as some kind of pawn to argue back and forth?  I would say just one. The case could be made for thousands. Border security: It is time we come together. We don't even need to be talking about another shutdown or CR. We need to be able to resolve this. This is a commonsense solution to be able to resolve this.  Republicans aren't talking about a border from San Diego to McAllen, Texas. We understand there are places where drones, where technology, where surveillance may be the better way.  We don't believe in eminent domain and blocking people's views of the Rio Grande River with a wall, but there are things that we can do immediately. Yet I believe it has come to the place where we put personalities and politics over the people themselves.  Border security: It is time we do something.  Mr. Speaker, I yield again to my friend, Dr. Yoho, to have a few more data points on border security. Then I will close out in just a few minutes."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, as I was talking earlier about the drugs coming in, the methamphetamine and the fentanyl that is coming in, these aren't coming in by the honest farmer or ranch hand or farmworker in Mexico. These are orchestrated by drug cartels.  Keep in mind, the methamphetamine and the fentanyl coming into this country primarily comes via China, so you have nation-states that are sending products into this country. China is trying to re-create the Opium Wars of the 1800s with our youth in this country.  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Walker brought up the deaths, and I feel really bad for his family to have his brother-in-law go through that. I can't imagine the pain and the horror. There are 300 opioid deaths a week in this country alone, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  A good friend of mine, he is a heart surgeon in Gainesville, Florida. He said: Ted, that is just the tip of it. I have a young lady in, and it is her fourth heart valve replacement. At 25 years of age, the fourth heart valve replacement, because as they use the drugs, they don't use sterile techniques. They get infected. Their immune system goes down, and the bacteria will grow on the heart valve. Her fourth one.  I said: Tom, what is the cost of that?  He said: The average heart valve is close to $100,000.  $400,000, and if she dies, she doesn't die from a drug overdose. In the records, it is from heart failure.  So the 300 a week who we know are dying from drug overdoses, that is just the tip of the iceberg.  We talk about the cost. You can put a monetary cost on the deaths and the EMTs and all the emergency support staff and the ERs that we as taxpayers are funding, because, as he said, guess who paid for that? I said the hospital. He said: Absolutely. No insurance.  We can put a price on that, a monetary price, but you can't put a price on the disruption and the loss of a family member, as Mr. Walker's family went through. The price of that goes on forever.  If we look at just numbers, from a typical number standpoint, we get 2,000 inadmissible migrants arriving at our southern border daily. That means, since January 2, when the Democrats took over, 41 days approximately, that means there were 82,000 inadmissible migrants who came into this country or were trying to.  Of the family units--that is a spouse, a husband and wife, or just a mother and father with their children--in the last 41 days, that equates to 36,395 family units.  If you look at the illegal aliens arrested for homicide charges just in the last 41 days, it is more than 228 arrests.  Let's take politics out of this argument, and let's do what is right by the American people: fund our government, fund DHS, secure our borders with any means from above.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his passion about this."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Yoho for his comments tonight. I appreciate that.  Mr. Speaker, just a couple more thoughts on border security as we move forward.  America was built on immigration. Nearly everyone within the sound of my voice, even though the halls have emptied out tonight, can go back and trace, from some ancestry point, the impact that immigrants had on this country, but it is legal immigration.  Now, somebody might ask, how are we doing in that area? Thank you for asking.  America has the most generous immigration laws in the world. In 2017 alone, we took over 1.1 million immigrants who raised their right hand, who took an oath to pledge allegiance to this great country of America. We are doing pretty good there, and the President has even made proposals to increase that amount.  It is the illegal immigration. We don't want our hearts to get lost in this, as Republicans, and specifically speaking for myself, having worked in refugee camps, having worked internationally to understand the plight and the struggle that goes on, to be able to expand America as fast as we can, to legally allow people to be part of the greatest country in the history of the world.  Yet, as Members of Congress, when we raise that right hand to do our best to protect, we need to take that seriously.  The crazy calls to abolish our law enforcement, agencies like ICE, which in 2017 rescued 904 children who were being exploited, how many children would it take for it to be worth it, for Immigration and Customs Enforcement? How many of those children would we measure any success by this?  To go as far as calling for abolishment, that is not America. That is crazy political speech.  Speaking of crazy political speech, the recent absurd language that has become acceptable to talk about third trimesters and to talk about infanticide, what are we coming to in this country?  Listen, we don't pass judgment on the young woma who is making sometimes a life decision. Working with our own Greensboro Pregnancy Care Center, sometimes these young ladies don't even realize they have another option. We don't pass judgment. Do not believe the lies that this is about hating or judging these mere innocent souls.  The problem that I have tonight is the political leaders who are providing the pathway to cheapen the sanctity of our human lives. That is where the focus needs to be. It needs to be that colleagues, Republicans and Democrats, are willing to stand up for those who simply don't have any rights.  Who advocates for the baby? Who speaks out on behalf of the baby? It is all about reproductive rights. It is all about choice. It is all about what is now called women's healthcare. Who voices or who stands up for the baby?  As we talked about a little earlier tonight in our bipartisan prayer caucus where a dozen or so Members were gathered, I brought up the point it wasn't too long ago that I remember sitting in a prestigious place with my wife, being the honored guests. To add to that, I think back over the last 4 years I have served with the United States Congress. I have sat down with Prime Ministers and royalty all across this world to have opportunities to talk policy. But I am well aware that, in our life, the remembrance of a Congressman lasts about 15 minutes, maybe 20 minutes, once you are gone from these hallowed halls.  We are judged, in some ways, by our policy. But ultimately, what we do for God, to me, matters the most, when it comes to eternal values. One day, when we all stand before God, we will be judged not by just whatever button we pushed on the back of these chairs but, ultimately, what we did, I believe, with life.  That is why it is important to me. It is why it is important to millions and millions of Americans.  Let's get back to the place where we are willing to stand up, where we are willing to raise our voices for a child who cannot raise its own.  Tonight, let's get back to a place where we have a respect for the Almighty, for God, who, as I read in a tweet earlier, is the giver and the creator of life.  I think of David's writing in the Old Testament. I think of Psalm 139, where David captured quite poetically the words how we are ``fearfully and wonderfully made,'' how that even when we were formed, the beginning of our substance, God knew us. Not only did he know us, it is that he had a purpose and a plan for every life born and unborn.  May we never grow weary, and may we never tire of doing all that we can in the United States Congress to protect, stand for, and defend the sanctity of human life.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina. We in Florida all express our condolences for the loss of Congressman Walter Jones. I thank the gentleman for bringing that up.  Mr. Speaker, we had the longest shutdown in history caused by the President of the United States claiming the mantel that government needed to be shut down for his border wall. Then, finally, government was reopened as every party came to their senses.  As we speak, Mr. Speaker, we have Senate Members and House Members diligently negotiating a bipartisan border deal, four Republicans in the Senate led by Senator Shelby and three Democrats led by Senator Leahy. In the House, we have Chairwoman Nita Lowey, subcommittee Chairwoman Roybal-Allard, Ranking Member Granger, and Ranking Member Fleischmann.  I believe a deal is imminent, where both sides will deliver concessions and have to compromise. Yet, tonight, I heard dozens of speeches by my friends across the aisle on the one hand pleading for a bipartisan deal and on the other hand condemning Democrats with every other breath.  Were they not aware that there is a bipartisan negotiation happening as we speak that their colleagues are involved in? Devoid of reality, perhaps, or maybe it was just political scare tactics.  Mr. Speaker, when bipartisan plans come up before this body this week, and we show that we will keep the government open and protect our Nation, I know one other thing is for sure: My colleagues across the aisle are going to need a new script, because these scare tactics aren't going to work anymore."

                "speech":"Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Anna M. Pinellas. Anna M. Pinellas and her husband, Louis C. Pinellas, moved to Kissimmee, Florida, in 1981, after having worked in local government in Washington, Maryland, and Virginia.  Having knowledge in securing funds for various projects, she was hired by the city of Kissimmee and was able to secure grants for the infrastructure around Osceola Square Mall, the paving of Hill Street, and John Young Parkway, the first of those grants being $750,000.  She was also hired by Osceola County government to secure Federal funds for projects, which include bringing Head Start back to Osceola County, refurbishing the old courthouse, and the establishment of a salary plan for Osceola County employees.  One of her primary goals was to pursue the establishment of the Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. holiday in the city of Kissimmee, city of St. Cloud, Osceola County, and the school board. Thirty-four years ago, Pinellas founded Osceola Visionaries, Inc., a nonprofit corporation devoted to honoring and celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. before the holiday was observed.  Today, Pinellas continues to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. by hosting their annual banquet and holding programs for the central Florida community.  And for that, Mrs. Pinellas, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Beverlye Colson Neal.  Beverlye Colson Neal is the president of the Orange County branch of the NAACP and the former executive director for the Florida State Conference of the NAACP. She has spent most of her life fighting for civil rights, beginning in her early childhood, as a member of the Jacksonville Youth Council of the NAACP.  She has a wealth of experience in the field of civil rights, community, and political organizing. Her involvement has been centered around safeguarding the Black community.  She coordinated the 1984 GOTV efforts for the Congressional District 3 for Reverend Jesse Jackson for President of the United States, getting the only elected Jesse Jackson delegate from Florida from that congressional district. In 2009, she was asked by Dr. C. Delores Tucker to start a chapter of the National Congress of Black Women, Inc. in Florida. She has since organized five other chapters in the State. She has been instrumental in ensuring the programs under the NCBW-Orlando reflect the needs of Black women and their families in Orlando.  She is the mother of three adult sons--James, Odell, and Kenneth Neal--and the proud grandmother of five grandchildren. She has a committed passion for the work that she does in the State, and is always working for those who are ignored or overlooked. She feels that this is God's purpose for her life on Earth.  And for that, Mrs. Beverlye Colson Neal, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Johnnie Walker.  Johnnie Walker was born in Ethiopia in 1961, where his father was a technical advisor for the U.S. Department of State. He is now employed as a national representative for the American Federation of Government Employees, working for and with Federal employees performing the full range of employee and labor relations duties for Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  For 32 years, he has been a labor activist, advocate, and trainer, with extensive experience representing unionized bargaining unit employee members, and others. His advocacy has obtained over $500,000 in back pay for D.C. government bargaining unit employees.  Walker received his undergraduate degrees in political science and liberal arts from the College of Central Florida and Howard University. He worked as the constituent liaison for the late Florida Congressman Bill Chappell, Jr. from 1983 to 1986. He has received numerous recognitions from the D.C. Committee on Political Education, D.C. Central Labor Council, and the AFGE.  Walker represents Federal Government employees and provides community support and outreach to thousands of union members he represents, the most recent example being the ongoing support for furloughed employees by holding collections and distribution drives, town halls, and roundtable discussions to discuss the effects and seek solutions.  And for that, Mr. Johnnie Walker, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Cynthia Downing.  Cynthia Downing is a native of Florida; mother of one daughter, Cyntoria; and a recent grandmother of grandson, JaMarcus. She is a graduate of Haines City Senior High. She received her Bachelor's degree in Management of Human Resources and a Master of Business Administration degree from the University of Phoenix.  Ms. Downing is a lifetime member of the Haines City NAACP, where she serves as president. Her love of advocating for people and seeking justice has afforded her the opportunity to serve on social and economic panels. She is most proud of instituting the Black History Program, Black History Essay Contest, quarterly mission projects, a scholarship program, and the Drum Major for Justice Award. Serving in this capacity allows her to bring awareness and new initiatives to her community.  She always had a passion for helping others reach their fullest potential, and her management skills allowed her to start her own business as a trainer and coach. She also assists with vocational rehabilitation with job placement.  Ms. Downing is also active in many ministries of her church, New Mount Zion Missionary Baptist Church in Haines City. She serves as a Sunday school teacher, newsletter editor, website administrator, and president of the Shepherd's Care Ministry.  She lives by the quote her dad often repeated: ``To whom much is given, much is required.''  And for that, Ms. Cynthia Downing, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Anthony Gordon.  Anthony Gordon was born and raised in Avon Park, Florida. After graduating from Avon Park High School, he attended Polk State College on a baseball scholarship, and soon began his professional baseball career with the Seattle Mariners, Kansas City Royals, Chicago White Sox, and Milwaukee Brewers.  After retiring from professional baseball in 1996, he began working with Bill and Brian Jarrett to purchase and operate the Jarrett-Gordon Ford dealerships in central Florida.  Anthony serves as a board member for the Ford Motor Minority Dealers Association, as a Rotarian since 2002, and also served as a Haines City Chamber Board member, on the Board of Directors for Heart of Florida hospital, and was recognized as the Haines City Chamber of Commerce 2014 Citizen of the Year. He volunteers for the Great American Teach-In at Ridge High School, Bethune Academy and Horizon Elementary in recognition of Black History Month.  Mr. Anthony Gordon is a dedicated husband and father, as well as a longtime active member of New Zion Temple Holiness Church Association, where he currently serves as an ordained minister. He is a firm believer that his life's accomplishments are directly ordered by the mercy and grace of God.  And for that, Mr. Anthony Gordon, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Wayne Gandy.  In 1989, as a senior at Haines City High School, Wayne Gandy was recruited by Auburn University to play football. He was then drafted as a first-round pick to the Los Angeles Rams, where he played his first 5 years. Since then, he has played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, New Orleans Saints, and the Atlanta Falcons, having never missed a game.  After the NFL, Gandy focused on his foundation, The Wayne Gandy Foundation, organized exclusively to support and promote the power of sports in developing the qualities of leadership, social responsibility, and excellence through the sponsorship of sports camps, team building events, and programs that build healthy spirits, bodies, and minds of at-risk teens.  In addition to this, he also hosts a daily 3-hour syndicated radio show, the Sports Joc Show with Wayne Gandy, and serves as a color analyst for ESPN. Gandy still returns to his hometown, Haines City, Florida, and offers help wherever it may be needed. For the past 3 years, he has sponsored the Wayne Gandy Christmas Tournament, a semi-final high school basketball tournament in Haines City.  In 2017, Haines City High School dedicated the Wayne Gandy field to Mr. Gandy, thus showing how much his name is synonymous to the meaning of truly being a ``hometown hero.''  And for that, Mr. Wayne Gandy, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Lemuel Geathers.  Mr. Lemuel Geathers, from the historic Pughsville neighborhood of Winter Haven, Florida, served as the city's first African American Commissioner and Mayor. He was also the special assistant to Congressman Andy Ireland. He is a World War II veteran, and served as an electrician in the Navy.  In 1954, he went on to receive a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial arts and education from Florida A&M University. He spent 28 years as a teacher in Polk County, and one of his greatest accomplishments was serving on the committee to establish a junior college in Winter Haven, Florida, now known as Polk State College, because he knew the importance of receiving a good education.  He has served on the Central Florida Regional Planning Council, Winter Haven Hospital Board, Polk County Industrial Bonding Board, Polk County Master Planning Committee, and was chairman of the city's Human Relations Committee. Mr. Geathers was also the first African American chairman of the Democratic Executive Committee in Polk County.

Staff Sergeant George Brooks enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1954; 7 years after the USAF had integrated its forces. He was stationed in Biloxi, less than 1 year before Emmett Till was murdered in Money, Mississippi. He was also one of the first African Americans to attend electronics school.  While stationed in Spokane, Washington, he worked on the B-36 aircraft, becoming one of the first Black bomb navigation technicians to fly the craft, flying three missions. He left Spokane in 1956 for Westover Air Force Base, in Springfield, Massachusetts, where he first started working on the B-52 bomber, also joining the first ranks of Black navigators on that plane.  He flew 47 missions in the B-52, and was awarded the Air Medal with two clusters. Over the course of his 20-year career, he flew over 100 missions, until retiring from the USAF in 1974.  Mr. Brooks went to work for the Department of Defense for 13 years after that as an electronics consultant, until his retirement in 1987. He traveled the world extensively, with stops in seven continents, including Antarctica, finally ending up in Nalcrest, just outside Lake Wales.  Staff Sergeant George Brooks, for that, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I recognize Orrett Davis.  Orrett Davis is a growth marketer, startup advocate, and technology enthusiast.

As head of OTA, Mr. Davis was invited to the inaugural Tech Meet Up at the White House by the Obama administration, where he presented on the growth of Orlando's startup community.  Mr. Davis has made a tremendous impact on the central Florida community, and in addition to his work in Orlando, he has helped foster entrepreneurial communities throughout the country.

She encourages young people to seek higher educational opportunities by providing tutoring and financial assistance to college-bound students. She is a true role model for all women, not just women of color.  And for that, Ms. Deloris McMillon, we honor you. Mr. Speaker, in honor of Black History Month, I want to recognize Gail Paschall-Brown. Gail Paschall-Brown started her life in Brooklyn, New York, but was raised by her grandparents in rural North Carolina.  Now a Floridian, Paschall-Brown is celebrating 21 years at WESH-2 News, where she has served as an anchor and is a general assignment reporter. Starting in television while in high school, working in her hometown, Paschall-Brown did everything from shooting video for the city to doing commercials for advertisers.  Gail received a bachelor of arts in drama and speech, with a minor in broadcasting, from East Carolina University. While at ECU, she received the Broadcaster of the Year Award from her peers and worked at WITN-TV 7 in North Carolina. She served on ECU's first practicum program for journalists.  Paschall-Brown learned the business from all angles. Beginning as a tape jockey, she moved to reporter, then to anchor, and even did weather before Doppler radar was implemented.  In Florida, she has covered countless stories, including related to Trayvon Martin and Casey Anthony, and Polk County's Alejandra Juarez's deportation story to Mexico, that I am currently working on legislation for.  Some of Gail's most memorable stories include the first Gulf War, the Grenada Invasion, and Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons, tragically. She has interviewed notables, including Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm, author Alex Haley, sportscaster Jayne Kennedy, and did stories ranging from Bob Hope, Phylicia Rashad, to Pope Air Force Base.  Gail has received numerous community awards, including: being inducted into the Central Florida Association of Black Journalists Hall of Fame; Orange County Mayor Teresa Jacobs proclaimed Gail Paschall-Brown Day on April 30, 2015, for being a committed and engaged reporter who has shown integrity and compassion for the community; and that same year, she also received the Spirit of Journalism Oprah Winfrey Journalism Award.  She is most proud of her two children: Jasmine, a senior at North Carolina A&T; and Joshua, a sophomore at Florida Gulf Coast University.  After nearly four decades as a journalist, Gail says she loves this business still and hopes to continue serving the central Florida community.  And for that, Ms. Gail Paschall-Brown, we honor you.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time"
